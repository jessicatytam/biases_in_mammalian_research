Bates pers. comm.; K.M. Swe pers. comm.; Bates and Harrison 1997). It is often associated with limestone caves in Myanmar and Indonesia (A. Suyanto pers. comm.). On Peninsular Malaysia, the species has been recorded from primary lowland tropical moist forest (Frances pers. comm.). In South Asia, this species roosts in caves, mine shafts, pagodas and buildings (Molur <em>et al.</em> 2002). It is also found roosting in human habitations (P. Bates pers. comm.).","There are no major threats to this species as a whole. In South Asia, there currently appear to be no major threats to this species in northeastern India. The situation in Bangladesh is not known. However, disturbance to roosting sites such as caves by humans may pose a threat to this species as observed in Meghalaya (A. Tabah pers. comm.). In neighbouring Myanmar mining activities in limestone caves for manufacture of cement is a threat to some populations of this species (K.M. Swe pers. comm., Molur <em>et al.</em> 2002). It may be affected by hunting in some parts of its range (Francis pers. comm.).","As currently defined this is a common bat throughout much of its range (Bates and Francis pers. comm.). In South Asia, this species is distributed across three northeastern states of India, but the sightings are sparse and few between. Only two colonies of less than 100 individuals have been recorded in the last decade (Molur <em>et al.</em> 2002). In northern Myanmar, it is one of the more common bats living in big colonies.

Difficult to assess because the status varies in different parts of the range. The total population in the Mediterranean is estimated at fewer than 10,000 (but more than 2,500). It is estimated that overall the population is declining at a rate that exceeds 10% in 3 generations (for example in Morocco repeated surveys show a decline of &gt;75% between 2000 and 2007). Assessed as Vulnerable under Criterion C1. There is not expected to be a significant rescue effect from outside the region (in North Africa the Sahara has only very sparse populations and acts as a barrier).</p><p><br/><span lang=""EN-GB""> </p>","In most of its range the Striped Hyaena occurs in open habitat or light thorn bush country in arid to semi-arid environments (Hofer 1998; Wagner in press). It avoids open desert (such as the centre of the Arabian desert and the Sahara, though they may occur at low density in the central Saharan massifs), dense thickets and forests, and also avoids high altitudes; however, it has been recorded to 3,300 m in Pakistan (Roberts 1977), 2,700 m in the Moroccan High Atlas (Cuzin 2003), and at least to 2,300 m in the Ethiopian Highlands (Yalden <em>et al.</em> 1996). Striped Hyaena are sometimes found close to dense human settlements (e.g., Israel and Algeria). Individuals have been recorded 19 km south of Tel Aviv, 5 km east of the international airport and on the Tel Aviv-Haifa highway near Mount Carmel (Hofer 1998; and references therein), and in the suburbs of Algiers (K. de Smet pers. comm. 2007). Striped Hyaenas are unafraid of humans and frequently forage on garbage and carrion near to human habitation (K. de Smet, F. Cuzin and M. Masseti pers. comm.). Young animals are even kept as pets in some areas.","The major reasons for the apparent decline include persecution (especially poisoning), decreasing natural and domestic sources of carrion due to declines in the populations of other large carnivores (wolf, cheetah, leopard, lion, tiger) and their prey, and changes in livestock practices (Hofer 1998). Humans are consistently indicated as the major source of mortality throughout the evaluated range, largely because the hyaena is loathed as a grave robber, and because of incidents of damage to agriculture (e.g. in Israel) and livestock (Hofer 1998; Wagner in press). Striped Hyaena are very susceptible to accidental or targeted poisoning as it readily accepts strychnine-poisoned bait. For example, along the Mediterranean coast in Israel, the Striped Hyaena was exterminated by strychnine poisoning during the rabies eradication campaign administered by the British government between 1918 and 1948. The Striped Hyaenas ate poisoned donkey carcasses that were provided to control golden jackals, then the main carrier of rabies. Further large-scale poisoning occurred between 1950 and 1970 (Hofer 1998). In the Palmyra area in Syria, the species is heavily persecuted (including destruction or blockage of dens, poisoning carcasses, or the use of the fire to chase animals out of dens). There is also illegal trade in skins, and body parts for use in traditional medicine (as there is elsewhere in the range), and they are often kept in cages for display purposes (G. Serra pers. comm.). The species is commercially hunted in Morocco for use in traditional medicine, with various parts being used (especially the brain) and may fetch very high prices. Hunters may travel hundreds of kilometres to capture this species (F. Cuzin pers. comm. 2007).","Hofer and Mills (1998b) estimated the total population of Striped Hyaena at 5,000 to 14,000 individuals (see Table 5.2 in Hofer and Mills 1998b). Such an assessment of the current population trends of the Striped Hyaena is complicated by a number of problems (they are nocturnal, solitary, occur at low densities often in rugged country, sightings are infrequent, and surveys difficult to carry out). Moreover, in areas where the range of the Striped Hyaena overlaps with that of the Spotted Hyaena and the Aardwolf, few people acknowledge or recognize a difference between the three hyaenid species. Nonetheless, even if the overall population is larger than this estimate, based on their questionnaire survey, Hofer and Mills (1998b) found that the Striped Hyaena is already extinct in many localities and that populations are generally declining throughout its range.<br/><br/>As noted, Striped Hyaenas occur at low population densities. A large study in Laikipia District, central Kenya, estimated the minimum regional density at 0.03 adults/km² (Wagner 2006), while van Aarde <em>et al.</em> (1998) more than 0.016/km² in the Negev Desert (see also Table 5.1 in Hofer and Mills 1998b).",Decreasing,"The Striped Hyaena has a very large, albeit now patchy distribution, extending from Africa, north of and including the Sahel, and including much of east and northeast Africa south to about central Tanzania, through the Middle East and Arabian Peninsula, Turkey, the Caucasus, Central Asia, and the Indian subcontinent, though not reaching Assam, Bhutan or Myanmar. They may have recently expanded into Nepal (Hofer and Mills 1998a).<br/><br/>Although historically present, there are no reliable recent records of occurrence in Sudan, Eritrea, or Somalia in Africa, or in Qatar, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Pakistan, or Afghanistan in the Asian range (Hofer and Mills 1998a). Although the latter authors could find no recent records for Syria, there are recent records from the Palmyra area and elsewhere (Masseti 2004, G. Serra pers. comm.).

Because they exist outside of formally protected areas in regions where pastoralism is the norm and the potential for human-carnivore conflict is very high (for example, in Egypt and Kenya), particular attention should be paid to identifying ways to reduce human-carnivore conflict through promotion of methods that ensure adequate numbers of prey persist and/or methods that reduce livestock killing by carnivores (Wagner in press).",Afrotropical|Palearctic,,false,false,Mediterranean

Although they will eat fruit in a captive setting, they will always choose animal prey first. In addition to insects (including moths, stick insects, dragonflies, beetles, cockroaches, grasshoppers), they relish lizards and geckos. At Masmullah Proposed Forest Reserve, lorises were found in high abundance in areas characterised by <em>Humboldtia laurifolia</em>, a tree that has a mutualistic relationship with ants, providing abundant food for lorises. Lorises occurred at densities of 0.08-0.55 animals/ha across 15 separate sites. Loris abundance was positively associated with vines and branches providing continuous passage, branches of small size (&lt;5 cm) and trees providing a number of potential sleeping sites. Vicinity to human populations negatively impacts this species; it is not found in home gardens, and seems to require continuous canopy to move between forest patches.<br/><em>Loris t. nycticeboides</em> may possibly be more carnivorous than the lowland subspecies. As is this case with other primates at high altitudes, it also may occur at lower densities. The forest where it occurs has been classified as cloud forest, montane forest and evergreen forest at altitudes greater than 1,500 m (Schulze and Meier 1995), from 1,650 to 2,000 m (Molur <em>et al.</em> 2003). Of actual sightings, the highest was at 2,134 m and the lowest at 1,829 m altitude. Temperatures in its habitat have been recorded from 15.4°C (May/June) to -4°C (Dec/Jan) (Nekaris and Jayewardene 2003; Nekaris <em>et al</em>. 2005; Nekaris and Bearder 2006).","The threats imposed by humans on Sri Lankan <em>Loris</em> include habitat loss, road kill, and hunting for the pet trade, traditional “medicine,” and superstitious killing. Also, lorises have been electrocuted on un-insulated power lines. <em>Loris t. tardigradus</em> exists in few isolated forest patches that are also under severe encroachment by humans. Recent population studies estimate low numbers in forest patches and it is evident that both subspecies are in decline (Nekaris 2003, 2006).<br/><br/>Molur <em>et al</em>. (2003) list the following threats for <em>L. t. nycticeboides</em>: “land and water pollution, habitat loss due to agriculture, dairy husbandry, and vegetable cultivation, as well as local and commercial trade for eyes and meat by tea plantation workers, and possible village level trade for folk medicine”. While for <em>L. t. tardigradus</em> major threats are: “deforestation due to urbanization, and local, domestic, and commercial trade for meat” (Molur <em>et al.</em> 2003).","All populations are thought to be in decline. Population estimates suggest that there are approximately 1,500 animals of <em>L. t. tardigradus</em> in 3,000 ha of extremely fragmented forests, and about 80 animals in Horton Plains of <em>L. t. nycticeboides</em>. According to Molur <em>et al</em>. (2003) the total population of <em>L. t.</em> nycticeboides is unknown, yet this species has declined by greater than 80% in the last 200 years and is predicted to decline by &gt;20% in the next 10 years. <em>L. t. tardigradus</em> is predicted to decline by greater than 10% in the next 5 years (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003). These declines are based on the 1:1 relationship between loss of critical habitat and population number.

However, if conservation actions for the species were stopped or reduced, the species would very quickly move back into a threatened category. Hence the Near Threatened listing is a precautionary one based on Criterion A3 and A4, as it is suspected that if conservation measures ceased, declines over a 12 year (=3 generation) period in the future, or including both the past and the future, might approach 30%.","It is known from a wide variety of aquatic habitats, including highland and lowland lakes, rivers, streams, marshes, swamp forests and coastal areas. It is very adaptable, using saltwater as well as freshwater habitats, and even sewerage systems in urban areas. In most parts of its range otter distribution is correlated with presence of riverbank vegetation. Otters in different regions may depend upon different features of the habitat, but the important component of otter habitat, for breeding purposes, is the presence of holes in the river bank, including cavities among tree roots, piles of rock, wood or debris. The Eurasian otter avoids deep water. Their distribution in coastal areas is strongly correlated with the presence of freshwater. The location of breeding holts is not confined to river banks; there is evidence to indicate that sometimes the species breeds well away from water and the pups are moved to holts on the river banks once they are a few months old (Reuther and Hilton-Taylor 2004).","The aquatic habitats of otters are extremely vulnerable to man-made changes. Canalisation of rivers, removal of bank side vegetation, dam construction, abstraction of water for irrigation, draining of wetlands, agricultural activities and associated man-made impacts on aquatic systems are all unfavourable to otter populations. Pollution is major threat to the otters in western and central Europe, the main pollutants posing a danger to otters are the organochlorines dieldrin (HEOD) and DDT/DDE, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and the heavy metal mercury. Coastal populations are particularly vulnerable to oil spills. Acidification of rivers and lakes results in the decline of fish biomass and reduces the food resources of the otters. The same effects are known to result from organic pollution by nitrate fertilisers, untreated sewage, or farm slurry. In addition, major causes of mortality from several countries are drowning, road kills, and poaching. Fyke nets set for eels and other fish as well as creels set for marine crustaceans are very attractive to otters, and many that try to enter these traps are entangled and drowned. A further potential threat is strangulation by transparent, monofilament drift net. A potential risk comes from traps designed to kill other species, especially underwater cages constructed to drown muskrats. Illegal hunting is still a problem in many parts of their distribution range. In several European countries political pressure especially by fishermen has resulted in granting of licenses for killing otters (Reuther and Hilton-Taylor 2004). Illegal killing for the trade of pelts is on the increase in Ukraine and Danube Delta, and probably in the eastern parts of its global range (European Mammal Assessment Workshop 2006).","Expanding throughout most of its European range following historic declines up until the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s; although in the European part of Russia there have been recent marked declines, and isolated populations in countries like Turkey, Italy, Georgia, Armenia are still declining. The UK population started to recover in the 1960s (Battersby 2005). The population in Portugal is stable and did not show much decrease historically (Cabral <em>et al.</em> 2005). In Norway, although the range is increasing on the south-western coast, the population appears to have declined again since the mid 1990s (T. Heggberget pers. comm. 2006).",Unknown,"The Eurasian otter has the widest distribution of all otter species. Its range covers parts of three continents: Europe, Asia and Africa. Originally the species was widespread throughout Europe, but it declined dramatically in the 1960s and 1970s, and has disappeared from parts of central and northern Europe (it is probably extinct in Liechtenstein, the Netherlands, and Switzerland: Prigioni 1999). It is not found on most of the Mediterranean islands due to the lack of appropriate habitat, although it is found on Corfu (Greece). Little is known about the original distribution in Africa and Asia. Otters have been found in brackish waters below sea level in the Netherlands, and up to 2,400 m in the Pyrenees. Outside Europe they have been recorded up to 4,120 m in Tibet (Reuther and Hilton-Taylor 2004).",,Terrestrial,"It is strictly protected under international legislation and conventions: CITES Appendix I (Reservation by Russian Federation), Bern Convention Appendix II, EU Habitats and Species Directive Annexes II and IV, and EC 338/97 Annex A. Additionally it is protected under national law in many range states. A European Breeding Programme (EEP) for self-sustaining captive populations was started in 1985. Monitoring programmes have been established in many range states in Europe. Road barriers and tunnels under roads are required to reduce the impact of road kills (especially in countries like Germany where road kills are the main threat). Much more monitoring is required, but also better survey techniques are required. For example, the population on the Shetlands is well-surveyed, and survey results show no indications of decline, but evidence from other sources (breeding holts, changes in diet, etc.) indicate that declines are in fact happening (J.

It is difficult to quantify population trend, but it seems reasonable to suspect an overall decline, based on the data gathered by the Large Carnivore Initiative for Europe (LCIE 2007). There is unlikely to be any significant rescue effect because populations are fragmented and isolated.","Throughout Europe and Siberia, lynx are associated primarily with forested areas which have good ungulate populations (Nowell and Jackson 1996). In Central Asia lynx occur in more open, thinly wooded areas. The species probably occurs throughout the northern slopes of the Himalayas, and has been reported both from thick scrub woodland and barren, rocky areas above the treeline. On the better-forested southern Himalayan slopes, there are only a few records from Nepal (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Karan Bahadur Shah pers. comm. 2008).  Lynx occur sporadically throughout the Tibetan plateau, and are found throughout the rocky hills and mountains of the Central Asian desert regions (Nowell and Jackson 1996).<br/><br/>The Eurasian lynx is the largest lynx, and the only one to primarily take ungulate prey, although they rely on smaller prey where ungulates are less abundant (Nowell and Jackson 1996).  In European Russia and western Siberia, where roe deer are absent, mountain hares and tetraonids form the basic prey base. Hares and birds are important prey also in other Central Asian regions where habitats are dryer and less forested (Breitenmoser and Breitenmoser-Würsten 2008, Matyushkin and Vaisfeld 2003).  Lynx kill ungulates ranging in size from the 15 kg musk deer to 220 kg adult male red deer, but show a preference for the smallest ungulate species in the community (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).  Home range size varies widely (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002), but averaged 248 km² for males (n = 5) and 133 km² for females (n = 5) in a radio telemetry study in Poland's Bialowieza forest (Schmidt <em>et al.</em> 1997).  Densities are typically 1-3 adults per 100 km², although higher densities of up to 5/100 km² have been reported from eastern Europe and parts of Russia (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).","While China and Russia had annual commercial exports of thousands of skins in the 1970s and 1980s (Nowell and Jackson 1996), this trade has ended in recent years (UNEP-WCMC 2008).  However, illegal skin trade remains the leading threat to the species, together with habitat loss and prey base depletion (Govt of US 2007a, IUCN 2007).","The European lynx population (excluding Russia) has been estimated at 8,000.  Populations in central and southern Europe are small and fragmented, although there are larger populations in Fennoscandia and the Baltic states (Breitenmoser <em>et al.</em> 2000). Lynx in Europe occur in ten distinct subpopulations (IUCN 2007).  Detailed status and trend information can be found on www.kora.unibe.ch/en/proj/elois/online/index.html (ELOIS, the European Lynx Online Information System).<br/><br/>The lynx's stronghold is a broad strip of southern Siberian woodland stretching through eastern Russia from the Ural mountains to the Pacific, and the Russian lynx population has been estimated at 30,000-35,000 (Matyushkin and Vaisfeld 2003).  Although large portions of its range lie in China, status there is poorly known, and the government considers the population to be decreasing in a recent global survey of lynx status (Govt of US 2007).  While lynx presence in the Chinese region of Inner Mongolia is uncertain, in the country of Mongolia Matyushin and Vaisfeld (2003) estimate the lynx population at 10,000.<br/><br/>In a survey of 37 lynx range state governments, 30% considered their national populations to be decreasing, 35% stable, 14% stable to slightly increasing, 16% increasing, and 8% unknown (Govt of US 2007).  The population in Afghanistan is considered to have decreased (Habibi 2004).",Decreasing,"The Eurasian lynx has a very broad distribution from western Europe through the boreal forests of Russia, and down into central Asia and the Tibetan plateau (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).

5325996,15951,Panthera leo,Regionally Extinct,A2abcd,2010,2008-01-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Lions are extinct in the Mediterranean region, having perhaps survived in the High Atlas Mountains up to the 1940s.","The lion has a broad habitat tolerance, absent only from tropical rainforest and the interior of the Sahara desert (Nowell and Jackson 1996). There are records of lion to elevations of more than 4,000 m in the Bale Mountains and on Kilimanjaro (West and Packer in press).  Although lions drink regularly when water is available, they are capable of obtaining their moisture requirements from prey and even plants (such as the tsama melon in the Kalahari desert), and thus can survive in very arid environments. Medium- to large-sized ungulates (including antelopes, zebra and wildebeest) are the bulk of their prey, but lions will take almost any animal, from rodents to a rhino. They also scavenge, displacing other predators (such as the Spotted Hyaena) from their kills. <br/><br/>Lions are the most social of the cats, with related females remaining together in prides, and related and unrelated males forming coalitions competing for tenure over prides. Average pride size (including males and females) is four to six adults; prides generally break into smaller groups when hunting.  Lions tend to live at higher densities than most other felids, but with a wide variation from 1.5 adults per 100 km² in southern African semi-desert to 55/100 km² in parts of the Serengeti (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).  Pride ranges can vary widely even in the same region: e.g.,  from 266-4,532 km²  in the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park of South Africa (Funston 2001), and 20,500 km² in the Serengeti (West and Packer in press). <br/><br/>In India, the habitat of the Asiatic lion is dry deciduous forest.  The Gir National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary is surrounded by cultivated areas and inhabited by the pastoralist Maldharis and their livestock.  Domestic cattle have historically been a major part of the Asiatic lion's diet, although the most common prey is the chital deer.  Mean pride size, measured by the number of adult females, tends to be smaller than for African lions: most Gir prides contain an average of two adult females (Nowell and Jackson 1996).","The main threats to lions are indiscriminate killing (primarily as a result of retaliatory or pre-emptive killing to protect life and livestock) and prey base depletion.  Habitat loss and conversion has led to a number of populations becoming small and isolated (Bauer 2008).  <br/><br/>The economic impact of stock raiding can be significant: Patterson <em>et al.</em> (2004) estimated that each lion cost ranchers in Kenya living alongside Tsavo East National Park US$290 per year in livestock losses. Likewise, annual losses of cattle to lions in areas adjacent to Waza National Park in Cameroon comprised only about 3.1% of all livestock losses, but were estimated to represent more than 22% of financial losses amounting to about US$370 per owner (Bauer 2003). Consequently, lions are persecuted intensely in livestock areas across Africa; their scavenging behaviour makes them particularly vulnerable to poisoned carcasses put out to eliminate predators. Little actual information exists on the number of lions killed as problem animals by local people, even though this is considered the primary threat to their survival outside protected areas. Implementation of appropriate livestock management measures, coupled with problem animal control measures and mechanisms for compensating livestock losses, are some of the primary responses to resolving human-lion conflict (Frank <em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><br/>Trophy hunting is carried out in a number of sub-Saharan African countries and is considered an important management tool for providing financial resource for lion conservation for both governments and local communities.  However, there is concern that current management regimes can lead to unsustainable offtakes (Packer <em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><br/>Disease has also been a threat to lion populations (Ray <em>et al.</em> 2005).<br/><br/>In parts of southeastern Tanzania there have been alarmingly high incidences of people killed by lions, with up to 400 human lion-related fatalities recorded from 1997-2007 (Ikanda 2007).","There have been few efforts in the past to estimate the number of lions in Africa. Myers (1975) wrote, ""Since 1950, their [lion] numbers may well have been cut in half, perhaps to as low as 200,000 in all or even less"". Later, Myers (1986) wrote, ""In light of evidence from all the main countries of its range, the lion has been undergoing decline in both range and numbers, often an accelerating decline, during the past two decades"". In the early 1990s, IUCN SSC Cat Specialist Group members made educated ""guesstimates"" of 30,000 to 100,000 for the African lion population (Nowell and Jackson 1996). <br/><br/>The most quantitative historical estimate of the African lion population in the recent past was made by Ferreras and Cousins (1996), who developed a GIS-based model to predict African lion range and numbers, calibrated by surveying experts about the factors affecting lion populations. First they correlated vegetation (Leaf Area Index) with lion densities, using known values from 37 studies in 19 African protected areas, and mapped potential lion range. Then the reduction effect of human activities on lion range and numbers were estimated. Lion experts were surveyed in order to develop and rank a set of factors which would lead to lower lion densities as well as lion absence. These included agriculture, human population density, cattle grazing, and distance from a protected area, and were derived from GIS databases of varying age. For example, in areas identified as main cattle grazing areas lion density was reduced by 90%, and in areas identified as having widespread agricultural cultivation or high human population density (&gt; 2.5 people/km²) Lions were considered absent. Lion density was reduced by 50% in areas with low human population density (1-2.5 people/km²). Because of the age of their data sources on extent of agriculture and pastoralism, Ferreras and Cousins (1996) selected 1980 as the base year for their predicted African lion population of 75,800. They emphasized the need for ground-truthing their estimate by censusing lions, particularly outside protected areas.<br/><br/>Two recent surveys have provided current estimates of the African lion population, with some ground-truthing. The African Lion Working Group, a network of specialists affiliated with the IUCN SSC Cat Specialist Group, conducted a mail survey and compiled estimates of 100 known African lion populations. Not included were populations of known existence, but unknown or unestimated size. The ALWG African lion population estimate is 23,000, with a range of 16,500-30,000 (Bauer and Van Der Merwe 2004). The second survey was carried out by Philippe Chardonnet and sponsored by the International Foundation for the Conservation of Wildlife and Conservation Force (Chardonnet 2002). He also compiled estimates for 144 individual African lion populations, grouped into 36 largely isolated subpopulations. His methodology included extrapolation of estimates of known populations into areas where lion status was unknown, and his total figure is not surprisingly larger: 39,000 lions in Africa, with a range of 29,000-47,000.<br/><br/>Approximately 30% of the individual population estimates compiled by the African Lion Working Group were based on scientific surveys. Techniques for these surveys included total count based on individually identified body features, sampling by use of calling stations playing recordings of hyaena and/or lion prey, and mark-recapture methods including radio telemetry, photo databases, and spoor counts (Bauer and Van Der Merwe 2004). Seventy percent of their population figures were derived from expert opinion or guesstimate. In the other survey, 63% of Chardonnet's (2002) individual population estimates were based on expert opinions or guesstimates. Twelve percent of Chardonnet's (2002) estimates were based on scientific surveys, and a further 25% were derived from extrapolation of variables from nearby populations and catch-per-unit effort-estimates based on lion trophy hunting.<br/><br/>Estimating the size of the African lion population is an ambitious exercise involving many uncertainties. The three main efforts (Ferreras and Cousins 1996; Chardonnet 2002; Bauer and Van Der Merwe 2004) all use different methods. The African Lion Working Group compiled individual population estimates primarily from protected areas (23,000 lions: Bauer and Van Der Merwe 2004). In 1980, Ferreras and Cousins (1996) predicted 18,600 lions to occur in protected areas. This was probably an underestimate as not all protected areas inhabited by lions at that time were included. Still, the comparison suggests that the number of lions in African protected areas has remained stable or possibly increased over time. But Ferreras and Cousins (1996) predicted that most lions in 1980 were found outside protected areas. Chardonnet (2002) finds that unprotected areas still comprise a significant portion (half) of the lion's current African range. Comparison of Ferreras and Cousin's (1996) prediction of 75,800 lions in 1980 (roughly three lion generations ago) to Chardonnet's (2002) estimate of 39,000 lions yields a suspected decline of 48.5%. This calculation suggests a substantial decline in lions outside protected areas over the past two decades. Ferreras and Cousins (1996) may have over-estimated the African lion population in 1980, as their number was derived from a model rather than actual lion counts, and so it is possible that the rate of decline of the African lion population may be lower.  A group exercise led by WCS and the IUCN SSC Cat Specialist Group estimated that 42% of major lion populations were declining (Bauer 2008).  The rate of decline is most unlikely to have been as high as 90%, as reported in a series of news reports in 2003 (Kirby 2003, Frank and Parker 2003).<br/><br/>Genetic population models indicate that large populations (50-100 lion prides) are necessary to conserve genetic diversity and avoid inbreeding, which increases significantly when populations fall below 10 prides.  Male dispersal is also an important factor in conserving genetic variation (Bjorklund 2003).  These conditions are met in few wild lion populations, although there are at least 17 lion ""strongholds"" &gt;50,000 km² in extent (Bauer 2008).  <br/><br/>Outside sub-Saharan Africa, the Asiatic lion <em>P. leo persica</em> occurs as an isolated single wild population in India's Gir Forest.  The Gir lion population had been reduced to a very low number in the early years of the 20th century, possibly fewer than 20.  In 1936, 234 lions were estimated, falling to approximately 100 iin the 1970s, and estimates in the 1980s and 1990s around 200 adults (Nowell and Jackson 1996).  In 2005,  the population was estimated at 359, +/- 10, including cubs, based on, according to the Chief Minister of Forests for Gujarat state, a total count of lions by direct sighting in a block-system methodology.  This is an increase from 327 reported in 2001 (Anon. 2006).  The Wildlife Protection Society of India reported 34 lion deaths in 2007, due to poaching, electrocution, falling into open wells, and death by motor vehicle and unknown causes.  Single populations are vulnerable to extinction from catastrophic events, and it has long been recommended by scientists to establish a second wild population in Madhya Pradesh's Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary, but this has not yet been done (Jackson 2008).  The Asiatic lion shows reduced genetic variation due to small population size (O'Brien <em>et al.</em> 1987).  It is feared that the size of the population is larger than the estimated carrying capacity of the habitat and prey base (Nowell and Jackson 1996).",,"Lions are found in most countries in sub-Saharan Africa.  In 2005-2006 the Wildlife Conservation Society and the IUCN SSC Cat Specialist Group undertook an extensive collaborative exercise to map and assess current lion range in sub-Saharan Africa (IUCN 2006a,b; Bauer 2008).  Extent of occurrence is estimated at over 4.5 million km², 22% of historical range.  Most lion range is in eastern and southern Africa (77%).  Current lion status is still unknown over large parts of Africa, 7.6 million km².  <br/><br/>The lion formerly ranged from northern Africa through southwest Asia (where it disappeared from most countries within the last 150 years), west into Europe, where it apparently became extinct almost 2,000 years ago, and east into India (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).  Today, the only remainder of this once widespread population is a single isolated population of the Asiatic lion <em>P. leo persica</em> in the 1,400 km² Gir Forest National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary. Lions are extinct in North Africa, having perhaps survived in the High Atlas Mountains up to the 1940s (Nowell and Jackson 1996, West and Packer in press).",,Terrestrial,"<em>P. leo</em> is included in CITES Appendix II; the Critically Endangered Asiatic lion subspecies <em>P. leo persica</em> is included in CITES Appendix I. <br/><br/>In Africa, lions are present in a number of large and well-managed protected areas, and remain one of the most popular animals on the must-see lists of tourists and visitors to Africa. Most range states in East and Southern Africa have an infrastructure which supports wildlife tourism, and in this way lions generate significant cash revenue for park management and local communities and provide a strong incentive for wildland conservation.<br/><br/>Regional conservation strategies have been developed for lions in west and central Africa (IUCN 2006a) and eastern and southern Africa (IUCN 2006b).  The West and Central African Lion Conservation Strategy focuses on three primary objectives to address threats that directly impact lions:  to reduce lion-human conflict, and to conserve and increase lion habitat and wild prey base.  The objectivs of the Eastern and Southern African Lion Conservation Strategy are aarticulated around the root issues in lion conservation, including policy and land use, socio-economics, trade, and conservation politics.  For example, the policy and land use objective is ""to develop and implement harmonious and comprehensive legal and institutional frameworks that provide for the expansion of wildife-integrated land use, lion conservation and associated socio-economic benefits in current and potential lion range.""  The trade objective is ""to prevent illegal trade in lions and lion products while promoting and safegarding sustainable legal trade.""  Both regional strategies share common priorities of conserving and restoring lion populations, improving managemetn capacity, and increasing the flow of benefits to communities living with lions.  These strategies should be used by governments to guide national lion action plans, policies and programs, and by the conservation community to guide their project development.  By setting out common priorities to guide action on both national, community and landscape levels, the regional conservation strategies have the potential for broad and significant improvement of lion status and management (Nowell <em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><br/>For the Asiatic lion, resolving human lion-conflict is a high priority, as well as establishing a second wild population (Jackson 2008).",Afrotropical|Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Mediterranean

According to a recent comprehensive range mapping exercise (Sanderson <em>et al.</em>, 2006), most tiger range is found in tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests (700,991 km², or 60% of tiger range).  The second most common habitat type is temperate and broadleaf mixed forest (251,516 km², or 21% of tiger range), and the third is tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests (122,599 km², or 10% of tiger range).  Other habitat types in which tigers are found include coniferous forest, mangrove forest, and tropical grass and shrubland.  Photos of tigers up to 4,500 m have been obtained in Bhutan (Wang 2008).<br/><br/>Availability of a sufficient prey base of large ungulates is the tiger's major habitat requirement: ""wild pigs and deer of various species are the two prey types that make up the bulk of the tiger's diet, and in general tigers require a good population of these species in order to survive and reproduce"" (Sunquist and Sunquist, 2002).  Based on studies, Karanth <em>et al.</em> (2004) estimate that tigers need to kill 50 large prey animals per year.  Tigers are opportunistic predators, however, and their diet includes birds, fish, rodents, insects, amphibians, reptiles in addition to other mammals such as primates and porcupines.  Tigers can also take ungulate prey much larger than themselves, including large bovids (water buffalo, gaur, banteng), elephants and rhinos (Nowell and Jackson 1996).  <br/><br/>Tigers are generally solitary, with adults maintaining exclusive territories, or home ranges.  Adult female home ranges seldom overlap, whereas male ranges typically overlap from 1-3 females, a typical felid pattern of social organization.  Tiger home ranges are small where prey is abundant - eg, female home ranges in Chitwan averaged 20 km², while in the Russian Far East they are much larger at 450 km² (Sunquist and Sunquist, 2002).  Similarly, reported tiger densities range from 11.65 adult tigers per 100 km² where prey is abundant (India's Nagarhole National Park) to as low as 0.13-0.45 per 100 km² where prey is more thinly distributed, as in Russia's Sikhote Alin Mountains (Nowell and Jackson, 1996).","Tiger range has contracted by 41% over the last decade (Sanderson <em>et al.</em>, 2006).  The sharpest decrease in area occurred in India, where landscapes with tigers were found to be much smaller and more fragmented than previously assessed in 1997.<br/><br/>While the reduction in range is due in some measure to improved knowledge of tiger distribution over the past decade, Dinerstein <em>et al.</em> (2007) consider habitat loss and poaching for trade to be primary causes of a significant decline in tiger range and numbers.  <br/><br/>Asia is a densely populated and rapidly developing region, bringing huge pressures to bear on the large wild areas required for viable tiger populations.  Conversion of forest land to agriculture and silviculture, commercial logging, and human settlement are the main drivers of tiger habitat loss.  With their substantial dietary requirements, tigers require a healthy large ungulate prey base, but these species are also under heavy human subsistence hunting pressure and competition from domestic livestock.  Karanth and Stith (1999) consider prey base depletion to be the leading threat to tigers in areas of otherwise suitable habitat.<br/><br/>In the early 1990s, it was feared that poaching of tigers for the use of their bones in traditional Asian medicine would drive the tiger to extinction (Nowell, 2000).  Despite strong international action to eliminate it, illegal trade persists (Nowell, 2007).  Tiger bone has long been considered to hold anti-inflammatory properties, with some support from Chinese medical research, but many consider the effect to be more psychological than pharmacological (Nowell and Xu, 2007).  Although all countries have banned use and manufacture of tiger bone, illegal production persists in several Asian countries, especially in China, Malaysia, and Viet Nam (Nowell, 2007).  In China there are several operations engaged in intensive breeding (""farming"" of tigers), with the captive population reportedly reaching 5,000.  They are pressuring the government to allow them to produce tiger products, and several are already engaged in illegal production of tiger bone wine.  Market surveys indicate that medicinal use of tiger bone has decreased since China banned tiger bone in 1993.  Tiger farming perpetuates and threatens to re-ignite consumer demand (Nowell and Xu, 2007).<br/><br/>There are other illegal markets for tiger products, especially skins, but also teeth and claws (particularly in Sumatra: Shepherd and Magnus, 2004; Ng and Nemora 2007), contributing to poaching pressure.  But many tigers are also killed by people seeking to protect life and livestock.  Conflict-killed tigers can also feed into the illegal trade.  Many tiger products in trade are faked, a legal ""grey area"" in several countries which also perpetuates consumer demand (Nowell, 2000).<br/><br/>Tiger attacks on livestock and people can lead to intolerance of tigers by neighbouring communities and presents an ongoing challenge to managers to build local support for tiger conservation.  In some areas there have been many human deaths - for example, 41 people were killed by tigers in the Sundarbans mangrove forest of Bangladesh during an 18-month period in 2001-2003 (Khan 2004).<br/><br/>Sanderson <em>et al</em>.

(2006: 14)","Scientific efforts to monitor tiger populations and estimate their size have increased in recent years (Gratwicke <em>et al</em>. 2006).  A collation of national tiger estimates is given below.  While some national populations can be estimated with confidence (notably Russia, India and Nepal), most are admittedly more speculative, ranging from application of site-specific density estimates over large areas to outright guesstimates.  Putting all these national estimates together, the global tiger population is estimated to range from 3,402-5,140.  <br/><br/>A previous compilation of national estimates to determine the global population estimated 5,000-7,000 tigers (Seidensticker <em>et al.</em> 1999).  While most of these previous estimates were rough and lacked the scientific rigor that has gone into some recent estimates, so that a direct comparison is unreliable, a global population decline is suggested, as would be expected given the documented range reduction of 41% over the last decade (Sanderson <em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><br/>In terms of conserving the wild tiger's genetic biodiversity, population biologists prefer to work with a number that approximates the actual breeding population, the number of animals which raise offspring to reproductive adulthood, or effective population size (Ne).  The number of breeding tigers in one population was equivalent to just 40% of the actual adult population, based on long-term demographic studies in Nepal's Chitwan National Park (Smith and McDougal, 1991).  Therefore, the tiger's effective population size could be in the range of 1,361-2,056 reproductively successful adults.<br/><br/>National tiger population estimates<br/><br/>Bangladesh: Tigers are now largely restricted to the Sundarbans mangrove forest.  Estimating tiger density based on prey density, Khan (2004) estimated the population at 200.  A higher estimate of 419 was obtained by the Bangladesh Ministry of Environment and Forests, which carried out a joint census with their Indian counterparts (MoEF 2004), using a methodology of identifying individual tigers from their tracks which has been criticized as yielding inaccurate results (Karanth <em>et al.</em> 2003).  Based on the first data on home range collected from two radio-collared female tigers (11.5 and 13.9 km²), Barlow <em>et al.</em> (2007) roughly estimated there could be 95-286 female tigers in the Sundarbans.  Estimate used for global population:  200-419<br/><br/>Bhutan:  Dorji and Santiapillaai (1989) estimated Bhutan's tiger population at 151 (based on track counts) to 250 (extrapolating to unsurveyed areas).  However, the density they used for their extrapolation (1 adult per 40 km²) was high for the more high-altitude parts of their range.  In Jigme Singye Wangchuck National Park (where tigers have been recorded up to 4,500 m), Wang (2008) estimates, from camera trapping, a density of one tiger per 200 km².  A similar density for the central Himalayan region was obtained from track surveys by McDougal and Tsering in the late 1990s, 1 tiger/185 km².  Overall, their surveys estimated 67-81 adult tigers in Bhutan; this figure is used in the Govt of Bhutan's 2005 National Tiger Action Plan (Sangay and Wangchuk, 2005), although further research is necessary to clarify tiger abundance and distribution in the country (S. Wang pers. comm. 2008).  Estimate used for global population: 67-81<br/><br/>Cambodia:  Several NGOs working on tiger conservation held a meeting in 2004 to review data for the Tiger Conservation Landscape delineation exercise (Sanderson <em>et al.</em>, 2006).  Based on their work, using a range of methodologies including camera traps and field surveys by biologists and community wildlife rangers, Cambodia's tiger population was estimated at 11-50 tigers (Chheang <em>et al</em>. 2006).  <br/><br/>China:  The Govt of China, State Forest Administration, distributed a presentation at the 2007 International Tiger Symposium held April 2007 in Kathmandu, Nepal.  The total tiger population in China was estimated at 37-50, broken down as follows.  Amur tiger <em>P.t. altaica</em> (northeastern China) 18-22; Bengal tiger P.t. tigris (Motuo county, Tibet) 8-12; Indochinese tiger <em>P.t. corbetti</em> (southern Yunnan province) 11-16; South China tiger <em>P.t. amoyensis</em> (southern China) no definite evidence of continued persistence (Govt of China 2007, GTF 2007).  <br/><br/>India:  India's previous national tiger censuses were based on recognition of individual tiger tracks, and in 2001-2002 estimated the population at 3,642 tigers.  This methodology was criticized by leading tiger scientists for being inaccurate and inefficient (Karanth <em>et al.</em> 2003).  A new methodology has been developed as recommended by the 2005 tiger action plan (Govt of India 2005), using GIS mapping systems to extrapolate tiger densities derived from camera trap and sign-based indices of abundance.  The Indian tiger population is now estimated at 1,411 (range 1,165-1,657 (Jhala <em>et al.</em> 2008).  The Indian Sundarbans tiger population was not estimated.  Because of the difference in methodology, it is not clear how much of the reduction from the 2001 estimate is due to actual loss of tigers as opposed to a more accurate census result. <br/><br/>Indonesia:  The Sumatran tiger occurs in about 58,321 km² of forested habitat in 12 potentially isolated Tiger Conservation Landscapes totalling 88,351 km² (Sanderson <em>et al.</em> 2006), with about 37,000 km² protected in ten national parks (Govt of Indonesia 2007b).  The tiger population was estimated at 400-500 in the first and second national tiger action plans (Govt of Indonesia 1994, 2007a), and at 342-509 in six major protected areas (estimates from Shepherd and Magnus 2004).  However, incorporating more recent research (Linkie <em>et al.</em> 2006, Govt. of Indonesia 2007b), covering most of tiger estimated habitat (Sanderson <em>et al.</em> 2006), suggests the population could be 441-679 (see Red List assessment of <em>Panthera tigris sumatrae</em> for details).  Understanding of Sumatran tiger status will improve when research in the three Tiger Conservation Landscapes in Riau province by Sunarto <em>et al.</em> (2007) is complete.  Estimate used for global population: 441-679<br/><br/>Lao PDR:  No population estimates are available, and Lao PDR is not included in the global population estimate.  Tigers are known to occur in five (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1999) to seven areas (GTF 2007).  One of the largest is the 3,446 km² (+ 854 km² proposed extension) Nam Et - Phou Louey National Protected Area.  Based on camera trapping, tiger density there was estimated at 0.2-0.7 per 100 km², a relatively low density suggesting a population of only 7-23 tigers in the reserve (Johnson <em>et al.</em> 2006).  Tigers and their large ungulate prey have have been depleted by hunting pressure across the country, and tiger numbers are likely to be low (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1999).  <br/><br/>Malaysia:  Based on typical prey biomass in tropical rainforests, energetic needs of tigers, estimated tiger densities from studies carried out in Taman Negara National Park, Malaysia, and others in tropical Asia, and available tiger habitats in Peninsular Malaysia, Kawanishi <em>et al.</em> (2003) estimated the national tiger population at 493-1,480 adult tigers.  The lower bound coincides with the previous population estimate for the country (Topani 1990) and is the number selected as feasible by the country's national tiger action plan (DWNP 2008).  However, based on density estimates derived from camera trapping in six sites in Malaysia during the late 1990s, Lynam <em>et al.</em> (2007) suggest a lower  population, ""up to several hundred."" Estimate range used for global population: 300-493<br/><br/>Myanmar: The national tiger population was estimated at approximately 150, according to extensive surveys covering much of the country (Lynam 2003).  Most tigers (approximately 100) are found in the large Hukaung Tiger reserve in the north of the country (Lynam <em>et al.</em> in prep.).  Tigers have lost much of their historical range in Myanmar, and where they persist are at very low densities.  The other important area for tigers is the forest complex found in northern and southern Taninthayi Division (approx. 50) (Lynam 2003).  <br/><br/>Nepal:  According to government representatives attending the 2007 International Tiger Symposium of the Global Tiger Forum, a 2006 exercise, based in part on camera trapping, estimated 350-370 tigers.  The same number was obtained in 2005 and also in 1999-2000, and the population is considered stable (GTF 2007). <br/><br/>North Korea:  There have been no surveys since 1998, when tiger tracks were reported along the border with China (Miquelle 1998).<br/><br/>Russia:  In 2005 a comprehensive winter snow tracking census estimated 331-393 adult/sub-adult tigers.  977 fieldworkers covered 1537 transect routes totalling 26,031 km.  Using a similar methodology, 330-371 adult tigers were estimated in 1996.  The more recent number probably reflects more intensive survey effort (Miquelle <em>et al</em>. 2007). <br/><br/>Thailand: Tigers occur in 15 spatially disjunct forest complexes in Thailand (Smith <em>et al.</em> 1999), and were recorded in six out of seven forest complexes where camera trap surveys were carried out (Lynam <em>et al.</em> 2006).  The best area for tigers is Huai Kha Khaeng National Park, with an estimated 113 tigers (Simcharoen <em>et al.</em> 2007).  Extrapolating the density obtained from Huai Kha Khaeng (3.98 tigers per 100 km²) to the large 18,000 km² Western Forest complex, the largest habitat block for tigers in Thailand,  Simcharoen <em>et al.</em> (2007) estimated it could hold 720 tigers, with the potential to harbor 2,000 if prey densities were to increase.  However, this estimate should be treated as speculative pending further data from other parts of the Western Forest complex, where conditions are unlikely to be as good as in Huai Kha Khaeng.  For example, the distribution map in Thailand's national tiger action plan portrays appoximately half of the Western Forest complex population as low density in comparison to the Huai Kha Khaeng population (Tunhikorn <em>et al.</em> 2004).  In other Thai forest complexes, including Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary (Lynam <em>et al.</em> 2001) and the Dong Phayayen-Khai Yai complex (Lynam <em>et al.</em> 2006), tigers were few, occurring at much lower densities than would have been predicted on the basis of habitat quality.  Rabinowitz (1993), using presence/absence surveys and a modified arbitrary density estimate of 1 tiger per 100 km², estimated the Thai tiger population at no more than 250.  Estimate range used for global population: 250-720.<br/><br/>Viet Nam:  According to government representatives attending the 2007 International Tiger Symposium of the Global Tiger Forum, a 2004-2005 exercise estimated not more than 100 tigers in areas along the borders with Lao and Cambodia (GTF 2007).",,"The tiger once ranged widely across Asia, from Turkey in the west to the eastern coast of Russia (Nowell and Jackson, 1996).  Over the past 100 years tigers have disappeared from southwest and central Asia, from two Indonesian islands (Java and Bali) and from large areas of Southeast and Eastern Asia.  Tigers have lost 93% of their historic range (Sanderson <em>et al.</em>, 2006).  <br/><br/>Tigers are currently found in twelve Asian range states:  Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Russia, Thailand and Viet Nam.  They may still persist in North Korea, although there has been no recent confirmed evidence. <br/><br/>Sanderson <em>et al.</em> (2006) undertook an extensive collaborative exercise to map current tiger range.  Priority areas for tigers were delineated and are called Tiger Conservation Landscapes, or TCLs.  TCLs are defined as areas where there is sufficient habitat to conserve at least five tigers, and tigers have been confirmed to occur in the past decade.  The range map shows the TCLs, and maps can be viewed in detail at the Save the Tiger Fund website: http://www.savethetigerfund.org/am/customsource/tiger/mapping/index.cfm<br/><br/>A total of 76 TCLs were delineated, with a total area of 1,184,911 km².  TCLS vary in size, with the largest 269,983 km² in the Russian Far East and the smallest 278 km² in India.  Most TCLs are small: 61 (80%) are less than 10,000 km² in area, and the median area for the entire set is just 2,904 km².  Rabinowitz (1999) and Karanth and Nichols (2002) emphasize the importance of large core zones (&gt;3,000 km²) with a healthy prey base for conservation of viable tiger populations.<br/><br/>However, tiger range is actually smaller than the total area of TCLS, because most TCLS contain area of non-tiger habitat where tigers cannot live (average 55% non-habitat, ranging from 20-70% of a TCL).  The average amount of legally protected area within a TCL is shown below.<br/><br/>However, tigers do occur outside the TCLs.  The exercise also identified 543 Fragments with Tigers - areas of habitat with confirmed tiger presence, but considered too small to support a long-term population.  Also, 491 Tiger Survey Landscapes were highlighted - areas where tiger status is unknown, but where there is some reason to believe tigers might still be present, and which are large enough to support at least five tigers.<br/><br/>The Indian sub-continent (Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Bhutan, western Myanmar) is the bioregion with the most TCLS (40) and the highest number of TCLs assessed as being of global importance and of top priority for conservation (11).  Total TCL area 227,569 km².  Median TCL size 2,154 km².  Average percent of TCL protected: 15.8%.<br/><br/>The Indochina bioregion (Myanmar, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand and Viet Nam) has a smaller number of TCLs (20, with 6 of top priority) but the largest TCL total area of the four bioregions.  Total TCL area 540,758 km².  Median TCL size 5,288 km².  Average percent of TCL protected: 29.2%.<br/><br/>The Southeast Asia bioregion supports 15 TCLs, with 3 of global priority.  Total TCL area 145,285 km².  Median TCL size 3,884 km².  Average percent of TCL protected: 36.5%.<br/><br/>The Russian Far East bioregion (which includes small areas of northeastern China and North Korea) has just two TCLs, but includes the world's largest (269,983 km²).  Total TCL area 271,297 km².  Median TCL size 135,649 km².  Average percent of TCL protected: 9.9%.<br/><br/>Tiger range has been shrinking not only historically, but also more recently.  Comparison of current TCL area with a previous estimate a decade ago (Dinerstein <em>et al</em>. 1997) finds that tiger range has shrunk by 41% in the past ten years.  This discrepancy is due in part to technical reasons including a better state of knowledge and improved tiger detection methodologies (Karanth <em>et al</em>., 2003, Sanderson <em>et al</em>., 2006).  However, Dinerstein <em>et al.</em> (2007) consider tiger poaching and habitat loss to be important causes of this recent decline. <br/><br/>Although tiger range loss has been serious and steep, Sanderson <em>et al</em>. (2006) still consider 77% of current range to consist of ""known and secured breeding populations of tigers in areas large enough for a substantive population.""  Roughly half of all TCLs are big enough to support an estimated 100 tigers or more, with the largest seven TCLs offering the potential to support 500 or more tigers.  Even if tiger populations in these landscapes are below carrying capacity, these areas provide opportunities to increase tiger populations with appropriate conservation measures (Dinerstein <em>et al</em>. 2006).",,Terrestrial,"Tigers have been the focus of substantial conservation effort and investment.  Most range countries have developed or are developing national tiger conservation action plans (see Country Action Plan section of the Save the Tiger Fund website), and have called for IUCN to facilitate an international tiger conservation strategy (Nowell <em>et al.</em>, 2007).  A unique international conservation body, the Global Tiger Forum, brings together tiger range state governments with other governments and NGO members (GTF, 2007).<br/><br/>Tigers are included on CITES Appendix I, banning international trade, and all tiger range states as well as countries with consumer markets have banned domestic trade as well (although implementation has been uneven, and some legal loopholes remain (Nowell, 2007).  At the 14th Conference of the Parties to CITES, stronger enforcement measures were called for, as well as an end to tiger farming (the production of tiger products from captive tigers) (Nowell <em>et al.</em>, 2007).<br/><br/>National governments have invested huge resources in tiger conservation, including India, which has had a special Project Tiger program since the early 1970s.  Increasingly, international inter-governmental organizations such as the World Bank are also supporting tiger conservation.  Nongovernmental organizations have been very active.  S. Christie (in Sanderson <em>et al.</em>, 2006) analyzed tiger conservation funding by non-governmental organizations in the years 1998-2002.  Over $23 million USD was invested, primarily in India, Russia, Indonesia, Malaysia and Nepal.  The Save the Tiger Fund, funded in part by ExxonMobil, has invested 12.6 million USD in tiger conservation from 1995-2004 (Gratwicke <em>et al.</em>, 2006).<br/><br/>To address the threat posed by habitat loss and fragmentation of the tiger population, the Wildlife Conservation Society and the Panthera Foundation announced plans on January 30 2008 to establish a 5,000 mile-long ""genetic corridor"" from Bhutan to Myanmar that would conserve a large contiguous tiger population.  It would span eight countries and represent the largest block of tiger habitat left on earth.  The proposed corridor includes extensive areas of Bhutan, northeast India, Myanmar, Thailand and Malaysia, along with potential connectivity to Lao PDR, Cambodia and Viet Nam. It was endorsed by the King of Bhutan, his Majesty Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, who requested other heads of state to support similar efforts.<br/><br/>Sanderson <em>et al.</em> (2006) surveyed 77 biologists about the effectivess of conservation measures for tigers in the areas they work in (Tiger Conservation Landscapes), and compiled the results to indicate conservation effectiveness across tiger range.  Scores for 22 conservation measures are given below; high scores indicate high effectiveness and widespread implemenation.  Measures at the top of the list are widely implemented and considered effective.  Measures in the middle require more effort, and measures at the bottom are perceived to be ineffective.  Individual Tiger Conservation Landscapes which received the highest conservation effectivenss scores were in India, Bhutan, Nepal and Malaysia.

In southern Africa the Aardwolf occupies diverse habitats, ranging from the karroid habitats of the Western Cape and Eastern Cape, the grasslands and scrub of Botswana, the open savanna woodlands of Zimbabwe, and the inland gravel plains of the Namib Desert in Namibia (Skinner and Chimimba 2005). Recorded to 2,000 m asl in Ethiopia (Yalden <i>et al.</i> 1996). Throughout its distribution, the Aardwolf has been recorded to feed primarily on nasute harvester termites (genus <i>Trinervitermes</i>) and, in any particular region, mainly on one species; they are largely independent of water (except during prolonged cold spells), obtaining their moisture requirements from termites (Anderson in press). A comprehensive review of the species' ecology can be found in Koehler and Richardson (1990) and Anderson (in press).","There are currently no major threats to Aardwolves. In South Africa, the Aardwolf was previously persecuted by some farmers for the mistaken belief that it was a predator of livestock, chickens and eggs (Richardson 1984; Anderson 1988). However, such reports are not substantiated by studies of gut or faecal contents and probably result from mistaken identity with hyaenas or jackals (Anderson in press), and, fortunately, this perception has now changed and most farmers actively conserve Aardwolves. They are, however, the occasional inadvertent victims of problem animal control operations, especially those using gin traps (M.D. Anderson pers. obs.).<br/><br/>Loss of habitat, through urbanization agricultural expansion, may be having an important negative impact. For example, some farmers in South Africa destroy termitaria, using a plough or poisons, and these areas then become unsuitable for Aardwolves. Poisons used for locust control may also have an affect on Aardwolves (Anderson in press). Other mortality factors include predation by carnivores, and accidental road casualties, which are not uncommon as Aardwolves fail to move out of the way of oncoming vehicles at night (Anderson in press).","Although relatively widely distributed, the Aardwolf is not common within its range. In prime habitat (open grassland and scrub regions), densities may reach one adult/km² on farms with good populations of termites and no persecution by farmers (Anderson in press).",Stable,"The Aardwolf has a disjunct distribution in Africa, occurring in two discrete areas, 1,500 km apart, one in East and north-eastern Africa and one in southern Africa. Their distribution is largely determined by the distribution of <i>Trinervitermes</i> termites, which constitute their principle food (Anderson in press).<br><br>The northern population extends from central Tanzania to north-eastern Uganda, Ethiopia and Somalia, then narrowly along the coast of Eritrea and Sudan to extreme south-eastern Egypt (in the Sudan Government Administration Area) (Hofer and Mills 1998; Anderson in press). Their presence in Djibouti is unclear (Kunzel <i>et al.</i> 2000). A road kill from near Mbatwa in the Udzungwa Mountains in 2002 is probably the most southerly record for the northern subspecies (De Luca and Mpunga 2005). <br><br>The southern population ranges over most of southern Africa, extending just into south-west Angola, southern Zambia (apparently south of the Kafue River), and south-west Mozambique, but is entirely absent from Malawi, southern Tanzania, and most of Zambia (Hofer and Mills 1998; Anderson in press). They are not recorded from Lesotho, but may well occur (Lynch 1994).",,Terrestrial,"Aardwolves are present in numerous well-managed protected areas across their range.

Selective hunting of young males and subsequent distortion of the sex ratio has affected reproduction: recent research shows that heavily skewed sex ratios are resulting in reproductive collapse (Milner-Gulland <em>et al.</em> 2003). A second significant threat is the destruction of key habitats and traditional migration routes. Agricultural abandonment is a problem in some areas; cattle grazing formerly maintained the grassy species but land abandonment allows another species (<em>Stippa</em> sp.) to encroach, which the saiga cannot eat. The recent increase in steppe fires is a further cause for concern. Severe winters can cause mass mortality.","Historically, it was a common species in Eurasian steppes and semideserts. From information provided in recent references it appears that between 1991 and 1994, the global population of <em>S. tatarica</em> was relatively stable at just under one million animals, the majority of which were in Kazakhstan (approximately 810,00-825,000) (Bekenov <em>et al.</em> 1998, Lushchekina <em>et al.</em> 1999, Sokolov and Zhirnov 1998). Recent information from A.B. Bekenov and Iu. A. Grachev (in litt. to IUCN Species Survival Commission 1999) suggests that the population in Kazakhstan had fallen by spring 1998 to around 570,000 animals (a decline of ~30%).

Most are found in Kazakhstan.<br/><br/>In European Russia (Kalmykia), the saiga population steeply declined after land reclamation of the Volga basin started, but the species remained numerous within the distribution area. In the 1970s the population recovered to c.700-800,000 as a result of hunting regulation. However, since then the population has drastically declined. In 1980 there were an estimated 380,000 individuals, in 1996 196,000, and by 2000 just 26,000 (see Milner-Gulland <em>et al.</em> 2001 for annual survey results for 1980-2000).

Population trends are poorly known; although generally the population trend appears to have stabilized in recent years owing to better protection, it is possible that there is a slow continuing decline as persecution continues in some areas. In the western part of the region remnant populations are tiny, isolated, and under severe threat. Consequently this species is classed as Vulnerable (C2a(i)). The assessment is not adjusted because there is little interchange with populations outside the region. If better information shows that the overall trend is stable or increasing, reassessment should be considered.</p>    <p>Details of the Mediterranean populations are given below:<br/></p><p>1. Cantabrian.</p><p>The two Cantabrian populations apparently have been separated since the beginning of the century and now show genetic differences. Today, they are separated by 30-50 km of mountainous terrain and interchange between the populations is thought to be unlikely, mainly due to unsuitable habitat and a high speed railway and motorway. In the Western Cantabrian Mountains the population seems to be stable or increasing in the last decade and is distributed over an area of 2,600 km2. The most recent estimate using genetic methods (García-Garitagoitia et al. 2004) calculated 85-143 bears for the western nucleus, with an average number of 107. In the Eastern Cantabrian Mountains (20 bears) the population shows less potential for recovery, unless the corridor with the western portion is re-established. The total population for both Cantabrian nuclei may be approximately 100-150 bears; not all of these are mature individuals. <br/> <br/> 2. Pyrenees<br/> The autochthonous western population was estimated to be 3 individuals. The last documented reproductions occurred in 1995 and 1998. In 2006 the reintroduction action provided 5 (4F, 1M) bears from Slovenia mostly to central area. The autochthonous central population was gone before the last decade of 20th century. In 1996-1997 three bears were reintroduced from Slovenia. There was subsequent reproduction, including one male dispersal to Western  Pyrenees. Until recently the Western and Central  Pyrenees were treated as separate units. With the dispersal of one male bear from the central to the west portion the connectivity is now reastablished. The local bears have been totally isolated for over one century and had low genetic diversity. The recent reintroductions have resulted in the influx of new genes.<br/> <br/> 3. Alps<br/> The Central Austrian subpopulation now consists of about &lt;10 bears. After increases following reintroductions and local reproductions, in recent years numbers have declined again. No more than 4 autochthonous bears survived in north-eastern Italy until 10 were reintroduced from Slovenia in 1999-2003. With subsequent reproduction the population has exceeded 20 bears, and continues to grow; in 2006 a population of about 6-7 adults and 16-17 sub-adults and cubs was recorded. <br/> <br/> At least three individuals from the Trentino nuclei dispersed into Austria, Switzerland and Germany. None of them became established, but this demonstrated the connectivity of the habitat within the Alps and the potential for recolonization. One bear was legally shot in Germany in July 2006 because of the potential threat it posed to human safety (the bear repeatedly entered villages and broke into barns), whereas the other two bears disappeared without leaving any tracks. Occasionally individuals dispersing from the Eastern Alpine nucleus have reached the Central Italian Alps, confirming a potential connectivity among all the alpine nuclei.<br/> <br/> 4. Appenine Mountains<br/> An estimate yielded a figure of 70-80 bears in 1985. However, since then there has probably been a population decrease and 40-50 bears may be a more realistic estimate. Some expect this population to increase as poaching has been reduced in recent years, and areas surrounding Abruzzo National Park have been protected to secure suitable habitats. However, this population exists within a densely human populated area and there are potential conflicts between bear conservation and development and recreation activities.<br/> <br/> 5. Dinara-Pindos<br/> The population seems to be genetically very close to the remnant bears in the Alps. The population overall has been more or less stable in recent years. However, trends vary in different areas, with steady growth in Slovenia and Croatia, a marked drop in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the 1990s due to the war, and probably stable or slightly decreasing trends in the south of the Dinarids, whereas in Pindos range it is characterized as stable (150-200) with locally positive trends and recolonization of former range. The population size estimate of 2,800 is based on weak supporting evidence. Approximately half (1,400) of these individuals are mature, and the population is divided into subpopulations with each numbering less than 1,000 individuals. The population trend data is likewise based on little quantitative data and it is possible that the trend is declining rather than stable. In countries with bear hunting there might be a political tendency for overestimation to justify higher quotas. In Slovenia in the north this population is close to that of the Alps. There is not a continuous distribution of female bears in the Alps, but there is movement of male bears. In Greece in the south the nearest bears are those of the Rila-Rhodope portion of the Balkan population along the border of Greece and Bulgaria, but there is no evidence of connection.<br/> <br/> 6. Balkan<br/> It consists of two segments: Rila-Rhodope Mountains (520 bears) and Stara Planina  Mountains (200 bears). Little is known about genetic structure. The connections between subpopulations were recently proven, and there may be signs of recolonization. In the early eighties Carpathian bears were released in Rhodope and Stara Planina  Mountains. The numbers are not known since there is restricted access to this data.</p>      <p>7. Anatolian</p><p>The population numbers a few hundreds. The population trend has stabilized as a result of strict protection.&#160; </p>","Brown bears occupy a great variety of habitats from dry Asian steppes to Arctic shrublands to temperate rain forests.  Their range overlaps that of both the American and Asiatic black bear (<em>U. americanus</em>, <em>U. thibetanus</em>), and also slightly that of the polar bear (<em>U. maritimus</em>).  Elevationally they range from sea level to 5,000 m asl (Sathyakumar 2006). They occupy a greater diversity of habitats than any other species of bear and also exploit a large variety of food items.  In terms of diet, they fall between the mainly plant-dependent ursids and the carnivorous polar bear (Mattson 1998, Sacco and Van Valkenburgh 2004).  In North America, brown (grizzly) bears are more carnivorous where ungulates (especially in Arctic areas) or spawning salmon (coastal areas) are abundant (Mowat and Heard 2006).<br/><br/>The productivity and density of brown bears varies enormously, corresponding with the productivity of their habitats.  Coastal areas of North America and Eastern Russia, with concentrations of spawning salmon, have high densities (&gt;10 bears per 100 km²) of brown bears (Miller <em>et al</em>. 1997, Seryodkin 2006) with high reproductive rates (Hilderbrand <em>et al</em>. 1999).  Deciduous and mixed forests of the Dinaric and Carpathian mountain ranges of Eastern Europe also host high bear densities with high reproductive rates (Kusak and Huber 1998, Frković <em>et al</em>. 2001).  More moderate densities of bears occur across the interior mountain ranges of North America (McLellan 1994, Schwartz <em>et al</em>. 2003), Europe, and Asia where they forage on a great variety of grasses, herbs, roots, berries, nuts, as well as animal matter such as insects, mammals, and fish if available.  Moderate densities of bears are also found across portions of the boreal forests of North American, Asia and Scandinavia (Bellemain <em>et al</em>. 2005).  Lower densities are found in dry, desert-like areas, alpine and sub-alpine areas, as well as areas where habitat availability and numbers of bears have been reduced by high human and domestic livestock densities (Nawaz 2007); however, in most such areas (e.g., northern India, western China, Mongolia) density estimates are not available.<br/><br/>Breeding occurs during May to July but implantation of the blastocyst is delayed until late autumn.  Cubs, usually in litters of 1 to 3 (rarely 4 or more), are born in January or early February when the mother is hibernating.  In North America, female bears generally have their first litters at 5 to 8 years of age and have litters every 3 or 4 years thereafter (Schwartz <em>et al</em>. 2003).  In some areas of Europe, however, females generally have their first litter at least one year earlier, and produce litters every two years (Swenson <em>et al</em>. 2000, Frković <em>et al</em>. 2001).","Although, as a whole, this species is secure, with relatively large numbers and an expansive range, several small, isolated populations are threatened due to their low numbers and frequent contact with humans.  These small populations tend to be found in remnant wild areas surrounded by more extensive human development.  As wide-ranging omnivores, brown bears are attracted to areas with available human-related foods; being large and somewhat aggressive, these bears may threaten life and property (often agricultural products) and may be killed as a consequence.  Areas of high human use that attract bears may serve as significant mortality sinks (Nielsen <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2006).  Additionally, bears living near humans may be killed inadvertently (e.g., vehicle or train collisions) or poached for parts or products: even small numbers of bears removed from small populations can have adverse effects on population growth (Wakkinen and Kasworm 2004); conversely, preventing just a few deaths may avert a population decline (Wiegand <em>et al</em>. 1998, Garshelis <em>et al</em>. 2005).<br/><br/>Even where brown bears exist in a large, contiguous population, they are sometimes hunted for sport or killed for control purposes at unsustainable rates.  Estimates of sustainable exploitation rates are hampered by the difficulty and expense of obtaining reliable estimates of population size.  Many countries do not have the resources to develop, implement, or enforce adequate monitoring programs and sustainable management plans for brown bears.  Moreover, even with such plans in place, illegal take may equal or exceed the legal take.  This is apparently occurring in the Russian Far East, where brown bears are poached for the commercial trade in gall bladders and paws (Seryodkin 2006).<br/><br/>In addition to direct removal of brown bears, many human activities such as agriculture, plantation forestry, highways, hydroelectric developments, and human settlements eliminate, fragment, or erode the value of bear habitat (Proctor <em>et al</em>. 2005, Waller and Servheen 2005).  Habitat fragmentation is a serious threat that isolates population units with deleterious demographic and genetic impacts (Proctor <em>et al</em>. 2004).  With increasing human populations, the value of brown bear habitat is being degraded in many areas (e.g., Can and Togan 2004, Nawaz 2007).","The total world population of brown bears is estimated to exceed 200,000.  Reliable population estimates (derived mainly from mark-recapture or resight, and modifications thereof) exist for several areas in North America and Europe (Miller <em>et al</em>. 1997, Swenson <em>et al</em>. 2000, Bellemain <em>et al</em>. 2005, Mowat <em>et al</em>. 2005), but few areas in Asia.  Russia has the largest number of brown bears, believed to exceed 100,000, while estimates in the U.S. are around 33,000, Canada 25,000, and Europe (excluding Russia) 14,000.  <br/><br/>Whereas the species is relatively abundant in more northern parts of its distribution, the southern portions of the range are highly fragmented, with many small populations.  In North America, the southern fringe has isolated populations ranging in size from over 500 in and around Yellowstone National Park (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2005) to approximately 15 individuals in the Cabinet Mountains of Montana (Proctor <em>et al</em>. 2004).  <br/><br/>In southern Europe there are several extremely small, isolated populations: two populations in the Pyrenees (France and Spain) each have &lt;10 bears, two populations in the Cantabrian Mountains (Spain) contain 20-30 and 80-100 bears, a population in the Appenine Mountains (Italy) has 40-50 bears, and the Alps (Italy, Austria, and Slovenia) has 35-40 bears (Swenson <em>et al</em>. 2000; http://www.largecarnivores.maverik.ch/bear-ois/index.htm).  <br/><br/>Small populations of brown bears are also scattered across many portions of Asia, but little is known of numbers or connectivity.  In Pakistan there are an estimated 150–200 bears in seven separate populations in the Himalaya, Karakoram and Hindu Kush Ranges, only one of which has more than 20 individuals (Nawaz 2007).  In India, brown bears exist in 23 protected areas in the northern states of Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, and Uttaranchal, but they are regarded as fairly common in only two of these; country-wide there are likely &lt;1,000 individuals, and possibly half that (Sathyakumar 2006).  In China, brown bears exist is sparse, poorly defined populations in the west and also in the northeast, with guesstimates of ~6,000 and ~1,000 in each of these regions, respectively (Gong and Harris 2006).  A more dense population on Hokkaido, Japan may have 2,000+ brown bears, although even there, where significant information has been collected through research and sport harvest returns, reliable population estimates are not available (Mano 2006).",Stable,"The brown bear is the most widely distributed ursid.  It once ranged across a large portion of North America, including northern Mexico (plus, at one time, much of the eastern half of the continent), throughout Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and even across North Africa.  It presently occupies approximately 5,000,000 km² of the northwestern portion of North America, 800,000 km² of Europe (excluding Russia), and much of northern Asia.  The largest numbers exist in Russia, U.S. (Alaska), and Canada.  Many populations in Europe, and the more southerly portions of Asia and North America are small and isolated (Servheen <em>et al</em>. 1999, Swenson <em>et al</em>. 2000).  A history of prolonged over-exploitation in Europe stretching back centuries resulted in the elimination of brown bears from many countries.  The date of their extirpation from North Africa is uncertain, but they may have existed as late as the 1500s in the Sinai of Egypt (Manlius 1998) and mid-1800s in Algeria and Morocco (Hamdine <em>et al</em>. 1998).  During the 20th Century, brown bears (called grizzly bears in interior North America) were extirpated in Mexico and a large portion of southwestern U.S. (Brown 1985, Mattson and Merrill 2002), while in Asia and the Middle East they have apparently been eliminated from Syria, and possibly Bhutan.  Very small numbers of brown bears still remain in Iraq and Nepal (Gurung 2004, Ridings 2006).  Andorra was reoccupied in 2003 from bears reintroduced into the French Pyrenees.  A few wandering individuals recently crossed into Switzerland from Italy and into Lithuania from Latvia and Belarus, but not enough as yet to be considered extant populations.<br/><br/>The brown bear currently occurs in Afghanistan, Albania, Andorra (recently reoccupied), Armenia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bhutan (possibly extinct), Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Canada, China, Croatia, Czech Republic (possibly only vagrants), Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Greece, India, Iraq, Islamic Republic of Iran, Italy, Japan, Kazakhstan, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Mongolia, Montenegro, Nepal, Norway, Pakistan, Poland, Romania, Russian Federation, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Tajikistan, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, United States, and Uzbekistan. The species has become Extinct during past 500 years in Algeria, Egypt, Germany, Hungary, Israel, Lebanon, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Mexico, Moldova, Morocco, Palestinian Territory (Occupied), Portugal, San Marino, Switzerland, and Syrian Arab Republic. Extinctions due to human agency have taken place more than 500 years ago in Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, Jordan, Luxembourg, Monaco, Netherlands, Tunisia, United Kingdom, and the Vatican.",,Terrestrial,"Conservation actions for brown bears vary greatly among nations and regions within nations.  Large populations of this species (in Russia, Japan, Canada, Alaska, and parts of eastern and northern Europe) are legally hunted, and thus managed as a game animal.  Hunting regulations designed to ensure a sustainable harvest of bears vary among areas but often involve a lottery for a limited number of permits, a quota system, and restricted season length.  <br/><br/>Most small populations are legally protected by national laws and international agreements, with varying degrees of enforcement.  All international trade in brown bears is restricted by either CITES I (in parts of central Asia) or CITES II.  In parts of the U.S., small populations of grizzly bears have successfully rebounded under protection of the Endangered Species Act (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2005). Reintroductions and population augmentations also have helped to restore numbers and geographic range in several locations in the U.S. and Western Europe (Servheen <em>et al</em>. 1994, Clark <em>et al</em>. 2002).  <br/><br/>There are numerous protected areas around the world with brown bears, but few are large enough to support a viable population; therefore, brown bear conservation must be integrated with many other human land-uses (Herrero 1994, Nielsen <em>et al</em>. 2006).  Some countries have rules or management guidelines designed to reduce human impacts on brown bears and their habitat, whereas in other countries bear management protocols and regulations are limited or nonexistent (Servheen <em>et al</em>. 1999, Zedrosser <em>et al</em>. 2001).",Indomalayan|Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Mediterranean

Although they are primarily hunters of their own food, they may pirate food from other carnivores and will also scavenge from the kills of larger animals (Begg <i>et al.</i> in press).

There is evidence to suggest they have gone locally extinct in many areas due to poisoning (K. Begg and C. Begg pers. comm. 2006). Ratel body parts (particularly paws, skin and organs) are commonly used in traditional medicine because of their reputation for fearlessness and tenacity. In some areas (Zambia, Guinea), Ratels appear on the bushmeat trade due to the decline in other more favoured bushmeat species (Colyn <i>et al</i>. 2004; Begg <i>et al</i>. in press).

They are primarily insectivorous (Nekaris and Jayewardene 2004). <em>Loris lydekkerianus nordicus</em> is apparently able to survive well near human habitations (Nekaris and Jayewardene 2003), as it was found more often associated with disturbed human habitation than with forest (Nekaris and Jayewardene 2004); similar trends in India were found by Singh <em>et al.</em> (1999) and were associated with agricultural pest abundance. The highest densities of lorises on Sri Lanka occurred in the dry zone forests; also, the presence of species of this genus is positively associated with insect presence, and negatively associated with secondary forest with little undergrowth (Nekaris and Jayewardene 2004; Kumara <em>et al.</em> 2006). <em>L. l. nordicus</em> and <em>L.l. lydekkarianus</em> seem to rely heavily on undergrowth, and are often found in secondary growth forest (Nekaris and Jayewardene 2004; Radhakrishna and Singh 2002). Singh <em>et al</em>. (1999) found that relatively open forest and adjoining croplands are the preferred habitat types of lorises in the Dindigul Forests of Tamil Nadu, India. <em>L. l. malabaricus</em> is found to occur more in cardamom plantations and in degraded and stunted rainforests than in primary rainforests (Kumara <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>This species is characterized by a multiple-male/multiple-female social system of spatial overlap.

It roosts in large groups consisting of thousands of individuals in caves in forested areas. They are more often found in disturbed and agricultural areas, although they do occur in primary forest as well. It is a nectar eating bat with a slow flight, and has adapted to using the flowers of many important agricultural and orchard crops (Smith and Xie 2008). It breeds throughout the year and produces one young (Bates and Harrison 1997).

It is possible that some animals may persist in Egypt, but there is no recent information available (Moehlman <em>et al.</em> in press). The entire global population of this species is tiny and at serious risk of extinction.","The primary habitat is arid and semi-arid bushland and grassland. In Eritrea and Ethiopia, the African Wild Ass lives in volcanic landscape of the Great Rift Valley where they range from below sea level in the Dalool Depression to 2,000 m asl (Moehlman <em>et al.</em> in press).<br/><br/>In Eritrea and Ethiopia, limited observations indicate that African Wild Asses are primarily grazers, but that they will also utilize browse. Typical of arid habitat equids, the only stable groups are composed of a female and her offspring. Females do associate with other females or with males, but even temporary groups are small. Low density and low sociability may be due to low forage quality and availability. In the Mille-Serdo Wild Ass Reserve the preferred forage is <em>Aristida</em> sp, <em>Chrysopogon plumulosus</em>, <em>Dactyloctenium schindicum</em>, <em>Digiteria</em> sp, <em>Lasiurus scindicus</em>, and <em>Sporobolus iocladus</em> (Kebede 1999; Moehlman 2002; Moehlman <em>et al</em>. in press).  In Eritrea, <em>Pannicum turgidium</em> is an important forage species (Teclai 2006).","The major threat to the African Wild Ass is hunting for food and medicinal purposes; for example, body parts and soup made from bones are used for treating tuberculosis, constipation, rheumatism, backache, and boneache (Kebede 1999; Moehlman 2002; Moehlman <em>et al.</em> in press). Limited access to drinking water and forage (largely due to competition with livestock) is also a major constraint, with reproductive females and foals less than three-months old most at risk. Hence, it will continue to be important to determine critical water supplies and basic forage requirements, allowing management authorities to determine (in consultation with local pastoralists) how to conserve the African Wild Ass (Kebede 1999, 2007; Moehlman 2002; Teclai 2006; Moehlman <em>et al</em>. in press). The third major threat to the survival of the African Wild Ass is possible interbreeding with the domestic donkey (Moehlman 2002; Moehlman <em>et al</em>. in press).","In Ethiopia, there has been a severe population decline since the early 1970s. Klingel (1972) recorded group sizes of 10-30 individuals in the Danakil, and he estimated a density of 18.6 wild asses per 100 km² in an area of approximately 10,000 km². During that survey, Yangudi-Rassa National Park had the highest density (30 wild asses per 100 km²). In 1994, Moehlman and Kebede did a ground survey of the Yangudi-Rassa N.P.; no wild asses were seen, although local Issa pastoralists reported that they were present but rare and occurred at an approximate density well below one animal per 100 km² (Moehlman 1994; Kebede 1995; Moehlman <em>et al.</em> 1998). In 2007, Kebede (F. Kebede <em>et al.</em> pers. comm. 2007) surveyed the historic range of the African Wild Ass in Ethiopia and determined that they have been extirpated from the Yangudi-Rassa N.P. and the Somali Region and that the only remaining population is in the north-eastern Afar Region. The total number of wild ass observed during this survey was 25 in an area of 4,000 km² yielding a density of 0.625 animals per 100 km². This density is higher than that of 1994-1998 survey, which was 0.5 wild ass per 100 km² in an area of 2,000 km² (Moehlman 2002). In the Serdo-Hillu area, where there has been a research and conservation programme with Ethiopian Wildlife Conservation Authority and local Afar pastoralists for the past ten years, the population has remained stable. Although the number of African Wild Ass in this area has not declined, the population is very small and under high risk of extinction. There may be fewer than 200 African Wild Ass left in Ethiopia.<br/><br/>In Eritrea, there are limited long-term data. The first successful survey was made in 1996 and there has been a research and conservation programme with the Ministry of Agriculture for the past ten years. The main study site in the Northern Red Sea Zone has had a population of roughly 47 individuals per 100 km² (Moehlman <em>et al</em>. 1998; Moehlman 2002). This is the highest population density found anywhere in the present range of the species and is similar to population densities recorded in Ethiopia in the early 1970s. This is a limited study area (100 km²), but recent research indicates that African Wild Ass currently inhabit approximately 11,000 km² in the Denkeli desert (Teclai 2006). Surveys are needed to determine the distribution and density of African Wild Ass in this larger area. A rough estimate of African Wild Ass in Eritrea would yield a total of possibly 400 individuals. <br/><br/>In Somalia, in 1997, local pastoralists said that there were less than 10 African Wild Ass left in the Nugaal Valley; an earlier ground survey in 1989 in the Nugaal Valley yielded population estimates of roughly 135-205 animals or approximately 2.7-4.1/km² (Moehlman 1998). Some animals may remain near Meit and Erigavo, but this area has not been surveyed since the 1970s (Moehlman <em>et al</em>. in press). It is not known if African Wild Ass currently persist in Somalia.<br/><br/>In summary, the total number of observed African Wild Ass in Eritrea and Ethiopia is 70 individuals; there may be as many as 600 individuals in these two countries, but this figure is a very rough extrapolation from more intensely studied areas. The number of mature individuals is approximately one-third of the population (Feh <em>et al</em>. 2001), hence the minimum number of mature individuals is 23 and the maximum might be 200. In Ethiopia, in the last 35 years there has been a greater that 95% population decline and in the last 12 years the African Wild Ass has been extirpated from roughly 50% of its range (Kebede <em>et al</em>. 2007). In Eritrea, the population is stable and slowly increasing. However, it is difficult to predict population trends into the future. The desert habitat of the African Wild Ass in both Eritrea and Ethiopia suffers from recurrent and extreme droughts (Kebede 1999; Teclai 2006).",Decreasing,"The African Wild Ass occurs in Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Somalia; some animals may persist in Djibouti, Sudan and Egypt, but there is no recent information available (Moehlman <em>et al.</em> in press). Yalden <em>et al</em>. (1996) recorded them to 1,500 m in Ethiopia.<br/><br/>Two subspecies are recognized. The Nubian Wild Ass, <em>E. a. africanus</em>, lived in the Nubian desert of north-eastern Sudan, from east of the Nile River to the shores of the Red Sea, and south to the Atbara River and into northern Eritrea. During aerial flights in the 1970s, wild asses were seen in the Barka Valley of Eritrea and in the border area between Eritrea and the Sudan. The Somali Wild Ass, <em>E. a. somalicus</em>, was found in the Denkelia region of Eritrea, the Danakil Desert and the Awash River Valley in the Afar region of north-eastern Ethiopia, western Djibouti, and into the Ogaden region of eastern Ethiopia. In Somalia, they ranged from Meit and Erigavo in the north to the Nugaal Valley, and as far south as the Shebele River (Moehlman 2002; Moehlman <em>et al</em>. in press).<br/><br/>The current range of the African Wild Ass (in Ethiopia and Eritrea) is approximately 15,000 km². DNA extracted from faecal samples collected from animals in Eritrea and Ethiopia resulted in the identification of five mitochondrial DNA haplotypes: one haplotype (group of polymorphisms) specific to the Eritrean population (haplotype D); one haplotype specific to the Ethiopian population (E); and three shared haplotypes (A, B, and C). These results suggest that there is and/or has been gene flow between the subpopulations (Afrera, Serdo) in Ethiopia and the population in Eritrea (Oakenfull <em>et al</em>. 2002).",The African Wild Ass is hunted for food and medicinal products. It is only hunted at the subsistence level.,Terrestrial,"Listed on CITES Appendix I. In Ethiopia, the Yangudi-Rassa National Park (4,731 km²) and the Mille-Serdo Wild Ass Reserve (8,766 km²) were established in 1969. However, the former has never been formally gazetted, and both areas are utilized by large numbers of pastoralists and their livestock. These areas are remote and extremely arid, and the Ethiopian Wildlife Conservation Organization (EWCO) has not had sufficient funds or personnel for appropriate management (Kebede 1999). In Eritrea, the government designated the African wild ass area between the Buri Peninsula and the Dalool Depression as a high-priority area for conservation protection as a nature reserve. In both Eritrea and Ethiopia, research and conservation programmes (Ministry of Agriculture and EWCA) have been critical for sustaining African Wild Ass populations by involving local pastoralists in their conservation.

Consequently the species is assessed as Endangered under Criterion D in the Mediterranean region.</p>","Asiatic Wild Ass inhabit mountain steppe, steppe, semi-desert and desert plains. They are usually found in desert steppe. Typically they are grazers and in Mongoia (Gobi B) throughout the year they eat <em>Stipa glareosa</em>, <em>Agropyron cristatum</em> and <em>Achnatherum</em> (<em>Feh</em> 2001). They can be found in rocky or sandy areas associated with <em>Artemisia</em>, grasses, <em>Anabasis</em> spp., Russian thistle (<em>Salsola</em> spp.), saxaul (<em>Haloxylon ammodendron</em>) and pea shrubs (<em>Caragana</em> spp.) (Harris and Miller 1995, Feh <em>et al</em>. 2001). To date, there have been few detailed studies of Asiatic Wild Ass feeding ecology. However, observations suggest a feeding strategy similar to that observed in other equids in xeric environments. When grass is plentiful, Asiatic Wild Ass are predominately grazers. During dry season and in drier habitats, Asiatic Wild Ass will browse a large portion of their diet. While Asiatic Wild Ass eat woody plants, other forage is taken when possible. Animals have been observed eating seed pods (Shah 1993) and using their hooves to break up woody vegetation to obtain more succulent forbs growing at the base of the woody plants. Herds can number up to 1,200 individuals. Water sources are an important determinant of distribution; in summer months the species occurs within 10-15 km of standing water, and this range increases five-fold in winter when it is not restricted by water availability. In Mongolia, Asiatic Wild Ass have been observed digging holes as deep as 60 cm in dry riverbeds to access water, eating snow during winter as a substitute (Feh <em>et al</em>. 2002; Stubbe <em>et al</em>. 2005).<br/><br/>Asiatic Wild Ass weigh approximately 200-260 kg. Gestation is 11 months and breeding is seasonal. Peak birthing season occurs between April and September - within any one subpopulation, births tend to occur over a two to three month span with a peak between mid June and mid July (Feh <em>et al</em> 2002).<br/><br/>There have been a number of studies on social organisation and behavioural ecology of Asiatic asses. These studies have been conducted on several of the Asiatic Wild Ass populations throughout their range. While the explanations and terminology describing the species' mating system do not necessarily coincide, there are similarities in the observations. In all studies, breeding is seasonal and females with young tend to group together in relatively small groups (two to five females). Descriptions of male breeding strategies differ considerably (Feh <em>et al</em> 2002). <br/><br/>Early studies were mostly descriptive. Both Solomatins and Rasheks long term studies based mostly on individual follow-ups described a harem type social structure in Turkmene Kulan harem-style behaviour (Bannikov 1958, Solomatin 1973, Rashek 1973) whereas Klingel's one week observations described a territorial system. Bannikov's short term survey in Mongolia described harems or family groups.  Both harem-style behaviour (Bannikov 1958, Solomatin 1973, Rashek 1973) and territorial defence (Klingel 1977) social systems were described. Since 1980, several detailed studies have been carried out on various subspecies: Khur in the Little Rann of Kutch (Shah 1993), Kulan in Mongolia (Feh <em>et al</em>. 1994, Feh <em>et al</em>. 2001), and the reintroduced Kulan/Onager hybrids in Israel (Saltz and Rubenstein 1995, Saltz <em>et al</em>. 2000). Two studies, Shah (1993) and Saltz <em>et al</em>. (2000), describe systems in which individual stallions either defend territories or form all-male groups. Four social units are identified in Khur; family group, stallion, all male group and displaced stallion (Shah and Qureshi 2007). Stallions in the Rann of Kutch exhibit both seasonal and year-round territoriality with females, forming small seasonal harems (Shah 1993, Shah and Qureshi, 2007). Territorial stallions defend territories throughout the year in the Rann of Kutch. Females remain on territories during the breeding season (monsoon season), with some females remaining on one territory and others moving between territories (Shah 1993, Shah and Qureshi, 2007). A few mares continue to remain on territories all year round. Shah (1993) refers to the two groupings as year-round and seasonal harems. The term ""harem"" maybe misleading here, as the stallion behaviour describes resource defence rather than guarding of females, and the ""item"" at stake is land. Shah (1993) states that ""the quality of the territory seems to be a prime determinant of dominance"". This is similar to territory stallion dominance witnessed in Grévy's zebra (Ginsberg 1989). Within the Rann of Kutch, female movements were often limited to single territories, thereby creating ""harem-like"" female groupings (Shah 1993). However, females are able to move freely between territories, thereby describing a system in which female movement adapts to changing resource availability, as well as mate preference. <em>Khur</em> have territorial harem type social organization (Shah and Qureshi 2007). Rainfall and productivity of food resources  determine the <em>khur</em> recruitment and population growth rate (Shah and Qureshi 2007).<br/><br/>Similar social behaviour has been documented in the reintroduced population of wild asses in the Negev, Israel. The study in Israel is unique in that it has documented a growing population of all known individual females and territorial stallions. The study has followed  the population from having one territorial stallion to more than seven. Males return to the main breeding area (an area with  permanent water sources) each spring, several weeks before the females return (Saltz <em>et al</em>. 2000). The majority of males return to the same territories that they held in previous years; non-territorial males either form small all-male groups in the breeding area or remain in the winter grazing areas. Females return within a few weeks and foal almost immediately. Females form groups on territories but group membership remains fluid. This fission-fusion social system (Rubenstein 1986, Rubenstein <em>et al</em>. 2007) has some females remaining on one territory throughout the breeding season while others switch territories regularly.<br/><br/>In the Gobi B National Park (Mongolia), both Bannikov (1958) and Feh <em>et al</em>. (1994, 2001) suggest that Kulan social behaviour is similar to that of feral horses. Feh <em>et al</em>. (1994, 2001) describe family groups consisting of individual males with several females and their foals moving to and from water sources, but the study is based on only a small number of identified individuals. In addition, stallions were observed to herd females. This behaviour is similar to that found in feral horses (although some of the specific postures differed) and is not common among the other subspecies studied. <em>Khur</em> have territorial harem where stallions defend resources and benefit from having access to mares on these territories (Shah 1993, Shah and Qureshi 2007). In Gobi B, stallions were observed to defend both females and foals from predators (Feh <em>et al</em>. 1994). Feh <em>et al</em>. (1994, 2001) suggest that khulan behaviour in Gobi B is different from other populations as a direct response to predation pressure from cooperatively hunting wolves.<br/><br/>Further study of known individuals is necessary to fully understand the social behaviour of Asiatic wild ass. It is likely that differences in social structure and behaviour depend on climatic seasonality, vegetation cover, and predator hunting pressures. Additional clarification of social structure and the factors that influence animal movement and behaviour (e.g. climatic and anthropogenic factors, grazing pressure, etc.) can provide a helpful tool in understanding threats to individual populations. The studies briefly outlined above demonstrate that there is a great deal of flexibility within the species' social structure. With increasing levels of desertification and habitat fragmentation, all the above and future studies should be consulted in the formation of habitat and species conservation plans Feh <em>et al</em> 2002, Rubenstein <em>et al</em>. 2007).","Threats to the species include loss of habitat as a result of human settlement, cultivation, overgrazing, developmental activities, conflict with humans (crop depredation), competition for water, salt extraction, poaching for meat, competition with domestic livestock and, in certain parts of the range, war and civil unrest have had a detrimental effect on the species (Clark and Duncan 1992; Feh <em>et al</em>. 2002). Perhaps the greatest threat to the populations of Asiatic Wild Ass appears to be the potential for catastrophic population declines due to poaching (i.e., <em>kulan</em> in Turkmenistan and <em>hemionus</em> in Mongolia). Disease and/or drought are ""stress events"" that are a constant threat to small, isolated Wild Ass populations, such as those in India, Iran, Israel, and Turkmenistan. For example, a disease outbreak of African horse sickness in the 1960s resulted in a major decline and the extinction of small Khur populations (Gee 1963). Continued fragmentation and marginalisation of the smaller populations could result in similar extinctions. Small, isolated populations are demographically and genetically vulnerable.<br/><br/>Specific threats to particular populations are outlined below:<br/><br/>The main threats to the Onager (<em>Equus hemionus onager</em>) in Iran are, in decreasing order of severity, poaching, overgrazing, competition for water, and removal of shrubs (Tatin <em>et al</em>. 2001). Tatin <em>et al</em>. (2001) identified the main threats to the Onager population at Touran, and outlined the actions being implemented to combat them. Both the Touran and Bahramgor populations are geographically, and therefore genetically, isolated from each other.<br/><br/>The Khur (<em>Equus hemionus khur</em>) in the Little Rann of Kutch is the subspecies subject to the most direct threat from increasing human activities. The ecology of the Wild Ass Sanctuary, for example, is threatened by a canal building project - the Sardar Sarovar Project of the Narmada Development Authority (Goyal <em>et al</em>. 1999). There is growing competition for resources as an increasing number of livestock are grazed within the reserve during monsoon season. At the same time, salt mining, the major economic industry for local people, has increased 140% since 1958 (Shah 1993). Such increased activity is particularly disruptive as the period for salt mining coincides with advanced stage of pregnancy in the Khur (Shah 1993). The increase in Khur population and its range expansion into the human dominated landscapes has resulted in increased incidences of crop depredation. Agriculture has intensified with better irrigation facilities thus changing the land use patterns.<br/><br/>The Kulan (<em>Equus hemionus kulan</em>) has suffered a catastrophic decline in the late 1990s due to poaching for the sale of meat (Lukarevskii pers. comm. 2001, Feh <em>et al</em> 2002). The only naturally occurring population of this subspecies is in the Badkhyz Reserve in Turkmenistan. During the summer months this population migrates to the Kuska River, which is 100&#160;km outside of the protected area. The critical situation of the Badkhys Reserve Kulans clearly illustrates how swiftly isolated equid populations can be decimated and potentially driven to extinction during a period of a few years.<br/><br/>The Mongolian Kulan (<em>Equus hemionus hemionus</em>) is suffering from illegal hunting for meat and skins, for commercial use in some areas (Duncan 1992; Stubbe <em>et al</em>. 2005, Stubbe <em>et al</em> 2007). Habitat is being degraded through human settlements such as herder camps which restrict access to oases, resource extraction such as mining, and possibly though grazing by increasing numbers of domestic livestock, particularly domestic horses and sheep. Habitat fragmentation and restriction of wide-scale movements due to fencing is a significant problem along the Ulaanbaatar-Beijing railway and the China-Mongolia border (Kaczensky <em>et al</em>. 2006, in prep.), and is also caused by roads, fences and railway lines associated with resource extraction activities. Nomadic herdsmen in Mongolia claim that an increasing number of Kulan are damaging the rangeland (Reading <em>et al</em>. 1997). In part, wildlife-livestock competition may result from an increased number of livestock following Mongolia's shift to a market economy (e.g., livestock  numbers increased from 24.6 million head to 28.6 million head between 1989 and  1995 (Honhold 1995, Müller and Janzen 1997, Reading <em>et al</em>. 2001). The negative impacts of grazing in Mongolia are well documented, especially where wild and domestic livestock overlap (Honhold 1995, Mallon <em>et al</em>. 1997, Reading <em>et al</em>. 2001, Shagdarsuren <em>et al</em>. 1987). Increased competition with livestock may result in further fragmentation of the wild ass population by limiting Kulan to strictly protected areas. In addition to competition for grazing land, poaching for meat and hides poses an increasing threat to Kulan in Mongolia (Duncan 1992, Reading <em>et al</em>. 2001). High levels of hunting in the 1980s severely decreased kulan populations in inner Mongolia. Xiaoming and Schaller (1996) found very few Kulan further than 100&#160;km from the Chinese/Mongolia border, suggesting that the inner Mongolian population is only a seasonal expansion of the Mongolian population. Wingard and Zahler (2006) reported that the illegal trade in Mongolian Kulan is removing approximately 3,000 individuals per year from the population. This level of exploitation is not sustainable.","During the past century the total population and range of Asiatic Wild Ass has declined significantly (Clark and Duncan 1992, Feh <em>et al</em>. 2002).<br/><br/>The largest remaining subspecies population is the Mongolian Khulan (<em>E. h. hemionus</em>) which was estimated in 2003 at 18,411 +/- 898 in four areas (Lkhagvasuren  2007). Southern Mongolia currently holds the largest population of Asiatic Wild Ass in the world, representing almost 80% of the global population (Feh <em>et al</em>. 2002). However, this population is at risk due to illegal hunting and numbers have declined significantly from an estimated population size of 43,165 in 1997 (Feh <em>et al</em>. 2001, Reading <em>et al</em>. 2001). There may be as many as 4,800 to 6,000 Khulan in the Kalameili Reserve in China, but this may be a seasonal population that is migrating from Mongolia (Pantel <em>et al</em> 2006). Offtake for the illegal meat trade is estimated at 3,000 individuals per year. Recruitment (number of offspring) varies from 3-23%. The potential net loss per year may be 5-10%. In 21 years or 3 generations, the population decline will be greater than 50%. If illegal hunting continues in Mongolia, the potential decline of this important population will be 5-10% per year. The Kulan population in Turkmenistan is also at risk due to illegal hunting.<br/><br/>The next largest subpopulation is the Indian Khur (<em>E. h. khur</em>) with an estimated population in 2004 of 3,900 in the Little Rann of Kutch (Shah and Qureshi 2007). This is the only subpopulation of Asiatic Wild Ass that has had a steady increase in population size since 1976 to the present. The population increase is associated with range expansion, <em>khur</em> has occupied areas beyond ~200 km away from its source population in Little Rann of Kutch (Shah and Qureshi 2007). <br/><br/>The Kulan (<em>E. h. kulan</em>) populations in 2005 were approximately 1,300 in Turkmenistan (Badkhys Reserve  850-900 and seven reintroduction sites (445) (Lukarevskiy and Gorelov 2007) The Kulan has experienced a recent dramatic decline in its main population in Turkmenistan. The population in the Badkhyz Preserve declined from 6,000 in 1993, to 2,400 in 1998 to 646 in 2000 (Feh <em>et al</em>. 2002). From 1995 to 2000 the estimated number of Kulan in reintroduction sites was approximately 320. In 1992 the reintroduced populations in Kazakhstan were Barsa-Khelmes Island : 96 ; Aktau-Busatchinski: uncertain; Andasaiski reserve: 164 ; Kaptchagaiskoye: 150 for a total of 410. In 1999, the reintroduced populations in Kazakhstan in these four sites was approximately 900 animals (Pereladova and Baidavletov pers. com. 2006). The reintroduced population in Uzbekistan in Dzheiran Ecocentre was 34 in 1991 (Feh <em>et al</em>. 2002).<br/><br/>Information on the status of the Onager in Iran (<em>E. h. onager</em>) is limited, but recent estimates are 600 in the two protected areas (L. Shamimi, pers.com. 2007). There were 471 animals in Touran National Park in 2000, and 96 in Bahramgor Reserve in 1996, with four re-introduced animals in Yazd Province in 2000 (Feh <em>et al</em>. 2002). There were also five <em>E. h. onager</em> in Taïf (Saudi Arabia) in 2000, and the hybrid <em>E. h. onager</em> x <em>E. h. kulan</em> population in Israel numbered 100 in 2000.<br/><br/>The global population of mature Asiatic Wild Ass has declined by 52% population in the last 16 years. It occurs in 14 locations and is severely fragmented. Generation length in <em>Equus hemionus</em> is seven years, age at first reproduction for females is 5 years, females produce one live foal every three years, sex-ratio at birth is 50/50, first year survival rate is approximately 50%, second year survival rate is approximately 50%, and only half of the stallions reproduce, yielding an approximately one-third of the population being ""mature individuals"" (Feh <em>et al</em> 2001). The current estimated number of mature individuals is 8358. The estimated global population decline in the future is &gt;50% due to illegal hunting.",Stable,"In historic times the Asiatic Wild Ass ranged through much of Mongolia, north to Transbaikalia (Russia), east to northeastern Inner Mongolia (China) and possibly western Manchuria (China), and west to Dzhungarian Gate (Grubb 2005). It formerly occurred in Kazakhstan, north to the upper Irtysh and Ural Rivers in Russia, and westward north of the Caucasus and Black Sea to at least the Dniestr River (Ukraine), Anatolia (Turkey), Syria, and southeast of the Caspian Sea in Iran, northern Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, east to Thar Desert of northwestern India (Grubb 2005). It also extended through the Arabian Peninsula as far south as central Saudi Arabia. It survived in Armenia and Azerbaijan until 17th-18th Centuries (Wolfe 1979). The Syrian Wild Ass became extinct in 1927.<br/><br/>By the 19th Century, their range had declined significantly. Today, the most abundant subpopulation of the species occurs in the southern part of Mongolia and adjacent northern China (Feh <em>et al</em>. 2002). The species also survives as isolated populations in the Rann of Kutch (India), the Badkhyz Preserve (Turkmenistan) and at Touran National Park and Bahramgor Reserve (Iran) (Feh <em>et al</em>. 2002). Populations have been re-established as follows: Barsa-Khelmes Island in the Aral Sea (Kazakhstan); Aktay-Buzachinskiy reserve on the eastern shore of the Caspian Sea (Kazakhstan); Andasayskiy reserve and Kapchagayskoye in southeastern Kazakhstan; Dzheiran Ecocentre near Bukhara (Uzbekistan); Meana-Chaacha, Kaakha, Kopet Dag, and Sumbar Valley in southern Turkmenistan (re-introduced populations in Kurtusu and Germab perhaps no longer survive); Sarakamish Lake in northern Turkmenistan; the Beruchi Peninsula (Ukraine), the Negev (southern Israel), and Taïf (Saudi Arabia) (Feh <em>et al</em>. 2002). The re-established populations in Ukraine, Israel and Saudi Arabia are not of the subspecies that originally occurred there (Feh <em>et al</em>. 2002).<br/><br/>There are five generally recognized subspecies (Grubb 2005):<br/><em>Equus h. hemionus</em> - the Mongolian Kulan (in northern Mongolia) (<em>E. h. luteus</em> - the Gobi Kulan in southern Mongolia and northern China, is probably a synonym of <em>E. h. hemionus</em> (Oakenfull <em>et al</em>. 2000, Grubb 2005))<br/><em>E. h. khur</em> - the Khur (India)<br/><em>E. h. kulan</em> the Turkmen Kulan (in Turkmenistan, re-introduced in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Ukraine)<br/><em>E. h. onager</em> - the Onager (Iran, introduced in Saudi Arabia)<br/><em>E. h. hemippus</em> - the Syrian Wild Ass (Extinct, formerly from Syria south into the Arabian Peninsula)<br/>The reintroduced population in Israel is of hybrid origin (<em>E. h. onager</em> and <em>E. h. kulan</em>).<br/><br/>The largest surviving subpopulation, the Mongolian Kulan (<em>Equus h. hemionus</em>)  is in Mongolia, where it was formerly widely distributed throughout steppe and semi-desert habitats, from the extreme west of the country to the Mongolian-Russian-Chinese border in the extreme northeast (Feh <em>et al</em>. 2002, Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006). The Asiatic Wild Ass has experienced a major decline in population size and range size, even in Mongolia (Bannikov 1981) and they are now only found in the Trans Altai Gobi Desert, the Northern Gobi, the Alashani Gobi Desert and the Dzungarian Gobi Desert (Reading <em>et al</em>. 2001, Feh <em>et al</em>. 2002), as far north as Ikh Nartiin Chuluu Nature Reserve in the Eastern Gobi (S. Amgalanbaatar and R. Reading pers. obs.). Recent evidence suggests that the population has either expanded or shifted further north and east over the past 20-25 years, but rarely crosses the Ulaanbaatar-Beijing railway line (Kaczensky <em>et al</em>. in prep.). There are important populations in the Great Gobi Section B Strictly Protected Area, in Dzungarian Gobi, and the Great Gobi Section A Strictly Protected Area in Trans Altai Govi Desert (Feh <em>et al</em>. 2002, Stubbe <em>et al</em>. 2005, Kaczensky <em>et al</em>. in prep.).<br/><br/>The Khur <em>Equus hemionus khur</em> was formerly widespread in the arid zone of northwestern India and Pakistan, westwards through much of central Asia. However, it is now limited to the Little Rann of Kutch  in Gujarat, India. The khur probably went extinct in Baluchistan and the extreme south of Pakistan, on the Indian border, during the 1960s (Corbet and Hill 1992). There are some recent records of Khur along India-Pakistan border. During the last two decades Khur has shown range expansion along with an increase in their population (Shah 2004).",,Terrestrial,"This species is legally protected in Mongolia, Turkmenistan, Iran and India. In Mongolia it is protected as Rare under the 2001 revision (Mongolian Government Act No. 264) of the 2000 Law of the Mongolian Animal Kingdom (MNE 1996). Hunting has been prohibited since 1953, and it is currently listed as Rare under the 1995 Mongolian Hunting Law (MNE 1996). It is listed as Rare in both the 1987 and 1997 Mongolian Red Books (Shagdarsuren <em>et al</em>. 1987; MNE 1997). <em>Equus hemionus hemionus</em> and <em>E. h. khur</em> are included in CITES Appendix I, with the other subspecies being on CITES Appendix II. The species is included in Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). The species occurs in protected areas in all range states where it survives. Approximately 29% of the species' range in Mongolia occurs within protected areas (Clark <em>et al</em> 2006).<br/><br/>As outlined in the section on geographic distribution, there have been re-introduction projects for this species in a number of countries, including Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Iran, Ukraine, Israel and Saudi Arabia. In an effort to increase the total number of kulan populations, animals from the Badkhys and Barsa Kelmes were translocated to other areas in Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and Uzbzekistan between 1955 and 1991 (Feh <em>et al</em>. 2002).  Recognizing the threatened status of the dwindling Kulan population in the 1940s, the Soviet government gazetted the 900 km² Badkhyz Preserve in Turkmenistan to protect the remaining 200 Kulan. The population consequently grew to approximately 6,000 animals between 1945 and 1993. However, in the late 1990s when the Kulans left  the reserve during the summer months, they were killed in large numbers. The population was significantly reduced to approximately 600 animals. This history illustrates how quickly a healthy population of equids can be reduced to a critically endangered level. <br/><br/>To date, the introduction of <em>E. hemionus</em> in Israel has been successful. The animals were introduced in 1982. Due to a high percentage of male births, the population grew very slowly at first (Saltz and Rubenstein 1996). Starting in 1991, the population began to grow more quickly with 17 births in 1994. As of the 1997 birth season, there were approximately 105 animals, of which 31 were adult breeding females. The animals are found over an area of 4,500 km². The animals use three artificial water points that are maintained by the Israeli Nature Reserves Authority in addition to several natural  springs. Detailed ongoing studies of the population examine population increase, range expansion, habitat use, and changes in vegetation density and species richness. Information from these studies will be used in the development of management plans for the population (Feh <em>et al</em> 2002).<br/><br/>There are some important research needs for this species. A large omission in our knowledge of the Asiatic Wild Ass is its status and distribution within China. In Turkmenistan and Iran, the management of the Onager and Kulan would greatly benefit from increased knowledge of basic behaviour and ecology. Such information would provide a better understanding of threats to these populations. In particular, as the potential for escalating human-wildlife conflict increases during droughts, a short-term study to understand the seasonal movement patterns of the Badkhyz Kulan population in Turkmenistan, and the places where conflicts are taking place, might help to address how best to protect this population. <br/><br/>In Mongolia, the following conservation measures are in place:<br/>- In 1999, the Mongolian Government created two protected areas specifically for the conservation of this species, Great Gobi Section B Strictly Protected Area (Dzungarian Gobi Desert) and Zagiin Us Nature Reserve (Northern Gobi) (Feh <em>et al</em>. 2002).<br/>- Research projects have been conducted to investigate the status, distribution, ecology and social structure of Asiatic Wild Ass in Mongolia (e.g., Feh <em>et al</em>., 2001; Reading <em>et al</em>. 2001).<br/>- Several conservation organizations were brought together at the ""First Asiatic Wild Ass Conference"" held in Mongolia in 2005 (AWAC 2005), where a range of conservation management issues were addressed.<br/>- An in-depth study of the ecological impact of the Ulaanbaatar-Beijing railway has been conducted, including trials using Mongolian Gazelles to investigate the possibility of their crossing bridges or tunnels. This research may also benefit Asiatic Wild Ass migration.<br/>- Activities in Great Gobi Section B Strictly Protected Area include: monthly wildlife transects, monitoring of Asiatic Wild Ass and other species such as wolves (<em>Canis lupus</em>) and Przewalski's Horse (<em>Equus ferus przewalskii</em>) to understand interactions, vegetation mapping, and workshops to integrate park management with sustainable livelihoods (Kaczensky <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/> <br/>The following five actions are now those deemed most important for this species (Feh <em>et al</em> 2002):<br/><br/>1. The Kulan population in Badkhys Preserve has declined by approximately 90% in a three year period. Improved protection from poaching is needed both within the reserve and along the summer migration route to the Kushka River. The ecological requirements of this population need to be determined and an ecosystem analysis made of their habitat in order to prepare a long-term sustainable management plan.<br/><br/>2. Over 30% of the Khur population is ranging outside the Protected Area. The Sardar Sarovar Canal has changed the land-use patterns and the agro-economy i.e. from rain dependent crops to irrigated cash crops. Around the Rann, mitigation measures for the increasing number of wildlife and human conflicts are urgently needed. <em>Prosopis juliflora</em>, is an exotic shrub spreading fast across the habitat, the management needs to undertake thinning operation of this shrub for habitat improvement. Salt mining is the major economy for eight months in the year for the locals living around the Rann. This area produces 21% of India's salt. The transportation of the salt is through well-defined routes. Presently truckers criss-cross through the area (habitat) thereby causing excessive damage to fragile arid grasslands (Shah 1993). The Sardar Sarovar canal has fragmented the Khur population. There is a need to evaluate possible linkages between the fragmented Khur population and its source Rann population. There is a need to understand the demography and immigration patterns of Khur in the newly occupied sites (i.e., Nal Sarovar Bird Sanctuary, Velavadar Blackbuck National Park, areas in Bhal, Great Rann and neigbouring state of Rajasthan) (Shah 1993, 1998, 1999). The existing sanctuary infrastructure and staffing needs to be strengthened which is presently inadequate for managing a Sanctuary of 5,000 km² (Shah 1993). There is a need for disease monitoring of domestic equids and other livestock.  The sanctuary was notified in 1973, and the land settlement process has been initiated. The sanctuary has been identified as a potential Natural World Heritage Site; its evaluation is pending (Gujarat Forest Department 2007). There is a need for an assessment of the status of Khur along the Indo-Pakistan border adjoining the Rann. The Wild Ass Sanctuary was identified as one of the six landscape sites in India for biodiversity conservation through improved rural livelihoods, a programme which is aided by the World Bank (Government of India 2007).<br/><br/>3. Taxonomic questions need to be clarified and subspecies ranges should be demarcated. These data are needed for the Wild Ass subspecies in Mongolia and for the Kulan/Onager populations in Turkmenistan and Iran. Information from the latter investigation could also affect the taxonomic listing of the introduced Israeli population.<br/><br/>4. Investigation and development of plans are needed to address conflict between local human groups and Wild Ass populations. Today, grazing outside reserves and encroachment into agricultural areas threaten to decrease ""good-will"" towards Asiatic Wild Ass populations in Turkmenistan and Mongolia. Whether now or in the future, all Wild Ass populations will probably be in conflict with local pastoralists and agricultural groups. Conflict with human populations will lead to loss of habitat quality and increased susceptibility to high mortality during drought and disease outbreaks. Efforts need to be made to address current problems and to limit their occurrence in the future. In addition, the following conservation measures have been identified specifically for Mongolia (AWAC 2005):<br/><br/>- Enhance enforcement of existing protective legislature, including strict control at border posts between Mongolia and China for illegal export of carcasses.<br/>- Control meat markets, to prevent illegal trade in carcasses within Mongolia.<br/>- Map critical habitat and movement corridors.<br/>- Consider migration routes when planning transportation routes and fences, including implementation of mitigation measures along fenced transportation routes (e.g., railway Ulaanbaatar-Beijing) (P. Kaczensky pers. comm.).<br/>- Raise public awareness and establish education programmes to highlight the international importance and socioeconomic benefits of Mongolian populations (e.g., teach herders that they benefit from Asiatic Wild Ass digging waterholes in dry riverbeds) (C. Feh pers. comm.).<br/>- Livelihood aid for local people, e.g., alternative income strategies. Conflict between local pastoralists and agricultural groups needs to  be addressed.<br/>- Conduct further research on population numbers, habitat use and migration, including further research to clarify the subspecific taxonomy of Mongolian populations of Asiatic Wild Ass (Feh <em>et al</em>. 2002), and rigorous annual population monitoring, preferentially using aerial surveys.<br/>- Stronger co-operation between Mongolia and China to facilitate conservation efforts, e.g. formation of trans-border protected areas.",Palearctic,,false,false,Mediterranean
14164772,1794,Aonyx congicus,Near Threatened,,2015,2014-01-17 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"All Africa's otter species are threatened by alteration or degradation of freshwater habitats and riparian vegetation which are the preferred settlements of human population. Congo Clawless Otters have been protected by the remoteness of the Congo forest and the difficulty of catching them. However, firearms are growing in prevalence in the region, providing a possible 10-fold increase in hunters’ success rate over traditional practices (Levi <em>et al</em>. 2009). Road-building opening up the forest for timber exploitation and construction of large hydroelectric projects could also reduce the protection afforded to date.<br/><br/>Habitat loss by direct causes (clearing, inundation) and indirect causes (pollution, invasive species introduction) and competition for fisheries is increasing with the growing human population in concert with declining returns from an unsustainable bushmeat trade (Wilkie <em>et al</em>. 2005). These combined factors predict a severe reduction of otter habitat and populations. Increased global temperature and resultant climate change may also increase periods of drought, with additional losses to otter populations (Davenport <em>et al</em>. 2011). Consequently, all African otter species are likely to be more affected in the next 20 years (generation length 6.5 as proposed by Pacifici <em>et al</em>. 2013). Thus the species isassessed as Near Threatened based on a suspected 25% decline over the next three generations due to the expected decline in habitat quality and other threats to the species. It almost qualifies as threatened under criterion A3cde; this is a precautionary listing.","<p>The Congo Clawless Otter occurs in rain forests and lowland swamps of the Congo River basin (Lariviere 2001, Jacques <em>et al.</em> 2009). They are observed in swampy forest clearings (bais), for example, at Langoué Bai in Gabon, and Mbeli Bai in Nouabalé-Ndoki National Park (N.P.) and in Odzala N.P. in the Republic of the Congo (Jacques <em>et al</em>. 2009). They also inhabit some rivers, for example Dji Dji River (Gabon) (Davenport <em>et al</em>. 2011), and Sanaga River (Cameroon) (Jacques 2006). They are recorded up to 2,200 m on the Kahuzi Massif (Rahm and Christiaensen 1963). With one exception (Davenport <em>et al</em>. 2011), all records report the presence of only one young with the mother (Jacques 2002b).</p>","<em>Aonyx congicus</em> may not be under threat where the forest is still well preserved&#160; (Gabon and parts of Congo). Nevertheless, road opening for wood exploitation could adversely affect the sustainable use of the forest with hunters using these roads for their illegal activities. Deforestation has dramatically increased in Cameroon and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and will probably be an even bigger problem in future. As a result of the high human density, lakes and rivers are subjected to pollutants from human activities such as washing, agricultural run-off and soil erosion.<br/><br/>Overfishing has become a critical threat to otter populations as fish community structure has been decimated across the central Congo Basin. Fishes contribute from 23 to 50 per cent of the animal protein trade in Central Africa (<a href=""http://www.fao.org/docrep/t6800e/t6800e03.htm"">http://www.fao.org/docrep/t6800e/t6800e03.htm</a>) and studies of morphometric measurements have documented the evidence of widespread overfishing for human consumption.<br/><br/>In addition to escalation of hunting for bushmeat and skins, habitat loss and degradation, and overfishing, otter populations in Central Africa are also susceptible to pressure from the development of hydro-electric power projects, under-representation of otter habitat in Protected Areas, fishermen using nylon fishing nets, a growing prevalence of arms and munitions, as well as a dramatic decline in other species (such as the Common Hippopotamus) that contribute to the aquatic-ecosystem functioning and which support otter food supplies. Some of these threats are major, but more important is the dramatic combined effect of threats on the otters.<br/><br/>The Congo Clawless Otter seems to average one pup in a litter and may abandon any area of occupancy with high human activity.&#160; In one study on the Dji Dji River in Gabon (Davenport <em>et al.</em> 2011), reproductive Congo Clawless Otters disappeared from a site previously observed to harbour high densities of the species (alongside <em>Hydrictis maculicollis</em> which did decline to the same degree). Low rainfall in the previous wet season was thought to be the reason, but nothing is known about the adaptability of otters, their seasonal movements or the whereabouts of Congo Clawless Otters in response to drought conditions. As global climate change is predicted to increase the frequency and severity of droughts, these conditions may impact survival and reproduction of the species in the future.<br/><p></p>","<p>This is a very poorly known species. It may be common in certain undisturbed rainforest locations, but is otherwise thought to be rare to very rare (Jacques <em>et al. </em>2009). In certain places, locals attest that they see fewer “big otters” (<em>A. congicus</em> versus <em>H</em><em>. maculicollis</em>) (Jacques 2002b,c; Jacques <em>et al</em>. 2002a; Jacques 2003, 2006; Davenport <em>et al</em>. 2011). A number of documented cases of <em>A. congicus</em> (including mother and cub) being killed by locals in Cameroon, Gabon, Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo would suggest that although otters are rarely seen and are difficult to catch, otter populations may suffer from hunting pressure in Congo Basin (Jacques 2002b). This will likely increase in the future as human population grows and preferred bushmeat species become scarce.</p>",Decreasing,"The Congo Clawless Otter occurs in the rainforests of the Congo basin including Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Republic of Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as well as southern Cameroon, southern Central African Republic, northern Angola, and extending eastward to the forests and the wetlands of Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda (Rowe-Rowe 1990, Larivière 2001, Jacques <em>et al.</em> 2009). The limits of the species’ distribution range are still unclear, partly due to the species’ possible confusion with the Cape Clawless Otter; there are, as yet, no confirmed records from Nigeria (Jacques <em>et al</em>. 2009).","Otters are occasionally hunted for meat, but have the reputation of being quite difficult to catch. They are seldom recorded in bushmeat reports (S. Lahm and A.Willox pers. comms., Jacques 2002b). The price is quite similar to other bushmeat. While meat is sought after in Congo and Cameroon, this is not the case in Gabon.<br/><br/>Moreover, in Gabon, otters are sometimes considered dangerous, giving an electrical shock when caught with a spear. In Central and West Africa, their meat has the reputation of being an aphrodisiac (as it is with many other species). In some areas, the otter is said to possess magical powers: by wearing a piece of fur one can become invisible to an opponent, or escape an enemy as otters escape fish traps.<br/><br/>In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), killing has exponentially increased over the recent decade with the proliferation of weapons and munitions, making the shooting of otters from pirogues and the river bank much more common (Thompson pers. comm.). Skins of <em>A. congicus </em>are used in Cameroon to make drums (Alary <em>et al</em>. 2001).

Such assessment will require a better understanding of population structure so that population-specific abundance, non-natural mortality rates and other relevant parameters can be estimated and considered. <span lang=""EN-US"">Due to a lack of good data on these parameters, <em>Sotalia fluviatilis </em>is listed as Data Deficient. </span></p>","<p><span lang=""EN-US"">Tucuxis inhabit all three types of water of the Amazon basin: white water, clear water, and black water. Therefore, physical factors such as visibility and acidity appear not to affect their distribution directly.&#160; They seem to prefer the main channels of rivers and larger lakes where access is not limited by a narrow or shallow channel, while rapids and fast-moving turbulent water are avoided. Tucuxis also generally do not enter the flooded forest. They are mostly found within 50 m of the edges of rivers and channels (Martin <em>et al.</em> 2004). Similarly to the sympatric Boto, the Tucuxi shows a distinct preference for junctions of rivers and channels (da Silva and Best 1996, Leatherwood <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2000, Martin <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2004). The most preferred habitat is where a sediment-rich whitewater channel meets the low pH- carrying black water. The resultant mixing produces productive and obviously attractive conditions for dolphins (Martin <em>et al.</em> 2004). The large seasonal fluctuation in river levels (10m) influences the distribution of Tucuxis. They enter lake systems during periods of high water but leave these environments as the waters recede, thus avoiding entrapment. In the Peruvian Amazon, Tucuxis were not found in waters &lt;3m depth in rivers or &lt;1.8 m depth in lakes. </p>  <p>Individuals may occur in the same area year-round. Two tagged individuals in the Amazon were found within 5 km of the tagging site up to 1 year later (da Silva and Best 1994). A long-term photo-identification study revealed a maximum range for individuals of 130 km in Peru's Pacaya-Samiria Reserve (McGuire and Henningsen 2007). This relatively small range is probably due to limiting features such as small channels and seasonally shallow waters. According to McGuire (2002), encounter rates were highest in confluences, intermediate in lakes, and lowest in rivers and did not differ among seasons in the latter two. During the dry season, Tucuxis persisted longer in the confluences and occurred in higher densities than in any rainy or intermediate season; the reverse pattern was observed during high water.&#160; </p>  <p><em>Sotalia fluviatilis</em> occurs most often in groups of one to six individuals. Groups of more than nine animals are rarely observed (da Silva and Best 1994, Faustino and da Silva 2006). The composition of groups is unknown. Vidal <em>et al.</em> (1997) reported overall mean group size of 3.9 in the upper Amazon. Tucuxis were most frequently seen as singles or pairs in rivers and lakes of Peru's Pacaya-Samiria Reserve; seasonal differences in group size were non-significant (McGuire 2002). </p>  <p>Information on reproduction is sparse. Males attain sexual maturity at approximately 140cm and females at between 132 and 137cm (da Silva and Best 1996). In Brazil, gestation lasts about 11 months and calves are about 80 cm long at birth, which occurs primarily from September to November during the low-water period (da Silva and Best 1996, Flores and da Silva 2009). Neonate Tucuxi were observed in all seasons in the Peruvian Amazon, with a slight peak in encounter rates during high water (McGuire and Aliaga 2007).</p>  <p>At least 28 species of <span lang=""EN-US"">mostly small schooling fish belonging to 11 families are preyed upon by tucuxis in the Amazon region. The characoid family Curimatidae was represented in 52%, Sciaenidae in 39% and siluriforms in 54% of stomachs analysed (n = 29) (da Silva and Best 1994). During the dry season, fish concentrate in the main water bodies and thus are more vulnerable to predation. During the flood season, many species enter the floodplain and are largely out of reach of Tucuxis.</span></p>","<span lang=""EN-US"">There are no records of past or recent commercial fisheries for <em>Sotalia</em> spp. (IWC 2001). River dolphins in the Amazon region are threatened primarily by incidental mortality in fishing gear (IWC 2001). <em>Sotalia fluviatilis</em> consumes 14 of the 30 species of commercially exploited fish in the Amazon, and thus incidental captures during fishing are frequent (da Silva and Best 1994, 1996; Martin <em>et al.</em> 2004). In one study in the central Amazon of Brazil, 74% of 34 Tucuxis examined had been killed in gill nets and 15% in seine nets (da Silva and Best 1985). By-catch in fishing gear, caused by the proliferation of gill nets, and some evidence of poisoning by commercial fishermen, seem to be the main conservation threats to Tucuxis in Peru (Reeves <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 1999).<span lang=""EN-US""><br/><br/>Other potentially important threats are oil spills, boat strikes, chemical and noise pollution, overfishing of prey, and damming of rivers for hydroelectric projects (da Silva and Best 1994, Denkinger 2001, McGuire 2002). Dams can interrupt gene flow and create isolated groups of dolphins with reduced genetic variability and lowered demographic resilience. <span lang=""EN-US"">The use of pesticides banned in many countries continues to be common in some parts of South America (PNUMA 2002). Mercury is used to refine fluvial gold and then, like the pesticides, enters aquatic food webs. Dams, in addition to fragmenting dolphin populations, can have serious effects on migratory fish populations on which Tucuxis feed (such as some siluriform fishes) (da Silva and Best 1994). The increased use of outboard engines and illegal fishing with explosives are also sources of concern in parts of these dolphins' range (e.g. Utreras <em>et al.</em> 2001, Zapata-Rios and Utreras 2004).<span lang=""EN-US""><br/><br/>Although freshwater dolphins have been protected by superstitions in parts of Amazonia (Leatherwood and Reeves 1997), in Colombia and Brazil there was and may still be a small market for the eyes, teeth and reproductive organs of dolphins, used as love charms or aphrodisiacs when prepared in a special manner (da Silva and Best 1994, 1996; Trujillo and Diazgranados 2002; Alves and Rosa 2008). According to V. da Silva (pers. comm.), this market is no longer a significant threat in the Brazilian Amazon, although according to M. Borobia (in IWC 2007) the practice of selling dolphin parts continues in at least some local areas. However, according to V. Da Silva (pers. comm.), fishermen in the central Amazon do not kill Tucuxi deliberately or use parts of its body as love charm. Teeth, eyes and body parts are from <em>S. guianensis</em>, most captured accidentally in the Para coast. Eyes of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">S. guianensis</span>, killed in the nets at the Amazon estuary are often sold in the markets as Boto eyes. Recent molecular analyses have shown that a high proportion of dolphin products sold as amulets and love charms are derived from Guiana dolphins (<em>S. guianensis</em>), even in the Amazon region (Cunha and Solé- Cava 2007, Gravena <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008, Sholl <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008).<span lang=""EN-US""><br/><br/>Recently, Loch <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> (2009) found two Tucuxis and one Boto wounded by perforating and cutting objects, probably harpoons and machetes. Such kills indicate potential conflicts with locals using tucuxi and boto as bait in a catfish fishery (V. da Silva, pers. comm.). Trujillo and Diazgranados (2002) reported one death by harpooning in the Colombian Amazon, in a ten-year monitoring period.</span></span>","To date, there is no information on the population structure of <em>S. fluviatilis</em>. The only data available suggest that the species has moderate to high genetic diversity, since 12 individuals from the same location in the central Brazilian Amazon had five different control region haplotypes (Cunha <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2005), and 21 dolphins from the Peruvian, Colombian and Brazilian Amazon had 13 haplotypes (combining the control region and ND2, Caballero <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2007). Microsatellite variation is also larger in <em>S. fluviatilis </em>(H = 0.531) than in <em>S. guianensis </em>(H = 0.364; Cunha and Watts 2007). The reason for a higher level of genetic variation in <em>S. fluviatilis</em>, in spite of its probably smaller population size, remains to be determined. <span lang=""EN-US"">There are no estimates of the total population size for <em>S. fluviatilis</em>, though it appears to be relatively abundant throughout most of its range (Flores and da Silva 2009). Local estimates of relative abundance exist for some areas. <span lang=""EN-US"">In the Amazon drainage, an average density (encounter rate) of approximately 1.1 dolphins/km of river was estimated between Manaus and Tefé in the Solimões River (Magnusson <em>et al.</em> 1980). Four boat surveys of about 1,525 km each, from Manaus to Letícia, resulted in a mean estimate of 768 (± 104.7 SD) dolphins per trip or 1.02 individuals/km² (da Silva and Best 1994). More recently, mean density along the margins of main rivers in the central Amazon,  Brazil (1,320 km of strip survey) was estimated at 3.2 individuals/km². About 54% of the individuals were found within 50 m of the edge of rivers and channels (Martin <em>et al.</em> 2004). Faustino and da Silva (2006) recorded on average 24 Tucuxis/km in the Mamirauá System, Central Amazon. Higher densities were found in deeper channels with high turbulence and productivity.<span lang=""EN-US""><br/><br/>About 350 Tucuxis were estimated to inhabit the Samiria River system in Peru (Leatherwood 1996). Recent studies indicate that encounter rates in this area were within the range for these dolphins elsewhere in South America and that population numbers were stable over 10 years between 1991 and 2000 (McGuire 2002). Mean encounter rates in the Peruvian Amazon were 0.01-080 individuals/km in rivers and 0.05-2.17 individuals/km² in lakes (28 surveys over a four-year time period; McGuire 2002). The species is reportedly common in Colombia in the Loretoyacu River, in the Tarapoto River and in the El Correo Lake system (da Silva and Best 1994). Vidal <em>et al.</em> (1997) estimated that in 1993 there were 409 Tucuxis (CV=13%) along 120 km of the Amazon River bordering Colombia, Peru, and Brazil. Density (dolphins/km²) was highest in lakes (8.6), followed by areas along main banks (2.8) and around islands (2.0)<span lang=""EN-US"">. Those estimates of density or abundance in small portions of the range are of limited use for assessment of the conservation status of the species as a whole. </span></span>",Unknown,"<p><span lang=""EN-US"">Tucuxis are found in the Amazon drainage as far inland as southern Peru, eastern Ecuador, and southeastern Colombia. They occur in the main tributaries of the Amazon/Solimões River basin and they cross international boundaries in areas such as Leticia, between Brazil and Colombia. The species does not occur in the Beni/Mamoré river basin in Bolivia nor in the upper Rio Negro. Its putative presence in the Orinoco is controversial because of a stretch of rapids and waterfalls that are suspected to block the species movements to this area (Flores and da Silva 2009). <span lang=""EN-US"">During the flood season, Tucuxis may move into smaller tributaries, but apparently they do not move into the inundated forest to feed (as botos, <em>Inia geoffrensis</em>, often do), staying mainly in the main river channels, tributaries and lakes (da Silva and Best 1996). Tucuxis are largely sympatric with the Boto in the Amazon and Orinoco systems but generally do not interact with that species.</span></p><p><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US"">The map shows where the species may occur.

They spend most of their time in the canopy, sometimes use the middle and lower strata but are rarely seen in the understory. They are highly frugivorous and feed largely on ripe fleshy fruits, which comprise approximately 80% of their diet and that are mainly found in the emergent trees and upper parts of the forest canopy (Van Roosmalen and Klein 1988, Di Fiore <em>et al.</em> 2008, Link <em>et al.</em> 2012). They complement their diet with young leaves and flowers (especially at times of fruit shortage), with immature seeds, floral buds, aerial roots, and decaying wood (Di Fiore <em>et al.</em> 2008). They play a significant role as seed dispersers as they disperse large quantities of seeds from numerous canopy tree and liana species (van Roosmalen 1985, Link and Di Fiore 2006). Studies on brown spider monkeys at Las Quinchas revealed that they largely depend on ripe fruits, spending over 90% of their foraging time feeding on them (Link <em>et al.</em> 2012). Nonetheless, some populations living in fragmented areas include large quantities of young leaves in their diet (app. 40%) all year-round (Link <em>et al.</em> unpubl. data).<br/><br/>Spider monkeys live in multi-male/multi-female groups of approximately 30 individuals (range 15–60) (for review see Shimooka <em>et al.</em> 2008). However, they are rarely seen all together and are most of the time travelling, feeding and resting in small groups of varying size and composition (Symington 1990). Thus, spider monkeys have a high degree of fission fusion dynamic (Aureli <em>et al.</em> 2008). Although, spider monkeys can have home ranges as large as 400 ha (Link and Di Fiore 2013), home ranges of brown spider monkeys, in the heavily fragmented landscape at San Juan de Carare, were estimated to reach only 30-120 ha. Most probably, home ranges of groups living in continuous forests will be larger. <br/><br/> Although some populations of spider monkeys seem to have most of their births in certain months of the year (May–December for white-bellied spider monkeys at TBS, Ecuador), there is no information on birth seasonality for brown spider monkeys. Female spider monkeys disperse from their natal groups (Di Fiore <em>et al.</em> 2009) at approximately 6 years and reach sexual maturity at approximately 8–9 years of age. They give birth to single offspring after a long gestation period of 226-232 days, with average inter-birth intervals of 32-36 months.<br/><br/>Congdon (1996) provided a brief remark on the behaviour of these monkeys at the Reserva Forestal Caparo, and Duque (2007) provided a list of potential feeding trees for <em>Ateles hybridus hybridus</em> in the El Ávila National Park (however, this primate species was not observed at the time of Duque´s survey). Late maturation and long inter-birth intervals make it difficult for them to recover from hunting and other threats.<br/> <br/> Size<br/> Adult male weight: 6.5-8.5 kg (mean 7.5 kg, N=3) (Link unpubl. data)<br/> Adult female weight: not available.</p>","In Colombia and Venezuela, <em>Ateles hybridus </em>is subject to pervasive habitat loss and to hunting (Link <em>et al.</em> 2013). In Colombia the habitat of <em>A. hybridus </em>is extremely fragmented, and currently less than 20% of the historical distribution remains (Link <em>et al.</em> 2013). There may be a few populations of adequate size to be viable in the mid- to long-term (Defler <em>et al.</em> 2003). Large and continuous forests only remain at Serranía de San Lucas, Serranía del Perijá, Catatumbo and Serranía de Las Quinchas, but a large proportion of forest fragments within their range is too small to hold viable populations. Also, in areas with large continuous forests, brown spider monkeys are heavily hunted for subsistence and for medicinal use, driving their populations to local extinction.<br/><br/>Habitat alteration appears to be the most important threat to the Venezuelan population of <em>A. hybridus</em>. The lowland forest of the state of Zulia and the piedmont of the Perijá Mountains are heavily destroyed by expanding cattle ranching activities (B. Urbani unpubl. data). Portillo and Velásquez (2006) undertook a gap analysis for this primate species within the Perijá Mountains and found that the remaining total forest area is still sufficiently large (813,257 ha), but only 30% is relatively well protected. The rest is affected by rapid human expansion and land clearance. Also, in the Perijá Mountains, these monkeys seem to be a favourite game species (Lizarralde 2002). In central Venezuela, some areas that were reported to harbour these primates (Cordero-Rodríguez and Biord 2001) were resurveyed by Duque (2007) without reporting any sightings. This is probably because most of the area is already converted into secondary vegetation. Also in this region, B. Urbani (unpubl. data) found that buffer areas around the protected areas—with confirmed populations of <em>Ateles hybridus hybridus</em> (P. N. Guatopo) and unconfirmed populations (M. N. Cueva Alfredo Jahn, P. N. Henry Pittier, P. N. San Esteban and P. N. El Ávila)—are transformed into cleared areas for slash-and-burn agriculture, human settlements or secondary forests. The lowland forests in the eastern part of the Andean Mountains (San Camilo and Ticoporo) are under severe pressure from logging.","<p>In Colombia, the early studies of Bernstein <em>et al.</em> (1976a) estimated a density of 9-14 individuals/km² for <em>Ateles hybridus</em> in the northern range of the San Lucas Mountains. In the same region, specifically at Cerro Bran, Green (1978) estimated densities of 8.2-9.6 groups/km², which, if multiplied by his average group size (3.3 individuals), provide higher population densities. Since 2007 several studies were conducted aiming to estimate population densities of brown spider monkeys in the wild (see Table 1 in the Supplementary Information). Population densities vary from absent to 67 individuals/km².<br/><br/>A population reduction of 80% or more over a period of 45 years or three generations is suspected for the current generation (2018-2033) and two subsequent generations (2033-2063). This reduction will likely be due in part to the loss of suitable habitat, calculated from Global Forest Watch data to be between 20-30% in those regions of Colombia and Venezuela in which this species occurs.&#160; In addition, and perhaps more importantly, this species is very heavily hunted for its meat, as well as for the pet trade.

An isolated population occurs in north-eastern Venezuela in the Parque Nacional Guatopo. <br/><br/><span lang=""en-US"">In Colombia, wild populations are found on the western bank of the Magdalena River in the departments of Bolívar, Antioquia and Caldas, with most populations living in lowland forests (below 1,000 m asl.), but some recent records were reported from higher altitudes (1,780 m asl, Roncancio-Duque 2012). They are also found on the eastern bank of the Magdalena River in the departments of Magdalena and César (north of the southern slopes of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta), in the south-western parts of Guajira on the western and eastern slopes of the Serranía de Perijá, and in the middle Río Magdalena valley reaching the departments of Boyacá and Cundinamarca. West of the eastern Andes they are found in the Río Catatumbo watershed in the department of Norte de Santander and in the north-east piedmont forest of the department of Arauca (Hernández-Camacho and Cooper 1976; Defler 2003, 2004). Brown spider monkeys have a disrupted distribution in Venezuela (Mondolfi and Eisenberg 1979). They are found in the north, along the south-eastern part of the Central Mountain Range (Cordillera de la Costa) in the state of Miranda, and probably in the state of Vargas. They are also located on both sides of the Venezuelan Andean Mountains (states of Zulia, Táchira, Mérida, Trujillo, Portuguesa, Apure and Barinas). In the eastern part of its range, <span lang=""en-US""><em>Ateles hybridus</em><span lang=""en-US""> occurs in the piedmont forest and in the highly threatened lowland forests of San Camilo and Ticoporo. In the West, it also occurs from the piedmont of the Andes throughout the lowland areas around the southern part of Lake Maracaibo to the Perijá Mountains (Sierra de Perijá) along the border with Colombia (Bodini and Pérez-Hernández 1987; Linares 1998; Cordero-Rodríguez and Biord 2001; Portillo and Velásquez 2006; Duque 2007; B.

It is found at:&#160;[1] Catatumbo-Bari National Natural Reserve (158,125 ha): there might be a large population (given the forest cover and habitat types protected within the National Park), but there is almost no information on their population size.&#160;[2] Tamá National Natural Park (48,000 ha): no recent records.&#160;[3] El Cocuy National Natural Park (306,000 ha) and Parque Nacional Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta (383,000 ha): only small areas of these two parks may still harbor populations of brown spider monkeys, however this needs to be confirmed.&#160;[4] Selva de Florencia: there are some recent records of browns spider monkeys (Roncancio et al. 2012), but population densities seem to be extremely low.In summary, there is a complete lack of information on the current status and potential viability of wild brown spider monkeys that live within the National Parks of Colombia.&#160;In Venezuela, the species occurs in the Guatopo National Park (92,640 ha), which is of particular importance because it is one of the major water reservoirs for the capital city, Caracas. The Sierra de Perijá National Park (295,288 ha) is the other major protected area with brown spider monkeys in Venezuela. In these national parks, enforcing hunting law and regulations for wood extraction are needed. There are no NGOs working actively with <em>Ateles hybridus hybridus </em>as target species, and governmental agencies should improve their conservation efforts. However, there is interest to continue surveys of these primates, especially in central Venezuela, and to implement an awareness programme at a local level. It is also fundamental to increase the number of park rangers and to improve their economic livelihood. Brown spider monkeys also occur in Caparo Forest Reserve (Venezuela) (Duque unpubl. data). <br/><br/>Bernstein <em>et al.</em> (1976a) showed the effect of forest disturbance, especially on <em>A. h. brunneus </em>(and <em>Lagothrix lagothricha lugens</em>), and (1976b) made a plea for the establishment of reserves for this and other threatened primate taxa. Fortunately, the Serranía de San Lucas in southern Bolívar still contains extensive forest which has been identified as a possible national park site. The establishment of a San Lucas National Park ought to have high priority in Colombia, since it would preserve many elements of the Nechí refuge, including <em>Saguinus leucopus</em>, <em>Cebus versicolor </em>and <em>L. l. lugens</em>. However, the presence of political insurgents, the military and some mine fields make the region very difficult to work in and inaccessible for government officials.&#160;<br/><br/>This species is listed on Appendix II of CITES.",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

The Red-shanked Douc is diurnal and arboreal but occasionally come to the ground as evinced by a number of camera-trap pictures within its range.<br/><br/>The species has been very little studied in the wild with only two long-term (&gt;12 months) studies, and other opportunistic observations (Lippold 1998; Phiapalath 2009; Ulibarri 2013). The diet of Red-shanked Douc consists mainly of leaves (consistently with a highest percentage of young leaves), followed by fruits/seeds, flowers, bark/pith (Nadler <em>et al</em>. 2003; Phiapalath 2009; Ulibarri 2013). The group dynamics of the species remain little understood. Studies suggest the species has a modular society characterized by fission-fusion of several one-male units gathering and dividing daily (Ulibarri 2013; Long Thang Ha pers. comm. 2015).<br/><br/>Because of this apparent group dynamics observed in the species and genus, home range is challenging to assess and needs to be distinguished between home range of the unit vs. home range of the group (i.e., fusion of &gt;1 units). In Lao PDR, the average home range for two groups (of 19 and 39 individuals, both comprising between 2 to 3 units) was estimated at 3 km²<sup> </sup>(Phiapalath 2009). In Viet Nam, home range of a group (21 individuals, including three units) was estimated at 36 ha (Ulibarri 2013). The striking contrast between these two estimates calls for additional long-term studies on the species. In Viet Nam, it was found that the fission–fusion pattern is strongly related to the daily activity budgets, food availability and rainfall (Ulibarri 2013). Average size of a unit was 6.5 individuals, average size of a group was 18 individuals, and groups averaged ~3 units/group. Units were one-male/multi-female and multi-male/multi-female (Ulibarri 2013).<br/><br/>The annual activity budget of <em>P. nemaeus</em> was estimated in limestone forest in Lao PDR at 40% feeding, 10% moving, 33% resting, 5% socialising and 14% other activities (Phiapalath 2009). In Viet Nam, in a coastal evergreen forest, the species spent 35% ‘inactive’, 29% moving, 22% socialising, 14% feeding and 1% self-grooming (Ulibarri 2013).<br/><br/>Additional research needs to be done on the ecology of the species to clarify its home range, group dynamics, diet and nutritional requirements.</p>","<p>Hunting has been and still is the major threat to <em>Pygathrix nemaeus</em> across its range. Habitat loss has also been a major threat in Viet Nam with extensive logging for coffee, rubber, and cashew plantations (Nadler <em>et al</em>. 2004), and in Lao PDR where logging is underway at an increasing rate for mining, agriculture, forestry and hydropower projects, mostly by large Chinese and Vietnamese companies (Smirnov 2015). Habitat loss and fragmentation have led to an increase in access to remote forests for illegal hunting of the species, contributing to the alarming declines of the global population. Hunting of the species across its range is for local consumption (the meat of doucs is highly favoured by locals) or for national and/or international trade. Pet trade in Red-shanked Douc may also drive hunting (Tran Thu Hang 2010), though to a lesser extent and is likely to be more opportunistic than directed, occurring when adults are killed leaving behind orphans, which are sold as pets. In Lao PDR, the species is hunted by both Lao and Vietnamese poachers crossing the border. Lao hunters often sell poached doucs to Vietnamese. Doucs are highly valued in Viet Nam for the traditional medicine; bones are processed to make a paste, which is used for the ‘treatment’ of various ailments. Due to hunting, Red-shanked Douc has already been largely extirpated throughout Viet Nam with the exceptions of populations in Phong Nha Ke Bang NP, where the species is apparently naturally protected by the difficult accessibility of this karst-based forest habitat, at least in its most remote sites, and in Son Tra NP where, although suitable forest for the species is now very limited, hunting seems under control and the species attracts a significant number of national and international tourists (Ha Thang Long pers. comm. 2015). In Virachey NP, illegal poaching occurs and doucs are hunted, most likely by Vietnamese poachers (G. McCann pers. comm. 2016). As douc populations are decreasing at an alarming rate, the hunting pressure on the species is expected to rise rapidly in all remaining areas where it occurs.<br/><br/>By the mid-to-late 1990s, Red-shanked Douc populations in several areas in Lao PDR and Viet Nam had already been greatly reduced or totally extirpated despite remaining suitable habitat (Timmins and Duckworth 1999; Nadler <em>et al. </em>2003). This decline has been continuous and is likely to be increasing with the demand and lucrative trade in wildlife including specifically Doucs. Populations in Viet Nam alone have decreased to just a few individuals left in most localities of occurrence (Nadler 2010). In Lao PDR, several sites that were visited in the mid-1990s and then again in the 2000s and 2010s suggest a surprising decline in Red-shanked Doucs (Coudrat <em>et al.</em> 2012; Gray <em>et al.</em> 2013) The still large and healthy population of Red-shanked Doucs are now confined to the largest forest blocks in the range countries (Phiaphalath 2009, Coudrat <em>et al.</em> 2013). However, in the past 36 years (and much less) habitat loss in range countries has been on the rise due to large development projects (e.g., dams, roads, mining, agriculture plantations) (Smirnov 2015); therefore those contiguous forest blocks—even protected areas—are much more extensively accessed today than in the recent past, which predicts a continuing decline in Red-shanked Doucs due to harvesting, principally in those areas with a lack of or poor conservation management; one or other of these situations applies to all protected areas holding the species.</p>","<p>The world’s largest remaining population of Red-shanked Douc Langur is in Lao PDR, particularly in the near-contiguous Nakai-Nam Theun and Hin Namno National Protected Areas (NPA), which are likely to represent the largest contiguous suitable habitat for the species (Coudrat <em>et al. </em>2012, 2013). Nakai-Nam Theun NPA probably holds the world’s largest population with an estimate of at least 4,500 groups in the area’s suitable habitat, estimated to comprise at least 1,600 km². Red-shanked Doucs are fairly frequently encountered in this area, although nowadays at lower rates than langurs <em>Trachypithecus</em> in Hin Namno NPA (Phiapalath 2009, Coudrat 2015); in the late 1990s rates were comparable between the genera (Timmins and Duckworth 1999). Xe Sap NPA also appears to retain a significant population (Coudrat <em>et al.</em> 2012, Gray <em>et al.</em> 2013). The most remote suitable forested areas in Lao PDR within the species’ range evidently still hold large numbers, but population estimates are not available for most areas. Despite the remaining large population in Lao PDR, the population in the past three decades has dramatically declined.<br/><br/>In Viet Nam, the population has declined extremely steeply due to intensive and continuous hunting and habitat loss; these threats are still ongoing and at an increasing rate. Many areas where doucs were recorded during the 1990s to 2002 lack evidence of their subsequent persistence (Nadler 2010). Wildlife surveys found &lt;30 individuals in Bach Ma NP (Le Thi Dien <em>et al.</em> 2010), about 30-70 individuals in Dak Rong NR (Nguyen Dac Manh <em>et al.</em> 2009, Dang Huy Huynh and Nguyen Manh Ha 2005) and a few groups (not comprehensive survey of the area) in Bac Huong Hoa NR (Mahood and Tran Van Hung 2008). The largest population in Viet Nam is believed to be in Phong Nha Ke Bang with up to 2,000 individuals (Haus <em>et al.</em> 2009), though this may be an over estimate (Nadler 2010). Son Tra NP, located near Da Nang, the fifth largest city of Viet Nam, is thought to hold the second largest population in Viet Nam. This is estimated at only about 200 individuals (Vu Ngoc Thanh<em> et al.</em> 2007; Lippold and Vu Ngoc Thanh 2008; Dinh Thi Phuong Anh <em>et al.</em> 2010). At this site, suitable habitat is no more than 50 km², amid a zone of large-scale infrastructure development, and hunting occurs occasionally in the area. Chu Mom Ray NP may still hold a small population, representing a possible zone of sympatry and/or hybridization, but the taxonomic status of the species there is uncertain (Lippold <em>et al.</em> 2011). Outside protected areas in Viet Nam, some small populations were recorded in the buffer zone of Phong Dien NR and Bach Ma NP (Van Ngoc Thinh <em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><br/>In Cambodia, animals genetically identifiable as Red-shanked Douc, but not morphologically typical, occur in Virachay National Park and a forest area in Voensai District. In both these areas the population is considered large based on frequent encounters (Rawson 2010). Grey-shanked Douc may also range in at least part of these areas, and hybridization has been recorded (Rawson and Roos 2008).</p>",Decreasing,"<p>This species occurs in eastern Lao PDR, central Viet Nam and, perhaps northeastern Cambodia. In Viet Nam Red-shanked Douc ranges from Pu Mat National Park (NP) (19°02’N) in the north to Chu Mom Ray NP (14°22’N) in the south (Ha Thang Long 2007, 2009). In Lao PDR, the species has been confirmed from Phou Chomvoy Provincial Protected Area (formerly known as Nam Theun Extension; 18°38’N), down to the Cambodian border (14°25’N) (Coudrat <em>et al.</em> 2012). In Cambodia, a few individuals were first observed in 2007 (at N14°01’52.2”, E106°44’05.6”) and again in 2008 (at N14°01’32.4”, E106°42’51.9”) in Voensei District, Ratanakiri Province. The individuals observed showed some facial characteristics of Red-shanked Douc, but were otherwise not typical of Red-shanked Douc morphologically (e.g., lacking red on the legs, lacking white on the forearms, mostly uniformly grey body but with some variations observed between individuals); some DNA (mitochondrial, autosomal and sex chromosome fragments) was extracted from faecal samples collected following the 2007-sighting, which indicated closest similarity to Red-shanked Douc (Rawson and Roos 2008). There has not been new genetic analysis on a larger sample since. Across its range, the species’ typical pelage characteristics are somewhat lost gradually from north to south: in southern Lao PDR, some individuals have also been observed with reduced red on the legs and white on the forearms (Timmins and Duckworth 1999). Additional genetic analysis on these animals will be required to clarify morphological characteristics of Red-shanked Douc and the distribution range of the species. Grey-shanked Douc might occur sympatrically with<em> </em>Red-shanked Douc in the southernmost part of the range of Red-shanked Douc<em>. </em>Previous suggestion that<em> </em>Black-shanked Douc occurs in the same site as Red-shanked Douc in northeastern Cambodia was in error (Rawson 2010; B. Rawson pers. comm. 2015).<br/><br/>The species has been recorded from around sea level to 1,700 m asl (Lippold 1998; Coudrat <em>et al.</em> 2012; Ulibarri 2013). Given patterns of survey, it is possible that it occurs, or occurred in the recent past, to altitudes considerably above 1,700 m.<em></em></p>",This species is hunted for meat and 'medicine'.

This decline is predicted to continue at the same rate or slightly higher in the next 36 years.","<p><span class=""None"">These animals are predominantly arboreal but occasionally come to the ground. They are found in evergreen, semi-evergreen and semi-evergreen-mixed deciduous forest mosaics, as well as in coastal dry forest. It seems that this species can adapt to relatively heavily disturbed forest (Nadler <em>et al</em>. 2003). The species occurs from sea level in Nui Chua NP to over 2,000 m asl. in Bidoup Nui Ba NP (Hoang Minh Duc 2007; Hoang Minh Duc pers. comm). Diet is apparently variable by site, being mainly composed of leaves with differing levels of supplementation with seeds, fruits and flowers (Hoang Minh Duc <em>et al</em>. 2009; Rawson 2009). The species consumes plant parts of more than 150 plant species but are quite selective. Factors determining food selection are poorly known. The species was reported to choose plant species with high in protein and low in tannin compared to non-selected species (O’Brien 2014) but another study did not confirm this conclusion (Hoang Minh Duc <em>et al.</em> 2011). The species shows seasonal shifting in habitat preferences in order to track leaf resources (O’Brien 2014).<span class=""None""><br/><br/>The annual activity budget of <em>P. nigripes</em> was estimated in evergreen forest in Cambodia at 61% inactivity, 27% feeding, 6% travel, 3% social behaviour, and 2% other activities (Rawson 2009) while in a coastal dry forest in Ninh Thuan Province of Viet Nam, the species spent 42.9% inactive, 35.0% feeding, 14.7% moving, 6.0% socializing, and 1.40% other behaviours (Hoang Minh Duc 2007). The species is reported to exhibit a fission-fusion social organization with smaller groups of one-male units banding together to form much larger groups (Hoang Minh Duc 2007, O’Brien 2014, Rawson 2009) and bachelor groups and lone males were also observed (Hoang Minh Duc 2007; Rawson 2009). Because of the complex social organization additional study is needed to understand ranging behavior. Home range of a group of <em>P. nigripes</em> in evergreen forest in Cambodia was estimated at 20.4 ha and daily path length ranged between 514 m and 943 m (Rawson 2009) while home range of a OMU with five individuals recorded in semi-evergreen forest in Binh Thuan Province was estimated at 12.4 ha and its daily path length was 354±250 m (Nguyen Thanh Trung and Hoang Minh Duc 2015).</span></p>","<p><span class=""None"">The key threats to the taxon include hunting for traditional medicine and local consumption and loss and fragmentation of forest habitats due to legal and illegal logging, conversion for agriculture, and construction of roads and hydroelectric dams.<br/><br/>Hunting is currently the major threat to this species (Nadler <em>et al.</em> 2003). It is most often hunted for traditional “medicine”, mainly from people coming from the north of Viet Nam where hunting of Doucs for this purpose is more common; in the southern part of Viet Nam, hunting is primarily for the pet trade. Between 2008 and 2010 there were a confirmed total of over 150 Black-shanked Doucs being poached in Viet Nam (Hoang Minh Duc pers. comm).<span class=""None""><br/><br/>Destruction of its natural habitat is also a threat to this species; a large portion in the centre and south of Viet Nam suffered from massive wartime damage, and the post-war human demographic explosion and extensive logging for coffee, rubber, and cashew plantations have reduced its natural habitat. Most forest at lowland elevations has been cleared and little forest remains undisturbed (Nadler <em>et al.</em> 2003). The resettlement of some 3 million people from the north of Viet Nam to the central highlands is likely to exacerbate rates of habitat loss through the Vietnamese range of the species. Development including new road construction in Mondulkiri Province, Cambodia has been associated with a rapid increase of illegal logging that is negatively impacting habitat for the Black-shanked Doucs.</span></p>","<span class=""None"">The largest known population exists in Seima Biodiversity Conservation Area, Mondulkiri Province, Cambodia, where distance estimates provide a population estimate of approximately 42,000 individuals (95% confidence interval of 27,309–66,460) (Pollard <em>et al</em>. 2007). The densities found in Seima are probably close to carrying capacity for the species in such habitat (Rawson 2009).

Like the other doucs, <em>Pygathrix cinerea</em> is largely arboreal and mainly folivorous, though plant buds, fruit, seeds, and flowers are also taken (Nadler <em>et al</em>. 2003; Ha Thang Long 2009). The most detailed study of the ecology of this species is Ha Thang Long (2009) and he found that their annual diet consisted of 49.5% young leaves, 9.3% mature leaves, fruits and seeds 40%. He also noted that there were significant differences in the diet between the wet and dry seasons with fruit being consumed at a much higher frequency in the wet season and the young leaves in the dry season. Ha Thang Long <em>et al.</em> (2010) reported on differences in activity budgets in the wet and dry season also. They found that this species’ activity budget in the wet season was 41% resting, 22% moving, 11% feeding, and 26% socializing.&#160; In contrast the activity budget during the dry season was 32% resting, 31% moving, 13% feeding, and 24% socializing.

A. Kumar (pers. comm.) has observed this species at 3,500 m, but has reports of its occurrence above this elevation, and it may be present up to 4,000 m. It is diurnal, terrestrial, arboreal, and folivorous. It is a diurnal and mainly terrestrial species, but may prefer arboreal canopies to flee from danger. Individuals are sometimes known to prefer barren rock cliffs for warmth.&#160;<br/><br/>Langurs inhabit semi evergreen Sal (<em>Shorea robusta</em>), and alpine cedar forests. They could range as high as as 3,500-4,000 m and could well survive harsh winters and rainy summers in July-October and an annual rainfall as high as 2,500 m. Most of their diet is composed of leaves (40-60%), and the rest of&#160; fruits (20%), ripe, unripe, herbaceous fruits. Other constituents are seeds, storage organs, roots, flowers, cambium, bark, twigs, coniferous cones, moss, lichens, epiphytic fern, young bamboo shoots, rhizome, grass and invertebrate animals. They prefer young leaves of broad-leaved deciduous trees than of evergreen trees. Seasonal variation in food preference is well pronounced. In spring and summer, when their diet is diverse, they feed on leaf clusters of <em>Zanthoxylem nepalense</em>, young leaves and bark of <em>Jasminum humile</em>, acorns, young deciduous leaves, and pine cones. In monsoon, feed on young deciduous leaves and fruits, while in autumn consume unripe fruits, seeds and fleshy ripe fruit, herb leaves and fruit, fleshy plant tissue, cultivated potato <em>Solanum tuberosum</em>. In winter, leaf buds, fruits (ripe) of <em>Cotonester frigidus, Berberis aristata, </em>leaf buds of <em>Sorbus cuspidate</em>, herbs and pinecones.<br/><br/>Birthing is concentrated between late winter to early spring and most mating happens between July-September. This arrangement allows for the langur infants to grow strong to survive their first winter. Besides, winters also mean migration down hill and the independent mobility of infants allows for easy migration for the both the mother and the infant. The inter-birth interval is usually 25 months, until the female gets pregnant and when she weans her infant. Inter-birth intervals are shorter when the infant dies and the female becomes receptive to mate again.<br/><br/>Like other Himalayan species, this species lives in multi-male, multi-female groups. Group sizes range between 4-47 individuals with 1-4 adult males and the female sex ratio 1-1.5-1.7. Larger groups may split while maintaining contact through intermittent call by males. The annual home range is 1,275-12,700 ha due to seasonal migration up and down the mountain. The call of dominant males is a ‘Wao’ or ‘Ua’ and these langurs don’t woop like the southern Indian or plain dwelling langurs.

A population reduction of more than 80% over three generations (39 years) is estimated, including a period of four years in the past and projected forwards for the next 35 years, due mainly to a decline in habitat quality as well as unsustainable levels of exploitation. The total population size was estimated between 260 and 330 individuals, which, according to new data from China (Long <em>et al.</em> 2012; Guangsong <em>et al.</em> 2014), is probably an underestimate.

There is no information how high up the mountains the monkeys go, but the highest mountain in this range is 3,660 m. According to local hunters, Snub-nosed Monkeys spend the summer (i.e., the snow-free times from May to October) mostly at higher altitudes, in mixed temperate forests and conifer forests.

Animals are hunted and trapped for their bones and heads, but most often monkeys are unintentionally trapped in iron traps that are set to trap deer or wild pigs to supply the local bush meat trade (this has been confirmed by local hunters and there is camera trap evidence of the monkeys travelling on the ground where traps have been set) (F. Momberg pers. comm. 2012). Already with the still limited construction work camps, commercial bush meat demand  has increased sharply over the last two years (2010-2011) and is set to accelerate (F. Momberg pers. comm. 2012). Monkeys may also be caught in traps set for bears (T. Geissmann pers. comm. 2012).<br/><br/>Habitat degradation, due to the creation of roads and other infrastructure is rapidly becoming a major threat. Logging roads have now been built into all the areas occupied by this species since 2009 (some are within 200 m of the camera traps) (F. Momberg pers. comm. 2012). With the increased access, the influx of Chinese workers to the area as part of the logging and dam building operations is accelerating and it is expected that when the dams reach the full construction stage there will be at least 10,000 workers employed in this area (F. Momberg pers. comm. 2012).<br/><br/>Habitat loss due the impacts of logging is very serious due to large scale mechanical logging (blasting of logging roads, use of heavy equipment and winches, reaching ridges and even peaks) taking place, especially as the largest part of the range area is conifer forest and during the snow-covered winter months the Snub-nosed Monkeys (just as <span style=""font-style: italic;"">R. bieti</span>) depend on lichens for food (F. Momberg pers. comm. 2012). As the logging is effecting most mature conifer trees, food sources especially in winter are becoming scarce. The logging practices are causing serious destruction because logging takes place at high altitudes and even on slopes with more than 70 degrees slope inclination (these areas are accessed using winches and roads are blasted through cliffs). Land slides are becoming increasingly common as a result of the loss of tree cover. The&#160; lower mountain broad leaf forest is also impacted by logging (targeting hardwoods) and landslides caused by logging roads. Shifting cultivation reaches from the N'mai Hka river valley up to 2,000 meters, flooding following dam construction will displace shifting cultivation areas in the valley bottom to higher areas, increasing the pressures on the Snub-nosed Monkey habitat (F. Momberg pers. comm. 2012).<p><span lang=""EN-IN"">At present, the conservation status of the monkey in China remains unclear. Hunting&#160;remains a threat as understood from the hunting tools in use in the community around the habitat. In one instance, <em>R. strykeri</em> was reared as pet.</p><p>Given the various projects coming up in the species’ range, and based on the ongoing (over the last 10 years) and increasing levels of hunting and habitat loss, it is suspected that the species will undergo rapid declines of over 80% in the future, especially then next 30-35 years.</p>","<p><span lang=""EN-IN"">Geissmann&#160;<em>et al</em>.

In the past, excessively intense and unsustainable legal and illegal logging and gold mining were the biggest threats. Recently, the development of a hydroelectric power project along the Gam River in Na Hang has seriously impacted its habitat, plus the sudden increases in human populations, especially construction workers, have led to increased demand for meat, and thus increased hunting pressure (Le Xuan Canh and Boonratana, 2006). At the present time, hunting pressure continues to be high in Na Hang.

The latest study at this location, in 2009-2010, found far lower densities. It is thought that hunting pressure is the reason for low densities in Tat Ke Sector. The highest estimate for any one population was in the Ban Bung sector of the Na Hang Nature Reserve, at between 90 and 110 individuals in 1992 (Ratajszczak <em>et al</em>. 1992). There has been significant population decline in both sectors of the Na Hang Nature Reserve, Tat Ke and Ban Bung (Le Xuan Canh and Boonratana 2006, Thach Mai Hoang 2011). Understanding of the number or the size of the subpopulations, with the exception of Khau Ca, is poor: with estimate of <em>ca</em> 20 individuals in Na Hang Nature Reserve (Thach Mai Hoang 2011); lack of recent observations at Cham Chu Nature although it may still occur at this site (Dong Thanh Hai <em>et al</em>. 2006); 130 individuals confirmed in the Tonkin Snub Nosed Monkey Species/Habitat Conservation Area at Khau Ca (Le Khac Quyet, pers. obs. 2015); and possibly 30-40 individuals in Tung Vai forest of Quan Ba District, Ha Giang Province, close to Chinese-Vietnamese border (Nguyen Van Truong 2012). Thus, the global population estimate at approximately 200-250 individuals may be higher than it is in the wild.</p><p><span class=""None""></p>",Decreasing,"This species is confined to a few areas in northeastern Viet Nam east of the Red River (Fooden 1996, Groves 2001, Nadler <em>et al</em>. 2003, Le Khac Quyet and Covert 2010).

Numbers are estimated to have declined by over 70% (but probably less that 80%) over the past three generations (36 years), and based on the continuing threats it is predicted to decline at the same rate over the next one generation in the future at least.","This species is associated with riparian-riverine forests, coastal lowland forest, including mangroves, peat swamp, and freshwater swamp forest (Boonratana 2000). It rarely ranges far from its local habitat's waterway (Meijaard and Nijman 2000). It has been suggested that it is restricted to the coastal areas and areas near rivers because the interior has soils that are low in minerals and salts, which are a necessary part of its diet (Bennett and Sebastian 1988). It is found at low elevations, up to no more than about 350 m asl (Meijaard and Nijman 2000).<br/><br/>The species is mostly folivorous (about 52% of all feedings) and frugivorous (about 40% of all feedings), and prefers young leaves and unripened non-fleshy fruits. Monthly diet of this species changes with availability throughout the year (Yeager 1989). Boonratana (2000) observed this species swimming across the Kinabatangan River in northern Borneo, and frequently across its tributaries. The home range size of a focal one-male group was 220.5 ha (Boonratana 2000). Boonratana (2000) reports that this species never entered agricultural lands, nor areas used intermittently as log dumps for logging operations carried out in the area before and during the study. This species returned to the river every night at the study site of Sukau, moving inland during the day (Boonratana 2000). It avoids areas with heavy deforestation, such as agricultural land (Salter and MacKenzie 1985). Where there is no hunting the species can persist in disturbed forests and secondary habitats.","Because of this species' association with riverine and coastal habitat, the major cause for its recent decline is thought to be habitat destruction. People favour these animals' habitats for logging, cultivation, and settlement. The planned land use for Central Kalimantan cited by E. Meijaard illustrates this tendency, with much of the riverine forest being marked for conversion. Clearing riverbanks and mangroves has a significant impact. Forest fires, especially those along the rivers, have a major impact on distribution. The 1997-1998 Bornean forest fires were thought to have destroyed the greatest proportion of remaining habitat of any primate in Kalimantan.<br/><br/>The species is relatively lethargic and easily hunted; with little effort entire populations can be hunted to extirpation. Opportunistic hunting of <em>Nasalis larvatus</em> for food occurs; the species is also hunted for bezoar stones, an intestinal secretion used in traditional Chinese medicine. Hunting has been felt most significantly in the Bornean interior, but is increasing in coastal areas (Meijaard and Nijman 2000).","In Sarawak, less than 1,000 animals are thought to remain in patchily distributed populations. In Sabah, the only remaining large populations are in the Kinabatangan flood plain, and around Dewurst Bay in the Eastern Deltas. Brunei estuaries support one population. The species is in greater abundance in Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo), where Meijaard surveyed the population. The Indonesian populations range in size from over 1,000 to less than 100, depending on past and current threats (Meijaard and Nijman 2000). The Pulau Kaget Nature Reserve population in South Kalimantan has reportedly been extinct since 1997 (Meijaard and Nijman 2000). Also, the population in the Mahakam Delta, East Kalimantan which would have numbered in the thousands up until the early 1990s, has now been decimated due to conversion of the coastal swamps to shrimp farms (E. Meijaard pers. comm.).",Decreasing,"This species is endemic to Borneo, occurring in Brunei, Indonesia (Kalimantan) and Malaysia (Sabah and Sarawak).

In some portions of its range its legal protection suffers from governmental and institutional deficiencies, including lack of conservation funds and knowledge, and poor and inappropriate management (Meijaard and Nijman 2000). It is known to occur in 16 protected areas: Danau Sentarum Wildlife Reserve, Gunung Palung Nature Reserve, Kendawangan Nature Reserve, Kutai National Park, Lesan Protection Forest, Muara Kaman Nature Reserve, Mandor Reserve, Tanjung Putting National Park (Indonesia); Bako National Park, Gunung Pueh Forest Reserve, Kabili-Sepilok Forest Reserve, Klias National Park, Kulamba Wildlife Reserve, Lower Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary, Sungei Samunsam Wildlife Sanctuary, Ulu Segama Reserve (Malaysia).

This decline is predicted to continue at the same rate or higher over the next three generations. Ongoing threats from increasing habitat loss due to development, new settlements, agriculture, plantation, and other activities, and from hunting for various reasons, the species is likely to face a higher threat of decline unless specific actions are taken to ensure its survival. Nationally, in India this species is listed as Endangered, and in Bangladesh it is Critically Endangered.</p>","This is a predominantly arboreal animal. It is diurnal and frugivorous. It occupies tropical evergreen and semi­-evergreen forest, tropical wet evergreen forest, tropical&#160; moist deciduous forest, coastal forest, swamp forest, low elevation pine forests (in Lao PDR and China) and montane forest, including degraded forests. In China the species occupies elevations between 50­2,000 m (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003, Choudhury 2003). In Lao PDR and Viet Nam the species is associated with low lands, usually below 500 m. Its generation length is 12-­13 years (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003). According to secondary information and recent records, populations in Myanmar live between 190­-400 m (S. Htun pers. comm).<br/><br/>Dark evergreen and semi-evergreen forests, tropical, subtropical and deciduous forests in plains, foothills, hills. (50-2,000 m). Found in lowland primary, secondary forest, pine, dry dipterocarp, coastal swamp, montane forest. Frequently observed in riparian forests in western Thailand and Laos, occasionally near human settlements, cultivated fields where it once relatively common (back in 1990), even in highly degraded regions. Known to share associations with Assamese macaques (<em>Macaca assamemensis</em>) western Thailand and the ranges of the two species were observed to overlap in Assam. Range overlaps also with Stump-tailed and Rhesus macaques besides langurs and Hoolocks (Anwaruddin Choudhury in litt., July 2019).<br/><br/>This species eats more than 91 kinds of plants such as mature and tender leaves, leaf buds, leaf petioles, seeds, stems, climbers, roots, flowers, flower buds, inflorescences, bamboo shoots, and gums, insects, larvae, termite eggs and spiders. They also feed on post-harvest Rice paddy in NE India and fruits and vegetables by slash and burn agriculture of the hill tribe. Habituated groups have also been observed to beg for food and feed on biscuits as in Khao Yai National Park, Thailand.<br/><br/>In NE India, winter-spring breeding has been observed. Females are sexually receptive in August-December, but some might continue through to February. Birthing occurs in mid-January, early May, and a few in June. Swellings occur during breeding, as in Lion-tailed Macaques (<em>Macaca silenus</em>). Gestation period is 171-180 days (Choudhury 2008).<br/><br/>This species is primarily arboreal, but it may use both terrestrial and arboreal pathways; individuals flee from danger through trees and not by ground. They use the ground when crossing clearings, roads, to forage, feed in degraded areas and also feed on crops. Seasonal fluctuations dictate the time spent on the ground feeding on crops. One site reported macaques spending over 20% of their time feeding on the ground on sugar cane left overs by elephants (<em>Elephas maximus</em>). Detailed observation of the species in eastern and central Assam in 1992-1994 and 2004 recorded three peaks of feeding and long mid-day rest, shorter mid-morning rest spells, resting 45%, feeding 23.5%, locomotion 17-19.4%, grooming 6-8%. Actual time spent feeding 153-229 mins/day. Spent 65% of feeding time in January on harvested paddy.<br/><br/>In Assam (Tikleswari, Borajan) the macaques raids the vegetable gardens, crop field and villages (Chetry and Das pers. comm).<br/><br/>Home range is 83-347 ha, with about 25-48% overlap (Choudhury 2008). Daily movement is 690-2,240 m, influenced by weather and availability of fruits: where fruiting trees were far apart, the daily movement increased. Multi-male, multi-female groups of 12-40 individuals are seen (Choudhury 2008). Estimated group size in Laos rarely exceeds 20-30 individuals. There are few records of groups numbering 50-150 individuals in KhaoYai National Park in Thailand, DakLak Province in Viet Nam and DhouPhouVieng National Biodiversity Conservation Area in Laos. It may be the case that two or more groups were feeding together.<br/><br/>Niche occupation studies by Feroz (2012) in Bangladesh indicated the mean group size of 19.8 (13-26) individuals, with a density of 2.5-6.9 individuals/km2 as studied in 21 sites.&#160; They spent only about 1% of their time on the ground and about 85% of their time on mid canopy and in 97.6% of the cases found inside the forest as opposed to the sympatric <em>M. mulatta </em>that is found outside forests in farms and gardens. Direct competition was found to be scarce between the species and the overlap or sharing of resources was only found to be 22.4%. Of the 101 plant species used between both the species, only 42.6%&#160; shared (Feroz, 2012).<br/><br/>In KhaoYai National Park,Thailand these macaques preferred tall sleeping trees (mean 20.9+/- SD 4.9 m) and ‘high sleeping places’(15.8+/- SD 4.3 m) and tend to reuse the sleeping site, an anti-predator strategy (Albert <em>et al</em>. 2011).","Habitat disturbances affecting the future survival of this species include: selective logging; timber and firewood collection for making charcoal; building roads, dams, power lines; and deliberately setting fires. These threats lead to&#160; forest fragmentation and soil loss/erosion. Specifically, a decrease in habitat quality has been due to the loss of fruiting trees and sleeping sites through monocultures and plantations, selective felling, and a subsequent increase in canopy gaps. These animals are hunted and traded for food, sport and traditional “medicine”, and accidental mortality due to trapping occurs. There is a local trade for bones, meat for food and the live animals as pets (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003). Habitat loss and poaching are the major threats in India and Bangladesh. There has been a reduction in forest in Assam by over 10% in two years between 2001 and 2003 (Forest Survey of&#160; India 2003) and the rate of habitat loss has not reduced. Recent forest cover survey report of Ministry of Environment Forest and Climate Change, Government of India suggest that the dense forest cover in the distribution range is decreasing 2011-2013.<br/><br/>In Lao PDR, Viet Nam and Cambodia, hunting for food and trade is the primary threat, but as a predominantly lowland species habitat&#160; loss likely is also a major threat to the&#160; species. In Thailand, the males of this species are exploited for picking coconuts by the industry. Sometimes, a well-trained macaque is sold for 1,000 USD. They are also in demand by resorts for show (R. Boonratana pers. comm). <br/><br/>In Myanmar, hunting, trade, habitat loss in varying degrees, shifting cultivation in the north, logging in the east and south, and rubber plantations are the major threats (S. Htun pers. comm).<br/><br/>In China, hunting, habitat loss and disturbance are major threats. There is a perceptible change in habitat quality that has an impact on the species (Huang <em>et al</em>. pers. comm).","In China, the species’ population is estimated to be less than 1,700 individuals (Jiang and Long pers. comm). No information is available on the status of the population dynamics, but it is suspected to be in decline. A very small population occurs in Bangladesh, which is isolated from the neighbouring Indian locations. This habitat is degrading rapidly, thereby causing a continuing decline in mature individuals in the country (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003). <br/><br/>A group density of 0.07 individuals/km² was recorded in Namdapha National Park, India, by Chetry <em>et al</em>. (2003). There is no precise information available on population numbers in Myanmar. In India the population is &lt;1,500 individuals and populations are declining rapidly (Chetry and Das pers. comm.) but in one protected area (Gibbon Wildlife Sanctuary) it is increasing. Choudhury (2003) stated that there may have been around 24,000 of these macaques in India at the turn of this century. The population has apparently declined owing to habitat loss.<br/><br/>Niche occupation studies by Feroz (2012) in Bangladesh indicated the mean group size of 19.8 (13-26) individuals, with a density of 2.5-6.9 individuals/km² as studied in 21 sites. The mean of seven groups in Assam was 23.3 (range: 16-33) (Choudhury 2008); however, the largest group observed was of 43 macaques in Radhakishorepur reserved forest, Tripura in 2016 (Choudhury 2017).<br/><br/>It is also declining steadily in Myanmar.&#160; The animals are very patchily distributed in Myanmar. <br/><br/>The species is widely distributed and common in large forest blocks remaining in southern and central Lao PDR, but it is much scarcer in northern Lao PDR and Viet Nam (R. Timmins pers. comm). It is widely distributed through the remaining forest areas of Cambodia. Populations are stable in Thailand. <br/><br/>Declines are due to different threats in different countries. There have been declines of more than 30% in the last 30­-35 (three generations) years in India, Bangladesh, China, Viet Nam and Myanmar. There are perceptible declines in Lao PDR and Cambodia, but the rates are close to or lower than 30%. In most of the countries, the species is predicted to decline at a rate higher than 30% over the next three generations due to increasing trends in habitat loss, persecution, and trade.",Decreasing,"This species occurs in eastern Bangladesh, Cambodia, southern China (southwestern Yunnan), northeastern India (Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland and Tripura (Choudhury 1988, 2013)), Lao PDR, Myanmar (including the Mergui Archipelago), Thailand (from about 8°N and including adjacent islands), and central and southern Viet Nam. There might be a gap in the distribution in central and northeastern Myanmar between about 20 and 25°N, where it has not been recorded except on the coast at Arakan. In India found north to the Brahmaputra River (Groves 2001).<br/><br/>Records from Xizang (China) are probably misidentified rhesus macaques (MacKinnon in press).  It has recently been recorded from Namdapha National Park in northeastern India (Chetry <em>et al</em>. 2003). <br/><br/>The precise taxonomic boundary between <em>M. leonina</em> and <em>M. nemestrina</em> is not well defined. There are populations of the two taxa found on either side of the distribution limits in the Isthmus of Kra, but many of these populations are the result of release by humans. The two species hybridize in a small area of southern peninsular Thailand, as well as on the islands of Phuket and Yao Yai (Groves 2001).  <br/><br/>In Viet Nam, there are historical records from as far north as Nghe An province, but there is uncertainty whether the species was ever found north of this province. It is widely distributed throughout the lower elevations (below 500 m) of Lao PDR and Cambodia (R. Timmins pers. comm.). It is found over much Myanmar except in areas of human settlements.","In Thailand, the males of this species are exploited for picking coconuts by the industry.

Although in their incipient stage, agriculture, mining and hydropower are causing significant damages in terms of forest loss. In Cambodia, the species is reported only in five out of 24 provinces: use in traditional medicine, loss of habitat from logging, and trade are major threats in the region. In Myanmar, logging, plantation, aquaculture, hunting for food and pets, political unrest in cultural minority states impact primates. Timber extraction, large scale farms and plantations, irrigation, hydroelectric projects, highway construction, mineral exploration, resettlement programs for hill tribes, recreation and tourism, have significantly reduced forest cover in Thailand. Shifting cultivation of hill tribes and ethnic Thais have cleared large forests.

It prefers dense evergreen forests (Choudhury 2001). Srivastava and Mohnot (2001) report it from lowland semi­evergreen forests to monsoon and montane forests. In India, it occurs at elevations of 50­2-700m (Molur <em>et </em><em>al</em>. 2003; Choudhury 2001, 2002; Srivastava and Mohnot 2001), between 200 and 2,200 m in Myanmar (Htun pers. comm.), and up to 2,400 m in China (X. Jiang pers. comm.); in Viet Nam, Lao PDR and Cambodia it is predominantly found above 400 m, while in karst limestone environments it is found in much lower elevations (R. Timmins pers. comm.). It is considered arboreal as well as terrestrial, and is diurnal. It feeds primarily on seeds and fruits. It has a generation time of 10­-12 years (Molur <em>et </em><em>al</em>. 2003). It eats fruit, insects, small vertebrates, and immature leaves, and will also raid crops for potatoes and rice. It occurs widely in the hill and mountain areas of VietNam, Lao PDR and Cambodia (R.

These animals are hunted and traded for food, sport and traditional “medicine,” and accidental mortality due to trapping occurs. There is a local trade for bones, meat for food and the live animals as pets (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>In India much of its habitat is affected by Jhum cultivation (shifting or slash­and­burn) (Srivastava and Mohnot 2001). It has also been indiscriminately hunted over almost its entire distribution in India (Srivastava and Mohnot 2001). The vulnerability of being hunted is due to large body size and terrestrial in habit (Chetry and Das pers.com)<br/><br/>In Viet Nam, this species is heavily targeted for use in traditional “medicine,” both in country and for trade with China. Agriculture, hydropower and mining developments are the other threats that need to be watched.<br/><br/>Within Lao PDR, Viet Nam and Cambodia, hunting levels for food is also very high. Habitat loss is a relatively lower threat compared to hunting (R. Timmins pers. comm).<br/><br/>In Cambodia, where Stump-tailed Macaques are found only in three of 24 sites, are yet threatened by concession mining, and land mining are existing threats even in protected areas.<br/><br/>In Laos, the species suffers from opportunistic hunting in their area of occurrence across the country for supply of bones for 'medicinal' use in Vietnam is threatening the population. Logging, gold mining and shifting cultivation are accounted as some direct threats. Other threats include extensive poaching and earlier were used in manufacturing polio medicine. Poaching for traditional medicine is still on unabated and therefore pressing the remaining population. Absence of any new conservation measure is in not helping the situation either.<br/><br/>In Myanmar, logging and timber extraction are major threats. Commercial rubber plantations, hunting, and trade of animals parts with China are all major threats to this species. In China, hunting and habitat loss have reduced in population of this species, and it is locally extinct in some places. Over hunting might have extirpated the population in Guangdong Province. Habitat loss from plundering of evergreen broad leaf forest is a serious threat. In Thailand, habitat loss is a major threat, while hunting is prevalent, but not a significant threat to the species (R. Boonratana pers. comm). Until 1976, until the ban on international trade in 1976 of primates, trade and export of Stump-tailed Macaque was well and active. The United States of America alone imported <em>ca</em> 30,000 primates from Thailand, mostly macaques, for use in biomedical research and some were famously sold as ‘miniature chimpanzees’. The population in peninsular Thailand was thus significantly reduced due to this trapping for trade and export. Large scale farming, plantations, marine product use resulting in habitat loss and habitat degradation has also affected the population.</p>","<p>Populations in South Asia and in Myanmar are few and fragmented (Molur <em>et al.</em> 2003; S.Htun pers. comm.). This species is suspected to be extinct in Bangladesh, having last been recorded there in 1989 (M. Feeroz pers. comm.). It is very scarce all over its range in north eastern India, however, it is common in the mountains of Nagaland, Manipur, and eastern Mizoram (Choudhury 2001). In India the protected areas it is found in are - Arunachal Pradesh- Mehao WLS, Namdapha National Park, Assam- Barail Wildlife Sanctuary and Reserved Forest, Innerline Reserved Forest, Hollongapar Gibbon Wildlife Sanctuary, Meghalaya-Balpakram National Park, Nokrek National Park, Mizoram- Murlen National Park; (Choudhury 2002; Das and Chetry pers. com.) In China the species is still common in Yunnan, though the populations are thought to be lower in the eastern portions of its range but recent record suggest that there is still existence of the species in Bangladesh.<br/><br/>China: In 2015, 23,000 individuals were estimated in China’s National survey on mammal populations (Long and Jiang pers. comm).  </p><p>India: &lt;1,000 individual estimated in the south bank of river Brahmaputra and east of Dibang River in Northeast India and it is critical in India (Chetry and Das pers. comm) many places, the populations have gone extinct locally (Chang pers. comm). </p>  <p>There are no available population estimates for this taxon in Lao PDR, Viet Nam, Cambodia and Thailand (R. Boonratana pers. comm.), although the population is likely to be large, as the species is frequently encountered throughout the range of distribution in these countries.<br/><br/>Populations of this species are critically threatened in India, declining in Myanmar, stable in Thailand and China, and declining in Viet Nam. There are some declines in Lao PDR and Cambodia. Future declines are predicted to be faster in Lao PDR, Viet Nam, India, Myanmar and China due to habitat loss and/or hunting. <br/><br/>The population is declining rapidly in India except in the few protect areas, in fact, the species has been extirpated outside the protected areas except in few reserve forests (Chetry and Das pers. comm).</p>",Decreasing,"<p>This species is found in Cambodia, south­western China (Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Guizhou, and Yunnan provinces), north­eastern India (Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, and Tripura states), Lao PDR, north­western Peninsular Malaysia, northern Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam. It appears that some occur on the border between Tripura and Chittagong Hill Tracks as confirmed in February 2016. The macaques were on the both sides of the border. There are also&#160;a few dubious records in central and north­western Thailand. It was formerly found in eastern Bangladesh as well, but the species has vanished from most parts of its former range in Bangladesh. In China, it is found south of 25°N. The species has been introduced to Hong Kong. In north­eastern India, it was long believed to be restricted to the south bank of the Brahmaputra River (Choudhury 1988),&#160;Namdapha is also on the south/east bank of the Brahmaputra and is a known stronghold of the species.&#160;However, it is to be seen whether it occurs north of the Lohit River, a major tributary of the Brahmaputra from where there are unconfirmed reports.&#160;Srivastava and Mohnot (2001), J. Das (pers. comm.) and Chetry <em>et al.</em> (2003) report possible records of this species from Namdapha National Park, though they were morphologically distinct from other representatives of the species, and could represent an undescribed subspecies.

These declines are significant, but probably are not yet enough to qualify for listing as Vulnerable (i.e., 30% over three generations or 36 years). If the threats continue or increase in the future, the species will have to be reassessed and it may then move into a threatened category.</p>","<p>This species is diurnal and omnivorous, and at times both arboreal and terrestrial. It prefers dense forest (Choudhury 2001), and does not usually occur in secondary forest. It is found in tropical and subtropical semi­evergreen forests, dry deciduous and montane Forest (Srivistava and Mohnot 2001, R. Boonratana pers. comm.). Particular habitats and niches vary some depending on the subspecies. This species is found from the floodplains to the high mountains, up to 2,800 m, and sometimes 3,000 m in the summer (Choudhury 2001), and perhaps up to 4,000 m (Srivastava and Mohnot 2001, Zhang <em>et</em><em> </em><em>al</em>. 2002). It is generally an upland species, and usually associated with hill areas above 1,000 m. In the wetter east the species may also frequent areas that do not or only marginally reach 1,000m and may occur even in the lowlands. In Lao PDR and Viet Nam the species is predominantly associated with high altitudes, usually above 500 m. In forests on limestone karst the species occurs in much lower elevations (R. Timmins pers. comm.). Six sites at 200-400 m asl range in Karst habitats were reported from Lao PDR: Houay Phasong, Nam Ngo, and 4 sites in Muang Vilabouli (Timmins and Duckworth 2013)</p>  <p>The generation of this species is 10­-12 years (Molur <em>et</em><em> </em><em>al</em>. 2003). There is a wide preference of vegetation across the macaque distribution. From subtropical mid-elevation montane broadleaf rainforests and temperate evergreen forests of higher elevations. In Thailand, they occupy mixed deciduous/bamboo dry evergreen forest from lowland to mountainous areas. Rocky crags and karsts are also preferred sleeping sites. They are also found close to human settlements where they are provisioned and in many areas like Kanchanaburi Province (14°41’N), Thailand they have resorted to begging. </p>  <p>There is a gradual change in preference for food in certain areas of their distribution such as in Darjeeling, West Bengal of which eleven of their 63 preferred plant species are cultigens. Generally, their natural diet includes fruits such as banana, mango, papaya, apple, litchi, cucumber, papaya, orange, bamboo shoots, and leaves. They are also used to feeding of human hands and prefer food such as bread, other varieties of cooked snacks, molasses. </p>  <p>In Assam the species raid the vegetable gardens, crop land and villages near to their habitats (Chetry and Das pers. comm.).</p>  <p>Dietary studies in Nonggang, China, conducted between 2005 and 2006 suggest folivorous inclination: 77.4% of all feeding records were of leaves and 17.4% of total feeding records were of fruits. Young leaves formed the ‘bulk’ of the diet with their consumption ration varying from 44.9% in July to 92.9% in May. <em>Indocalamus</em><em> </em><em>calicolus</em>, a type of bamboo and its unexpanded leaves formed the bulk of the young leaf diet (Zhou <em>et al</em><em>.</em>&#160;2011)</p>  <p>Follow-up studies conducted in Nonggang between 2012 and 2013 corroborate the finding. While leaves were dominant in the diet (75.5%), the leaves of&#160; <em>Bonia</em><em> </em><em>saxatilis</em> bamboo were more preferred as opposed to <em>Indocalamus</em><em> </em><em>calicolus</em>. Seventy-eight food species were reported to be consumed by the macaques in the region (Huang <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014) </p>  <p>Modest swelling of sexual skin during breeding. Gestation of 5.5 months and single young born every two years. There is seasonal migration to higher altitudes in summer and to lower altitudes in winter. Multimale-multifemale type social organization. Schulke <em>et al.</em> (2010) derived the relationship between social bonds and reproductive success in wild macaques in Thailand. Tight social bonds in male macaques was seen to promote good ‘coalition’ which in turn translated into social dominance and reproductive success. Female Assamese macaques tend to exhibit ‘non-random’ and ‘promiscuous’ mating across male ranks and mate more frequently with certain males while exhibiting ‘concealed’ fertility. This tactic could in fact protect infants during intra-troop change in male dominance and as suggested in the literature, to main special and particular bonds in a rather open and ‘promiscuous’ environment (Furtbauer <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2014)</p>  <p>Average group size of 20 individuals. Group size in Nonggang 15-17 individuals. Single males outside group have been spotted.</p>  <p>Home range of 53-65 ha and mean daily path length of 590-782 m as studied in Nonggang Food distribution seems to influence the macaques distribution wherein most of their time was seen to be spent on cliffs (71.7% of total location records) and hillsides (20.2%). The cliffs and hill tops are often inundated with <em>Indocalamus</em><em> </em><em>calcicolus</em>, the primary preferred leaf source of macaques (Zhou <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011,&#160;2014).</p>  <p>Parasite prevalence rate in Assamese macaques in Shivpuri Nagarjuna National Park was 72.94%. Protozoan and helminth parasites were found during faecal studies in the macaques suggesting such parasites as conservation threats to the species (Pokhrel and Maharajan 2014). </p>","The threats to this species' habitat include selective logging and various forms of anthropogenic development and activities, alien invasive species, and hunting and trapping for sport,“medicine,” food, and the pet trade. Additionally, hybridization with adjacent species poses a threat to some populations (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003). Although it has a wide distribution, the species is considered to be threatened in most parts of its range. Habitat destruction is the primary cause of the decline. <br/><br/>Habitat destruction poses the greatest risk to this species in northeastern India (Srivastava and Mohnot, 2001). However, it has been hunted in the Himalayan regions of North Bengal, Sikkim, and Arunachal Pradesh, where it frequently invades crops (Srivastava and Mohnot, 2001). Locals use skulls as an “evil eye” in front of houses in northeastern India (Das pers. comm.). There has been extensive habitat loss over the last 15 years in several states of northeastern India (from 30 to 60%), with major impacts on <em>M. a. assamensis</em>. <br/><br/>The Nepal population of <em>Macaca assamensis </em>is threatened due to its restricted distribution of less than 2,200 km² extent of occurrence and 914 km area of occupancy and continuing decline in area, extent and quality of habitat, the number of locations and in the number of mature individuals the latter two conditions being inferred from threats to habitat and population from degradation and hunting, respectively. Given its restricted extent of occurrence, threats on its population and habitat, and small numbers in fragmented patches, the Nepal population of this macaque is categorized as Endangered.<br/><br/>In Thailand habitat loss is the primary threat, hunting for food less so (R. Boonratana pers. comm.). It is protected only in temples.<br/><br/>In eastern Myanmar habitat loss is the primary threat, but hunting is presumed to occur. They are hunted to make footwear, and the skins are taken to Tibet as it is more profitable than taking it to Yunnan province of China. In northern Myanmar, hunting and habitat loss due to conversion are the major threats. There is more than 30% decline in forest cover over the last 30-­35 years. The combination of habitat loss and hunting heavily impacts the subpopulations, and the threats are likely to continue in the next three decades if the demand for this continues in Tibet (S. Htun pers. comm.).<br/><br/>In Lao PDR and Viet Nam the primary threat is hunting for food and for bones to make balm and/or glue. The bones are not used within Lao PDR, but sold to Viet Namese and traders within Lao PDR. The balm is used for pain relief and other speculative “medicinal” purposes. The trade also goes into China (R. Boonratana pers. comm.). This species has declined in VietNam and Lao PDR in the last 30-35 years by more than 30%, and is expected to continue to decline in the future.<br/><br/>In Tibet the habitat is good, but there is some hunting, and no detailed data exists for <em>M. a. pelops</em> from that region of China (Z. Zhou et al. pers. comm.). For <em>M. a. assamensis</em>, Hunting is a major threat. Logging has ceased, but was a major threat for the last 30 years. Conversion to pastures is still ongoing, but not a significant threat There are extensive habitats still left for this subspecies and the taxon is relatively safe. <br/><br/>Habitat reduction and degradation, agricultural activities, mining, rapid developmental activities in certain areas of the macaque’s distribution, hunting for food, traditional medicine, selective logging, loss of fruiting trees and human encroachment into critical macaque habitat, gold mining and shifting cultivation in Viet Nam, limestone mining destroying the macaques preferred habitats. Poaching for food and hunting for sale, political unrest in Myanmar are some existing serious threats.","There is little information available on the global population. Although it is thought to be relatively high, there is decline in the wild populations in certain countries, but not throughout the distribution. It is probably the most common macaque species in Lao PDR, where it is widespread through hill and mountain forest ranges, though no population estimate is available (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, R. Timmins pers. comm). In Nepal the taxon is also restricted to less than 300 mature individuals, distributed in eight subpopulations, with no subpopulation having more than 50 mature individuals. There is no information on population estimates from Thailand (R. Boonratana pers. comm). In northern Myanmar it is a very common species, but information from the eastern part of the country is not available (S. Htun pers. comm). <br/><br/>Due to hunting pressure, macaques in Viet Nam are scarce. However, there is no precise information for this species on population and status (R. Timmins pers. comm). The subspecies <em>M. a. assamensis </em>is relatively widespread in its extent of occurrence (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003). In Namdapha National Park, Arunachal Pradesh, India, the population was found to have a group density of 1.11/km and an average group size of 13.93 individuals (Chetry <em>et al</em>. 2003). This species is the most abundant monkey in the mountains of Arunachal Pradesh (Choudhury 2001). In China 8,200 individuals is reported in 2009 (Long and Jiang pers. comm). The subspecies <em>M. a. pelops</em> is only found in adjacent populations in India, Bhutan, and adjacent China. There are likely fewer than 1,000 individuals remaining (Zhang <em>et al</em>. 2002). A subpopulation of <em>M. assamensis </em>is endemic to Nepal and relegated to a single population there, and is considered as a possible new subspecies (M. Chalise pers. comm.). However, further taxonomic clarification is needed.<br/><br/>No new population estimate in any of the macaque’s distribution. The macaques though have seen remarkable decline in population over the years and still under threat (refer to threats section) from numerous unsustainable activities.<br/><br/>In China, in the 1950s and 1960s the macaques are believed to be quite numerous and very much common in south-eastern Yunnan and in Gunagxi until they became really rare due to the threat of hunting and trapping for traditional medicine.",Decreasing,"<em>Macaca assamensis</em> occurs in Bangladesh, Bhutan, southwestern China (Guangxi, Guizhou, Tibet and Yunnan), northwestern India (Uttarakhand), northeastern India (Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, Tripura, and West Bengal), Lao PDR, Myanmar, Nepal, northwestern Thailand, and northern Viet Nam. It is found from western Nepal east into northern Myanmar and southeast through southernmost China to the upper Mekong in Tibet, and in the east into southern Guizhou to Hoi Xuan in Viet Nam and Thateng in Lao PDR; the range continues south through the Myanmar/Thailand border ranges as far as Chongkrong, as well as to the Sunderbans in Bangladesh. <br/><br/>There is a gap in northeastern India between the two main population pockets, specifically between central Bhutan and the south side of the Brahmaputra; the east bank of its upper course, the Dibang, marks the division between the two subspecies (Groves 2001). More recent studies indicate no gap in the population as the species is found throughout Arunachal Pradesh state, and the Sunderban population requires careful consideration given that only two individuals have been seen in over 140 years with no recent updates on the social media or anywhere on the distribution of the species (Anwaruddin Choudhury in litt., July 2019).<br/><br/><em>Macaca a. assamensis</em> occurs in South and South-east Asia, from 200 to 2,750 m asl, east of Brahmaputra, southwestern China (Southeastern Xizang Autonomous Region Tibet, west and south of Yunnan, south Guizhou, southwestern Guanxi provinces), northeastern India (Eastern Arunachal Pradesh, eastern Assam, Nagaland, Meghalaya, Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura states, south and east through northern, eastern and western Myanmar, northern and western Thailand, Laos and northern Viet Nam.<br/><br/><em>Macaca a. pelops</em> occurs up to 3,100 m in the Himalaya from central Nepal (western limit being Tipling 83°36’ E) through to northeastern India (northern West Bengal, Sikkim, western Assam states, and Bhutan (eastern limit Manas River, 90°58’E) widely ‘disjunct’ and ‘geographic relict’ in Sunderbans, southwestern Bangladesh.","It is hunted for food, 'medicine' and for fashion apparel.",Terrestrial,"<p>This species is listed in Appendix II of CITES (Chetry <em>et</em><em> </em><em>al</em>. 2003).

It exists at a range of population densities and density appears to be highly habitat-specific. The Red Langur may be adaptable, as it is found in a range of forest types, elevations and levels of disturbance. However, population densities above ~800 m asl may be so low as to be non-viable (Marshall 2010). Despite the species’ apparent habitat plasticity, the Red Langur is forest dependent, and is not known to readily use oil palm <span class=""None"">Elaeis guineensis<span class=""None""> plantations. The forests of Borneo are undergoing some of the world’s highest deforestation rates, largely as the result of the expansion of oil palm plantations, and thus such development and consequent loss of habitat, likely constitute the greatest threat to this species. Deforestation is largely occurring in the lowland regions where viable populations exist; remnant forests at elevations above ~800 m asl may not support viable populations, further exacerbating the conservation threat. Furthermore, much remnant habitat is under logging concession (mean 37% across all subspecies; Ehlers-Smith 2014a), which although may maintain as much forest cover as Protected Areas, the loggers may target the tallest trees with the greatest DBH, upon which Red Langurs are dependent for achieving their feeding (Ehlers Smith <em>et al</em>. 2013) and sleeping (Ehlers-Smith 2014b) requirements.</span><br/><br/>This species inhabits the same forests as <em>Hylobates albibarbis</em> and <em>H. muelleri</em> sp of gibbons, both of which are listed as Endangered. Red Langurs<span class=""None""> should be considered Endangered based on an estimated population reduction of over 50% when considering the past 30 years and projected future habitat change due to draining of peat swamps, logging and burning into the next 15 years (totalling 45 years which is approximately 3 generations). Between 2000 and 2010 the species experienced a mean 10% habitat occupancy reduction across all subspecies; <em>P. r. chrysea</em> experienced a ~21% habitat occupancy reduction (Ehlers-Smith 2014a). Where the species persists there is hunting and collection for the wildlife trade and for human consumption. A large part of the species range is in peat swamp - an extremely threatened ecosystem. This species may qualify for Critically Endangered in the future if rates of habitat change increase, and thus should be carefully monitored. While currently unwarranted at the species level (overall <em>P. rubicunda</em> spp still occupy ~270,000 km2) <em>P. r. chysea</em> and <em>P. r. carimatae</em> are candidates for CR at this stage.<br/><br/>In addition, the effectiveness of the protected areas should be considered, as these areas seem to be strongholds for the species. Furthermore, the majority land-use classification for remnant habitat is logging concession, which under selective extraction of the largest trees may further negatively impact their persistence given their reliance on the largest trees in the environment. </span><br/><br/>As the suggested sub-species are genetically unconfirmed, and their ranges uncertain, we feel that assessing the proposed sub-species is not meaningful.

It is also found in swamp forests (Chivers and Burton 1988), and evergreen forests (Davies and Oates 1994). It occasionally visits native gardens in search of food (Yanuar <em>et al</em>. 1993). It is found in primary and secondary lowland forests, not above 2,000 m, and is able to tolerate forests that have regenerated after logging has taken place (Ehlers-Smith and Ehlers-Smith 2013).</span><br/><br/>This colobine species’ annual diet is variable and habitat-specific, dependent upon the availability of fruit (Davies 1991, Ehlers Smith<em> et al</em>. 2013). It may comprise folivory on young leaves (36%), seeds (30%), and combined frugivory on pulpy, seedy fruits and leaves (34%). This diet varies throughout the year as availability of food sources, particularly fruit, shifts (Davies 1991), and there is pronounced frugivory during fruiting periods (Hanya and Bernard 2012; Marshall <em>et al</em>. 2009). In Sabah, a group of <em>P. rubicunda</em> was found to rely on lianas for about 32% of their total diet; the rest were tree species and hemiepiphytes. In Central Kalimantan this species was found to have a very high level of granivory: mean annual diet comprised 76.4% seeds and 7.3% other fruit parts; 7.7% young and 2.5% mature leaves; 2.8% flowers; 2.6% piths, and &lt;1% on other minor food items (Ehlers-Smith <em>et al</em>. 2013).

Oil palm plantations are likely to expand in the future as a result of the push for biofuels, and forest cover on the island of Borneo, if current deforestation rates continue, is projected to decline from 50% to less than one-third by 2020. The species is threatened by hunting for meat and traditional “<span class=""None"">medicine<span class=""None"">”, as well as loss of habitat due to deforestation. Much habitat is being lost to expanding oil palm plantations. Nevertheless, it may be reasonably adaptable, and can occur in some secondary habitats.

Habitat loss was probably between 30-50% of the range in the past 30 years (approximately three generations) and continuing due to settlements, monoculture plantations for wood pulp and palm oil, and oil fields. Where the species does remain it is heavily hunted for ‘bezoar’ stones and meat.","This species occurs in lowland to hill dipterocarp rainforest (on Mount Kinabalu). It is known from sea-level up to approximately 1,000 m elevation, with records to 1,600 m (Goodman, 1989) and possibly higher. Animals occasionally enter plantations.

They are known to eat mud around mineral springs which in due time forms concretions in the stomach called Bezoar stones, believed to be containing medicinal values.<br/><br/>Diurnal and arboreal. Territorial, group living animals with one male, 2-6 females and their young. In Brunei, average group size is six. Male produce spacing vocalizations, relatively simpler than other species’ calls.","<p>Though not totally impervious, Hose’s Sureli is relatively tolerant of forest disturbance. However, hunting poses the biggest danger to this species. The hunting of surelis correlates with the presence of inland settlements, the timber industry, and a demand for lucrative “bezoar stones” (visceral secretions used in traditional “medicines”). These monkeys are also hunted for food and to deter crop raiding (Nijman 2004).<br/><br/>They are relatively tolerant of forest disturbance and light logging but forest destruction and hunting are ongoing threats. In 2010, the forest loss was estimated to be more than 50% due to settlements and primarily monoculture plantations for wood pulp and palm oil. The dry forest floors due to the intensive, selective logging during El Niño years result in forest fires, which are considerably problematic. Only about 50,000 km² of forests remain. Oil fields, between Sarawak and Brunei, hunting for bezoar stones and crop raid deterring, inland settlements and timber industries (both correlate with the langur’s hunting). Bernard <em>et al.</em> (2014) found them in relatively disturbed habitat.</p>","A population in the Kayan Mentarang National Park in East Kalimantan was assessed by counts along transects as well as data from all other encounters. A follow-up census seven years later concluded that densities had dropped by 50-80%, and the species had become rare to observe.

Presently, its population size is estimated to number fewer than 250 mature individuals with a continuing decline.","<p><span class=""None"">This species is presently restricted to limestone karst forest habitat with broadleaf evergreen forests, but with some records from secondary forest in limestone areas as well (Nadler 1996, 2004, 2015; Rowe 1996). <br/><br/>They prefer the karst habitat for several reasons, one being the bowl-like surface of karst habitats that retain rain water. They thrive in such habitats where caves and crevices offer warm shelter during cold winters. They mostly occur in lower elevations of <em>ca</em> 500 m up to 1,000 m asl in Pu Luong Nature Reserve. <br/><br/>Leaves make up most of the diet (80%) therefore they are primarily folivorous, of which 60% constitutes young leaves and 20% mature leaves. They do not eat insects and the leaves those are preferred contain a high protein to fibre ratio (Workman 2010a, 2010b; Workman and Le Van Dung 2009).<span class=""None""><br/><br/>Sexual maturity in male Delacours <em>ca</em> 5 years and females at 4 years. Gestation of 180-196 days. Females typically bear single offspring. Home range of 20-50 ha. Unimale-multifemale type social organization and sometimes, two males are present in the group. In such cases the males are relatives (either father-son or brothers). Typical group size is 10 but the largest group observed is 17 individuals. Bachelor groups of up to four individuals also exist. Inter-group aggression is common and home ranges of groups overlap.</span></p>","<span class=""None"">Hunting for the purposes of traditional ""medicine"" is the primary threat facing this species; most of the populations that survive are heavily reduced and fragmented. Only the subpopulation at Van Long, is thought likely to survive given the current hunting pressure; however, quarrying for limestone (cement), which is currently taking place there, has affected the ranging behavior of the animals (Nadler 2004, 2014). The smallest populations are extremely unlikely to survive should the one reproductively active male be taken or killed (Nadler 2004). Forest loss is a more minor threat as the species occurs in degraded areas. A potential threat is the rapid development of tourist facilities adjacent to protected areas.","<p><span class=""None"">Surveys carried out between 1990 and 2000 resulted in the discovery of 19 subpopulations in a restricted area of northern Viet Nam. Taken from these surveys the total of all populations was estimated at 49-53 groups and 270-302 individuals. In three areas where Delacour’s langur occurred in the past the species was already eradicated by the 1990s, following information provided by local people (Nadler <em>et al</em>. 2003). About half of all discovered populations (10) occurred in unprotected areas. The protection level in protected areas is mostly low, but still under control of the Forest Protection Department. In unprotected areas there is no control over hunting, and the animals are under high pressure.<br/><br/>With additional surveys in the first decade of the 21<sup>st</sup> century the total number of recorded individuals increased slightly. The number of groups is 50-57 and the number of individuals 281-317. The increased total number of langurs resulted in the development of the population in Van Long Nature Reserve, the area under special protection through the Vietnam Primate Conservation Program of Frankfurt Zoological Society, which included additional education and awareness programs for the surrounding communes of the area. The distribution of animals within subpopulations during this period indicates a reduction in the occurrence of larger populations compared to the previous decade (Nadler 2004; 2015). During this decade a number of small populations were eradicated. The exact years of extirpation cannot be verified. The information is based on interview surveys of local villagers, who indicated that the last sighting or record of the species was often several years ago. Therefore, these small populations are believed to be eradicated.<br/><br/>Surveys were carried out between 2012 and 2015 by the Endangered Primate Rescue Center and Forestry University Hanoi to verify the current situation of the species. The results of the surveys in all known subpopulations shows a dramatic decline compared to the last decade. The total number is estimated at 234-275 individuals. The majority occurs in Van Long Nature Reserve and if the population of the nature reserve is combined with the adjacent planned extension area to count as one population, the total for the area is 164-191 individuals. The remaining 70-84 individuals occur in the additional seven areas. Not one of these populations has a size which can guarantee a secure future, even if hunting could be eliminated. The problem of inbreeding for these small populations is not relevant. Before the inbreeding coefficient increases over a certain level, the populations will be extinct through other pressures.<span class=""None""><br/><br/>The results of the surveys clearly illustrate the dire situation for the species and the extreme value of Van Long Nature Reserve as the last and only refuge for the survival of the species.</span></p>",Decreasing,"This species is endemic to Viet Nam and occurs in a very restricted area of north-central Viet Nam that totals about 5,000 km². The distribution of subpopulations and smaller social groups is closely related to the series of limestone mountain ranges in the provinces of Ninh Binh, Nam Ha, Hoa Binh, and Thanh Hoa (Nadler <em>et al.</em> 2003, 2004, 2015; Nadler and Brockman 2014). The area of occupancy (AOO) for this species prior to 2000 was only about 400 km² but with eradication of several populations the AOO is currently smaller than 300 km² (Nadler 2015).","The species is hunted primarily for the purposes of traditional ""medicine"", but also for food and occasionally for the pet trade.",Terrestrial,"<p><span class=""None"">This species is currently listed in CITES Appendix II. It is considered 'critically endangered' in Viet Nam, and is listed under the highest protection level in Decree 32/2006, and as species for special conservation considerations in Decree 160/2013. It occurs in six protected areas. Van Long Nature Reserve was established for conservation of this species in 2001, and there has been evidence of population growth in this reserve in the past 15 years.<br/><br/>The primary focus of conservation activities for the species should be the protection of all remaining populations. But this is far from the reality. The protection of areas without current protection status - which are three areas - is not feasible. To apply for a protection status and establish strong protection for an area is not a viable option for such extremely small populations with little chance of ever developing into viable populations. These populations will be eradicated and disappear in the near future. The most efficient option to stabilize the largest existing population in Van Long Nature reserve and to save sufficient habitat for the long-term existence of a viable population would be the extension of the reserve. <br/><br/>Translocation of isolated groups of animals or small populations from areas under pressure or for improving the genetic pool of a larger population is undoubtedly an important conservation tool for many species. The most critical point is the method with which to catch the animals in the areas which are often very difficult to access. One way is netting of the animals in a cave, a sleeping place which the animals occasionally or preferentially use in the winter season. Special caves and cracks in the limestone outcrops are often used consistently by generations of animals in one group. But groups which use easily accessible caves are as a consequence of easy access, are already wiped out by hunters and the remaining sleeping places are very difficult to access. Currently, there is no other proven technique for capturing animals in the difficult terrain that constitutes their natural habitat. A well-trained team with substantial financial and technical support would be necessary to develop a technique to safely capture animals in the wild.<br/><br/>A basis for reintroduction is the captive population of Delacour’s langur at the Endangered Primate Rescue Center. In 2011 a first pilot project was conducted with the reintroduction of three captive born individuals into Van Long Nature Reserve (Agmen 2014, Nadler 2012). Based on the successful result a second reintroduction took place in November 2012, also in Van Long Nature Reserve (Elser 2013, Elser <em>et al.</em> 2015). The programs have been very positively received by villagers and the awareness about protection of the species in the communes surrounding the nature reserve is very high. This has resulted in the long-term success of the Frankfurt Zoological Society conservation project and the strong involvement of local villagers and guards of the community protection unit in protection and conservation activities (Elser and Nguyen Hong Chung 2013).<span class=""None""><br/><br/>From a conservation point of view, the establishment of a second population would be a preferable option in order to secure the long-term existence of the species. With a search of possible areas, only the newly nominated World Heritage Site “Trang An Scenic Landscape Complex” could provide a suitable habitat for a newly established population, and this is in planning.</span></p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

In Vietnam Ha Tinh Langurs are usually found in limestone areas with dense forest cover such as the habitat in Phong Nha – Ke Bang National Park. They prefer caves and cliffs as sleeping sites, locations that are thought to provide protection from predators (including humans). According to Nadler (2013) cliffs that are used as sleeping sites range from 20 to 60 m in height and specific sleeping sites can sometimes be identified by dark yellow and brown marks that occur directly below cause by urine and feces of the resting Langurs. In Lao PDR, the species is associated with both limestone and non-limestone rock outcrops on steep or precipitous mountain slopes.&#160; Some of this habitat is less heavily forested than that of Vietnam (Duckworth<em> et al.</em> 2010).&#160; Ha Tinh Langurs have been reported in areas of up to 1,500 m asl. <br/><br/>This species is highly folivorous; a feeding study in a semi-natural 20 ha enclosed area in Phong Nha – Ke Bang reported a diet consisting of 81% leaves, 9% fruit, 9% vines, and 1% flowers (Nadler and Brockman 2014, Nguyen Van Truong 2013). This species is primarily arboreal but also spends time on steep karst cliffs and mountain sides (Haus <em>et al.</em> 2009, Nadler <em>et al.</em> 2003, Nguyen Manh Ha 2006). <br/><br/>Ha Tinh Langurs are usually observed in one male – multifemale groups with average group sizes between 6 and 8 individuals although the largest observed group included 30 individuals (Pham Nhat 2002, Nguyen Manh Ha 2006). Births occur through the year but peak in January-June after a gestation of 180-190 days (Nadler and Brockman 2014). <span class=""None""></span></p>","<span class=""None"">The main threat to this species is hunting, as shooting of primates is quite common throughout its range (Duckworth<em> et al</em>. 2010, Nadler <em>et al</em>. 2003). The animals are killed for meat, as well as for traditional “medicine” and the wildlife trade (Nadler <em>et al.</em> 2003, Nguyen Manh Ha 2006). Snaring is reported to be the predominant hunting method in Phong Nha-Ke Bang (Timmins <em>et al</em>. 1999), with an increase since 1996 (Nadler <em>et al</em>. 2003). Hunting with rifles has appeared to diminish since 1995, probably due to gun legislation controls, confiscation of guns by local authorities, and a decrease of hunting success (Nadler <em>et al.</em> 2003). Road construction around Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park has increased hunting and illegal logging (Nadler <em>et al.</em> 2003). Habitat loss is also a problem in some areas (Nguyen Manh Ha 2006). Road construction in Lao PDR within the Langur’s geographic range is also providing easier access for hunters (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 2010).","There is no reliable global population estimate available for this species.<br/><br/>The Phong Nha-Khe Bang area of Quang Binh Province has the largest remaining single population of Ha Tinh Langurs in Viet Nam. Population estimates for the Phong Nha-Khe Bang area have varied over the past two decades; Le Xuan Canh <em>et al</em>. (1997) offered an estimate of 520-750 individuals, Pham Nhat (2002) suggested a maximum of 800, Haus <em>et al</em>. (2009) offered an estimate of 2,143 (± 467) while Nguyen Van Truong (2013) estimated only 150 individuals remained in 2009. It is clear that an updated survey is needed. Tran Huu Vy (2013) reported that approximately 50 individuals occur in Ke Go Nature Reserve, Nguyen Manh Ha (2006) reported that at least 30 individuals occur in Khe Net Nature Reserve in Quang Binh Province, and this species also occurs in Bac Hoang Hoa Nature Reserve in Quang Tri Province (Nguyen Ai Tam, 2012, Nadler and Brockman, 2014).<br/><br/>In Lao PDR they occur in Nakai-Nam Theun, Hin Nambo, and possibly the southern portion of Phou Hinpoun National Conservation Areas but population estimates are lacking.",Decreasing,"The Ha Tinh Langur occurs in limestone areas in north central Viet Nam (the western part of Ha Tinh, Quang Binh and Quang Tri Provinces from 18°00’N, 105°50’E south to 16°10’N, 107°40’E), and in east central Lao PDR (eastern part of Khammouan and Savannakhet Provinces) (Nadler <em>et al</em>. 2003, Nadler 2013, Nadler and Brockman 2014) and it possibly overlaps with <em>Trachypithecus laotum</em> in the latter province.

The entire population exists on Cat Ba Island, where it has a small range that is prone to habitat impacts from threats of fires, tourism and development.","<p><span class=""None"">This species is associated with forests on limestone (karst) hills. The caves found in this habitat are thought to offer protection from predators and temperature extremes but, if accessible to people, this habitat is also where human hunters capture or kill sleeping Langurs (Nadler <em>et al</em>., 2003). It is arboreal and terrestrial, and diurnal and mildly crepuscular. Like other Langurs, this species is mainly folivorous, with leaves making up between 75-87% of its diet; the rest is composed of fruit, flowers, and stems (Hendershott <em>et al.,</em>&#160;in prep.). Forty-two families of plants with 98 plant species have been reported to constitute their diet. Social composition is unimale-multifemale groups with and, despite the small number of animals remaining, bachelor bands composed of several males have been identified (Luu Tuong Bach and Le Van Dung, 2013).

Reproductively valuable males were often the most common victims due to their behavior (Stenke and Chu Xuan Canh, 2004).&#160;This is highly questionable, however,&#160;as their behaviour is not enormously different and, if anything, females would be easier to hunt as they are often grouped together and there are more of them per group (Leonard Neahga in litt., 31 October 2019).<br/><br/>Hunting for meat seems to have happened rarely due to the reputed poor taste of langur meat.<br/><br/>Habitat disturbance and fragmentation resulting from the growing human population on Cat Ba Island (due in large part to the country's designation of the island as a new tourism center for northern Viet Nam), and rampant fires due to honey collectors (Nadler and Long, 2000) are also threats.<br/><br/>Poorly regulated tourism in the inadequately managed Cat Ba National Park has direct effects on langur natural history, such as the disturbance to habitat in the karst archipelago where these monkeys live. The small size and fragmented nature of the remaining Cat Ba Langur population means that the species is at risk of inbreeding effects (or intrinsic effects to avoid inbreeding by not breeding at all), extremely limited mate-choice due to the small number of available females, and the chance of a natural or human disaster causing total or effective extinction. However, according to&#160;Leonard Neahga (in litt., 31 October 2019) the population would have been very small even at its peak, and would have been small for the last 12,000 years when the langurs were confined to Cat Ba as a result of rising sea levels. It is unlikely that the population was ever above 4-5,000 individuals at any point over the last 12,000 years.&#160;This suggests that major inbreeding effects would have already happened in the deep past and, potentially, been weeded out.&#160;The threat of disease remains a major concern.<br/><br/>The presence of a group of non-native macaques on a nearby tourist island that have extensive daily contact with humans is a cause for concern due to the potential of escape and disease transmission. &#160;</p>","<p><span class=""None"">The confirmed population of <em>Trachypithecus poliocephalus</em> in June 2016 was 51-54 individuals (30-35 mature individuals), a sharp drop from was 64-70 as of November 2015 (CBLCP unpublished information).&#160;<span class=""None"">As of this update the reason for this drop appears to have been poaching by people from the neighbouring province (Neahga Leonard in litt., 31 October 2019).&#160;Previously published population numbers contain errors and a reevaluation of observation records indicates that in 2000 the population totalled between 40 and 53 animals. Records indicate that in 2003 the count was 40 confirmed animals, reaching 48 by 2010, and 56 by early 2014 (Leonard&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015). Exact counts are difficult as some groups remain in inaccessible areas and are rarely seen.<br/><br/>Previous population counts were not given at a regular time on the year, resulting in the appearance of a much greater fluctuation in population than is actually the case.&#160;&#160;A January 01 population count from 2001-2019 based on CBLCP records removes some variation in previous population counts: 2000 47; 2001 47; 2002 40; 2003 40; 2004 40; 2005 43; 2006 46; 2007 47; 2008 48; 2009 49; 2010 48; 2011 50; 2012 49; 2013 53; 2014 56; 2015 59; 2016 53; 2017 55; 2018 57; 2019 60 (CBLCP unpublished information).

Group size averages 5.9 to 6.5 animals, based on the October 2019 population of 67 individuals in 10-11 groups. Within each subpopulation some groups are single sex and there are several cases of solitary animals, usually male.&#160;&#160;Average population growth is 2-3% per year with year-by-year variation from -10% to +8% (CBLCP unpublished information).<br/><br/>The population declined to an estimated 500-600 langurs in 1970-1986 from an estimated 2,400-2,700 langurs that appears to have thrived in the ‘optimal’ karst habitat (Nadler and Long 2000).

The Cua Dong population was most at risk with a 40.5% risk of extinction at the worst case scenario over 100 years. The low reproductive rate and low carrying capacity of the site increase the probability of extinction. The captive population ran a very high extinction risk of 100% in the worst case and 95% in the best case (or ‘optimistic’) over 50 years, owing to the susceptibility of the population to inbreeding and due to small population size.<br/><br/>Births per year have been steadily increasing, with approximately 30% of the reproductively active females giving birth per year from 2014 until present (2019) except for 2016.

Other threats facing these populations include pollution, inbreeding, and a local trade in the animals for zoos and as food (Molur <em>et al.&#160;</em>2003).

Further to the east of the range (in China, Viet Nam, Thailand, and Lao PDR), the major threat is hunting for traditional “medicine” and bushmeat. Indeed, in northern Thailand they have been nearly entirely hunted out, and now only survive in larger protected areas. In the known Lao PDR stronghold for this species (Bolikhamsai province), there is extensive infrastructure development for hydro-electric power, which is likely to increase hunting pressure on these populations (R. Timmins pers. comm). Furthermore, the range of the species in Viet Nam, Lao PDR and Thailand coincides with ethnic minorities that favour shifting cultivation, with a continual resulting loss of forest (R. Timmins pers. comm).","In India and Bangladesh, populations are small and isolated, though the species is locally common in many places (Choudhury 2001, Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>In Lao PDR the species is localized, and in the northern parts of its range, it is generally scarce due to both high hunting pressure and a high level of habitat fragmentation. In the southern parts of its range in Lao PDR, the species is more common, although still among the scarcest of the diurnal primates (R.Timmins pers. comm.).<br/><br/>In Viet Nam the species is rare and now very localized (R. Timmins pers. comm). Over the ten years prior to 2004, there were records only from a handful of areas (Nadler <em>et al.</em> 2004).<br/><br/>In Thailand, there are good populations in Nam Nao National Park and Phukhio Wildlife Sanctuary, where they had the highest densities at 3.4 groups/km² and 23-38 individuals/km² (Borries <em>et al.&#160;</em>2002), but much of northern Thailand has been hunted out. There are also good populations in the Western Forest complex (W. Brockelmann pers. comm).<br/><br/>There is little information available concerning the species’ status in Myanmar (R. Timmins pers. comm).<br/><br/>In China, in 2002 it was reported that healthy populations of&#160;<em>Trachypithecus phayrei</em><em>&#160;shanicus</em> survive mainly in Gaoligongshan Nature Reserve and Tongbiguan Nature Reserve, and healthy populations of <em>T. p. crepuscula</em> survive mainly in Nangunhe Nature Reserve, Ailaoshan Nature Reserve, Wuliangshan Nature Reserve, Daxueshan Nature Reserve, Huanlianshan Nature Reserve, and Xishuanbanna Nature Reserve (Zhang <em>et al</em>. 2002).

Habitat loss from agriculture and wood extraction is a major threat. A large length of the Chindwin (where the species was discovered) and its adjacent plains are scheduled to be inundated by the Tazone hydro-electric power dam (currently on hold). As well as direct loss of habitat through inundation this will result in massive increases in hunting as the construction labourers will be expected to live off the land, and the reservoir formed will greatly increase accessibility to a huge area of foothill forest; without specific, directed, management, hunters will no doubt take advantage of this. Habitat loss is severe habitats below 900 m in Myanmar, where degradation and fragmentation are ongoing. Hence, the species is suspected to decline at the same rate in the future also unless measures are taken to halt the trend.","This species occurs primarily in evergreen and semi-evergreen forests. It is largely arboreal, sometimes terrestrial, and folivorous. Records with known altitudes range from 200 to 2,500 m (Pocock, 1939) but it is possible that the species does not have viable populations in the upper 600-1,200 m of this range: collecting expeditions very rarely encountered it in the highlands, compared with its evident abundance in the Chindwin lowlands.

It has also been noted in bamboo “brakes” and hollock (<em>Terminalia myriocarpa</em>) and ajhar (<em>Largerstroemia flosreginae</em>) plantations. One gibbon pair in the Borajan Reserved Forest (north-east India) was observed to habitually descend from the trees to move over scrub and short bamboo especially while trying to reach the isolated food trees inside a village. This pair was found sleeping at heights of 0 m or less in bamboo clumps (Kakati 1997). Although gibbons may be moving through, or sleeping in, bamboo forest or plantations, they cannot survive in monocultures (W. Brockleman pers. comm.). Additionally, the species has been observed in two plains forest locations (Choudhury 1991). Its preferred habitat, however, is dense evergreen and semi-evergreen forests (Choudhury 2001). It has been recorded at altitudes of up to 2,500 m in Manipur, northeast India (Choudhury 2001).<br/><br/>Home ranges in most populations range from 8-63 ha (Ahsan 2001, Alfred and Sati 1990, Muzaffar <em>et al</em>. 2007,&#160; Feeroz and Islam 1992,&#160; Islam and Feeroz 1992; Islam and Feeroz 1992a, Kakati 2000, Mukherjee 1996, Tilson 1979), but unusually large home ranges of 200-400 ha were reported from Tripura and Arunachal Pradesh, northeast India (Mukherjee 19<em>96</em>). The western hoolock is a frugivorous species, with ripe fruits composing a majority of its diet (Ahsan 2001, Alfred and Sati 1990, Bin Muzaffar <em>et al.</em> 2007,&#160; Feeroz and Islam 1992, Islam and Feeroz 1992a&#160; Kakati 2000, Mukherjee 1996, Tilson 1979). A dominantly folivorous diet was reported during studies carried out in Assam’s Borajan Reserved Forest and in Tripura (Kakati 2000, Mukherjee 1996), and gibbons living in small forest fragments were observed to experience a period of almost total lack of fruit in their diet at the end of the dry season (Kakati 2000, Mukherjee 1996). Low fruit availability may contribute to the relatively large home range sizes of some populations. In northeast India, the hoolock gibbon is recognized as being an important disperser of undigested seeds from large and small fruit-bearing trees (Das <em>et al</em>. 2005).","In Bangladesh, the main threats are the combined effects of habitat loss, fragmentation, human interference and hunting (Islam and Feeroz 1992, Molur <em>et al.</em> 2005). Hunting is universal all over Bangladesh as well as India, and may be in Myanmar also. In China, the Tibetan population could be under threat from hunting for food or non-targeted hunting, but this is not established.<br/><br/>In some Indian locales, these animals are rare due to large scale hunting for food and because some ethnic groups believe the gibbons have medicinal properties (Gupta 2005, J. Das pers. comm). On the other hand, observations from Arunachal Pradesh (P.C. Ray pers. comm.) suggest that hoolocks are not hunted for subsistence, and may even be cherished. Density of gibbons is still high around tribal villages of several ethnic groups; the same is true in northern Myanmar. Additionally, jhoom cultivation threatens the habitats of Indian populations, some of which are relatively isolated already (Choudhury 1991). Affecting all northeastern Indian primate populations are harvesting of bamboo for paper mills, oil mining and exploration, and coal mining, which deplete habitat and cause pollution and disturbance (Choudhury 1991). Habitat fragmentation and loss are major threats in India (Kakati 2000). Small and restricted groups may not be viable because of genetic and demographic instabilities and because they are more affected by hunting pressure and habitat loss. Many small forest fragments are reported to have only one or a few gibbon groups. These have limited chances of surviving more than a few generations without translocation (Campbell <em>et al.</em> 2015, Das <em>et al.</em> 2010).<br/><br/>In Myanmar, shifting cultivation is a major threat, and so is hunting. Although logging is restricted on the western side of the Chindwin, it is still considered a threat for this species (Geissmann <em>et al</em>. 2013). Political and ethnic conflicts have prevented the Myanmar government from promoting development and conservation activities effectively in areas of northwestern and central western Myanmar along the borders with India and Bangladesh. Thus, most conservation efforts have been concentrated within the range of <em>Hoolock leuconedys</em>.","There are estimated to be about 200-280 hoolocks in Bangladesh (Islam <em>et al.</em> 2006, Molur <em>et al</em>. 2005). In China, a population has been identified in Medog Nature Reserve in southeastern Tibet, just across the border from Arunachal Pradesh, but the identity of this taxon is not established and there has been no survey conducted to determine the population numbers (W. Bleisch pers. comm).<br/><br/>This species occurs in several of India’s northeastern states, but populations there tend to be isolated. It is common in certain areas of occurrence, but rare in others due to intense hunting by local tribes (Choudhury 1991), and is considered rare throughout its range (Choudhury 2001). The species was found in all forested patches in northeastern India about 30 years ago, but they are reduced to a few forest fragments now. The total population in northeastern India is now estimated to be over 12,000, of which about 2,000 occur in the state of Assam (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2005), and most of the remainder in Arunachal Pradesh. A population of about 170 gibbons has more recently been identified as <em>H. leuconedys</em> (Das <em>et al</em>. 2006) and should be subtracted from the population estimate if this identity is proven. Moreover, there are surveys needed in Mehao region, where there is uncertainty as to which species the gibbons there represent (Das <em>et al.</em> 2006, Das pers. comm). Namdapha National Park in the Changlang District of Arunachal Pradesh is a relative stronghold for this species in India, offering the population there its largest contiguous stretch of protected habitat (Chetry <em>et al.</em> 2003).&#160;Recent surveys by Ray <em>et al.</em> (2015) using auditory methods have revealed high average densities of 3.47 groups per km² in the northern part of Namdapha National Park, which would yield projections of the total population in the park of over 15,000. However, caution is advised, as further surveys in the central and southern parts of the park are needed, and are ongoing.<br/><br/>There are no population estimates available for Myanmar. It is possible that the largest and most viable populations of western hoolock are to be found in this country, where at present almost no attention is paid to it (W. Brockelman pers. comm). There are several thousand square kilometres of unsurveyed forest habitat in the central-west and north-west of this country, with a particular need to survey the western areas west of Chindwin/Ayerawady River. There are reports of gibbons in Rakhine Yoma Elephant Range, but there is no knowledge of the actual population level there (W. Brockelman pers. comm. 2006). The western part of Hukuang Tiger Reserve with a large area of forest (&gt;1,000 km²) has not been surveyed, but is likely to have this species. The northern limit is just south of Hkakaraborazi National Park.",Decreasing,"This species is found in eastern Bangladesh, northeastern India (Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, and Tripura), and northwestern Myanmar (west of the Chindwin River). It might possibly occur in China (extreme southeastern Tibet). The distribution in India is restricted to points south of the Brahmaputra and east of the Dibang (Dingba Qu) Rivers (Choudhury 2001). Animals that once were common in the plains of Arunachal Pradesh (northeasternmost India) before that habitat was cultivated for agriculture and tea are not so any more (Islam and Feeroz 1992).<br/><br/>The boundary between the two species of <em>Hoolock</em> is the Chindwin River, which flows into the Ayerawady (Irrawady) River. At the headwaters in the north there is a hybrid zone or cline between the two species (since they are almost certainly not reproductively isolated). Das <em>et al</em>. (2006) reported the discovery of a population of <em>Hoolock leuconedys</em> in Arunachal Pradesh, northeast India, which has traditionally been considered to be part of the range of <em>H. hoolock</em>.",This species is hunted for food throughout most of its range.

The population has declined to around 2,000 individuals occurring in small, isolated populations of 1-29 groups. A continuing decline over the next 45 years, at the same rate, is predicted, primarily due to hunting and habitat loss (Fan <em>et al</em>. 2009, Li <em>et al</em>. 2011).

Population estimates for the Chinese portion of this species range from about 270 to 300 groups with the most important subpopulations in China residing in the Wuliang and Ailao Mountains (Bleisch and Chen 1991; Peng-Fei <em>et al</em>. 2009; Jiang <em>et al</em>. 2006). Ninety eight groups were reported in the Wuliang Mountains (Haimoff <em>et al</em>. 1986; Jiang <em>et al</em>. 2006; Lan 1993), but a later survey just confirmed 87 groups (Luo 2011). A small population with about four groups was found in Jinggu County recently (H. Bei pers. comm). Most groups found in the Wuliang Mountains live in stable bi-female groups with an average group size of 6.2 individuals (Fan <em>et al</em>. 2006), therefore, the total population in the Wuliang Mountains is estimated to be 500-600 individuals (if an average group size of six individuals is used). In the Ailao Mountains, approximately 180 groups persist in six counties with 124 groups in Xinping, 11 groups in Chuxiong, 2 groups in Nanhua, 26 groups in Shuangbai, 9 groups in Jingdong, and 9 groups in Zhenyuan (Sun <em>et al</em>. 2012); with around 680-720 individuals (if an average group size of four individuals per group is used). In southern Yunnan there are possibly three areas where this species occurs, in Bajiaohe, Jingping County (two groups recorded), Fenshuiling Nature Reserve (possibly 1-2 groups, but not confirmed), and Huanglianshan Nature Reserve (possibly 1-3 groups, but not confirmed (Ni and Ma 2006). The total population in southern Yunnan was estimated to less than 25 individuals (Ni and Ma 2006). On the west bank of Mekong River, there are two sites with confirmed records; three groups in Yongde Daxueshan Nature Reserve (Sun <em>et al</em>. 2012) and two groups in Xuezhulingdashan. This population, formerly recognized as <em>Nomascus concolor furvogaster</em>, is on the edge of extinction.<br/><br/>The population of <em>N. c. concolor</em> in Viet Nam consists of only 22–25 groups, with <em>ca.</em> 20 groups in the contiguous Mu Cang Chai Species Habitat Conservation Area, Yen Bai Province and Muong La forests, Son La Province and only 2–5 groups in Van Ban Nature Reserve (Haimoff <em>et al</em>. 1986; Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011; Tien 1983). In Van Nan, the population is likely decreasing and in Muong La/Mu Cang Chai it has stabilized in recent years (Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>The population of <em>N. c. lu</em> in Lao PDR is, likewise, heavily suppressed and is known to occur in only two areas: Nam Kan NPA and Nam Ha NPA (MAF 2011). In Nam Kan NPA, in the most recent and comprehensive surveys, only three localities were found to still hold gibbons, with 10 gibbon groups heard and 39 individuals observed. This suggests that the largest Lao PDR population is small and vulnerable; the study documented some locations previously known to have gibbons no longer did. The core population is centred around an ecotourism project which, together with local taboos against hunting, provides protection for this small population (Youanechuexian <em>et al</em>. 2014).",Decreasing,"The species as a whole occurs discontinuously in southwestern China, northwestern Lao PDR and northern Viet Nam (Geissmann <em>et al</em>. 2000). One thousand years ago, gibbons that may have been crested gibbons (genus <em>Nomascus</em>) were distributed over a large part of southern and central China up to the Yellow River (Geissmann 1995, Luo 2011, Zhou <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/><strong><em>Nomascus concolor concolor</em></strong><br/>This subspecies occurs in southern China (central and southwestern Yunnan) and northern Viet Nam (Lao Cai, Yen Bai, Son La, and Lai Chau provinces) (Geissmann <em>et al</em>. 2000). It is found between the Salween (Nujiang) and Song Hong (Red) Rivers, north to 23°45'N and south to about 20°N (Groves 2001).<br/><br/><strong><em>Nomascus concolor lu</em></strong><br/>This subspecies occurs in northwestern Lao PDR. An isolated population, it is known for certain only in a tiny area in on the east bank of the Mekong at about 20°17'-20°25'N (Groves 2001). It is confirmed in Nam Ha NPA, Luang Namtha province, and in the Nam Kan NPA, Bokeo province (Timmins and Duckworth 2013).","<p>In Lao PDR, despite the presence of local taboos on hunting gibbons in some area (Geissmann 2007; Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011; Youanechuexian 2014) these animals are captured and killed for subsistence as well as the pet and ""medicine"" trades.</p>",Terrestrial,"This species is listed in CITES Appendix I. It is legally protected in Viet Nam (Appendix 1B of Decree 32, 2006) and in Lao PDR (‘Prohibition’ category in the list of protected species) and in China as a Class I Protected Animal under the Chinese Wildlife Conservation Law.<br/><br/>In China, about three-quarters of the Wuliang Mountain population's range is protected, much of it within the Wuliang Mountain Nature Reserve and Ailao Mountain Nature Reserve; the species occurs as well in Huanglianshan Nature Reserve, Fenshuilin Nature Reserve, Daxueshan Nature Reserve, Nanguanhe Nature Reserve, Lancangjiang Nature Reserve (Geissmann <em>et al</em>. 2000; Fan 2017).<br/><br/>The Vietnamese population in Mu Cang Chai SHCA/Muong La has been under conservation management by Fauna &amp; Flora International since the late 1990s, with some success. While the population has undergone some sporadic declines since that time, other unprotected areas (notably Van Ban NR) have undergone precipitous declines when protections have been removed (Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011). These sites are protected by local conservation teams and a co-management mechanism has been put into place to allow local communities to work with protected area authorities, in order to mitigate impacts to wildlife and forests (Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>In Lao PDR, Nam Kan NPA is identified as the only remaining population warranting conservation intervention. This population is partially protected by an ecotourism project, the Gibbon Experience, which funds forest patrols and provides revenue to local communities, reducing risks to the resident population (MAF 2011).",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

Declining populations are due to the significant and ongoing threats of hunting, live capture and forest loss. The two countries in which this species occurs, Viet Nam and Lao PDR, have already lost significant tropical forest cover this century, and will likely lose substantially more should current deforestation rates continue over the next few decades. Since 2004, according to Global Forest Watch statistics, Viet Nam lost approximately  15% of its forest cover in the last 15 years (one generation)  and could conceivably  lose an additional 45% or more in the next 30 years (two generations). The situation in Lao PDR is similar: a 15% loss of forest cover from  2004-2018 and a potential 50% overall loss of forest cover (or greater)  as we approach the year 2050.&#160;&#160;&#160;  <br/></p>","<p>  </p><p>  </p><p><em>Nomascus siki</em> lives in tall primary broadleaf evergreen forest and, at least historically, was found between elevations of 30 to 1,900 m in a typical wet tropical climate, with no influence of the northeast monsoon and no conspicuous dry season (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1995; Timmins and Duckworth 2013; Ujhelyi <em>et al.</em> 2000; N.M. Ha pers. comm.). Conversion of lowland forest means they are no longer found at lower elevations in Viet Nam where their primary habitat is evergreen forest from 300-1,000 m (N.M. Ha pers. comm.). In Lao PDR, gibbons are found from the Mekong plains up to 1,900 m in Nakai Nam Theun National Biodiversity Conservation Area (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1995; Timmins and Duckworth 2013). The species is found in both limestone and non-limestone forests (N.M. Ha pers. comm.), and may have higher densities in the later based on observations around Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park (Dat <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>Gibbons are strictly arboreal, diurnal and mainly frugivorous (Geissmann <em>et al.</em> 2000)<em></em>, but there are very few field data on the behavioral ecology of <em>N. siki</em>. Ruppell (2013) recorded an activity budget including resting (30%), feeding (33%), travelling (35%), and singing (2%) and an average home range of 37.9 hectares, with a day range of 1.48 km per day. Average group size is unknown except for a few records suggesting they live in monogamous groups of one male, one female with offspring. They start the day with loud vocalizations.</p>","<p>Hunting, in particular, is a major threat in both Viet Nam and Lao PDR where they are used both in traditional “medicine,” for food, and in the pet trade (Duckworth 2008; Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1995; Geissmann <em>et al</em>. 2000; Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011). Hunting of gibbons with guns is often opportunistic rather than specifically targeted at gibbons (Duckworth 2008; Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1995; Geissmann <em>et al.</em> 2000; Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011). Unlike in Lao PDR, the forest habitat of <em>Nomascus siki</em> in Viet Nam is heavily fragmented due to the human pressures of deforestation and agricultural encroachment which, when coupled with hunting, are resulting in populations becoming small, isolated and potentially unviable in many locations (Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011). Hunting continues to be a significant threat to gibbons in Lao PDR, with increased access through infrastructure development opening up areas with previously relatively secure gibbon populations (Duckworth 2008). Currently, large areas of available habitat and availability of higher value species for exploitation mean that <em>N. siki</em> is relatively secure in Lao PDR, however it is expected that declines will continue at high rates due to lack of genuine protection activities in most areas (Duckworth 2008).<br/><br/>Habitat loss has negatively impacted past gibbon generations and could become a more significant threat in future years. According to Global Forest Watch statistics, Viet Nam lost approximately 15% of its forest cover in the last 15 years (one generation) and, should current rates of deforestation continue, could conceivably lose an additional 45% or more in the next 30 years (two generations). The situation in Lao PDR is similar, a 15% loss of forest cover from 2004-2018 and a potential 50% overall loss of forest cover (or greater) as we approach the year 2050.&#160;&#160;</p>","<p>  </p><p>In Viet Nam, the species has been surveyed at some level for all major areas of occurrence since 2000, with no recorded extirpations since that time, although populations appear to be small and in continuing decline because of hunting and habitat loss (Rawson <em>et al.</em> 2011). Rawson <em>et al</em>. (2011) identified key sites for conservation including two large forest complexes, the Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park-Truong Son State Forest Enterprise and Khe Giua State Forest Enterprise-Bac Huong Hoa Nature Reserve complexes. Surveys across the species' range in Viet Nam suggest that these areas support most of the known <em>N. siki </em>population in the country. Importantly, these areas are contiguous with forest in Laos where <em>N. siki </em>populations may be more robust. Sites that have recorded <em>N. siki</em> since 2000, along with minimum confirmed numbers of groups, were summarized by Rawson <em>et al.</em> (2011) and include: Khe Ve Proposed Nature Reserve - ≥ 7 groups; Giang Man Proposed Nature Reserve - ≥ 5 groups; Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park - ≥ 50 groups; Truong Son State Forest Enterprise - ≥ 10 groups; Khe Giua State Forest Enterprise ≥ 4 groups; Bac Huong Hoa Nature Reserve - ≥ 23 groups. While these surveys do not represent full counts of the gibbon populations at these sites, it is clear that many populations are small and isolated.<br/><br/>In Lao PDR, population estimates are generally lacking, but the species is more common than in Viet Nam, and represents the majority of the global population (Duckworth<em> et al.</em> 1999; Duckworth 2008). In Nakai-Nam Theun NPA, population density has been estimated at 1 to 3 groups/km<sup>2</sup> in a 120 km<sup>2</sup> area in the central part of the NPA (Coudrat and Nanthavong 2014). In Hin Nam No NPA, Phiapalath (2009) documented a relative abundance of 0.03 groups/km of reconnaissance trails walked with an average group size of 3.8 individuals, while, in Phou Hin Poun NPA, Phiapalath <em>et al</em>. (2012) estimated an abundance of 0.37 groups/km and an average group size of 3.6. The species is known from Nam Kading, Nakai Nam Theun, Hin Nam No and Phou Hinpoun National Protected Areas, although given the uncertainty of its distribution range to the south this may be an incomplete list.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>This species occurs in central Lao PDR, east of the Mekong River, and central Viet Nam (Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011). The limits of distribution of this species have been significantly reduced after the the description of <em>Nomascus annamensis</em> to the south (Thinh<em> et al</em>. 2010), which is now recognized to include much of the formerly recognized range of <em>N. siki</em>. The species distribution limits are not finally settled, both with regards to <em>N. annamensis</em> in the south and <em>N. leucogenys</em> in the north. The northern limit of the species might be the Kading River in Laos and the Rao Nay River in Vietnam (Thinh <em>et al</em>. 2010a, 2010b). The southern limit of the species in Lao PDR is unknown, but the Banghiang River could be a possible natural barrier. In Viet Nam, the species occurs in parts of Ha Tinh, Quang Binh and Quang Tri Provinces (Rawson&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011) with the southern limit as the Thach Han River (Thinh <em>et al</em>. 2010a, 2010b). It has been suggested that there may be some range overlap between <em>N. siki</em> and <em>N. annamensis</em> in Quang Tri province (N.M. Ha pers. comm.). Importantly, these areas are contiguous with forest in Lao PDR where <em>N. siki </em>populations may be more robust.</p>","Hunting, in particular, is a major threat to this species, in both Viet Nam and Lao PDR, where it is used both in traditional “medicine,” for food, and in the pet trade (Duckworth 2008; Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1995; Geissmann<em> et al.</em> 2000; Rawson <em>et al.</em> 2011).",Terrestrial,"<p>  </p><p>This species is listed on CITES Appendix I and is legally protected in Viet Nam (Appendix 1b of Decree 32, 2006) and in Lao PDR (Category 1 protected species in accordance with the Wildlife Law (2007) and Decree 81/PM of 2008). In Viet Nam, the species is assessed as EN in the Viet Nam Red Data Book (2007) but has been proposed for uplisting to CR under criteria A1cd (Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011). In Viet Nam, it has been recorded in six sites including two protected areas; Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park and Bac Huong Hoa Nature Reserve and two proposed nature reserves, Khe Ve and Giang Man, with the rest of its national distribution outside of the protected area network (Rawson <em>et al.</em> 2011). Protected areas in Lao PDR where the species occurs include Nam Kading, Nakai Nam Theun, Hin Nam No and Phou Hin Poun NPAs, though given the uncertainty of the southerly extent of the species distribution range it may occur in additional areas.<br/><br/>There is currently no dedicated protection or monitoring of <em>N. siki </em>in any site in Viet Nam, where uncontrolled hunting and habitat loss remain the greatest threats to <em>N. siki</em> (Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011). The species is in decline throughout its range in Viet Nam and there are no clear instances of conservation success to control declines, either directly or as part of other biodiversity initiatives. Key sites for conservation in Viet Nam are two large forest complexes, the Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park-Truong Son State Forest Enterprise and Khe Giua State Forest Enterprise-Bac Huong Hoa Nature Reserve complexes. The most critical conservation interventions in Viet Nam are to curtail hunting of gibbons in the key sites of Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park and Bac Huong Hoa Nature Reserve through dedicated and accountable ranger patrols (Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011). Outside of the protected area network, within state forest enterprises which support <em>N. siki</em>, sustainable logging practices and the inclusion of biodiversity conservation in site logging plans is required (Rawson<em> et al</em>. 2011). Additional survey efforts in Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park, Bac Huong Hoa Nature Reserve, Giang Man Proposed Nature Reserve and Khe Giua State Forest Enterprise may reveal these populations as higher global priorities than currently recognized (Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>In Lao PDR, support for protected area management and protection of <em>N. siki</em> is ongoing in a number of protected areas including; Nam Kading NPA, supported by Wildlife Conservation Society; Nakai – Nam Theun NPA supported by Project Anoulak in collaboration with the Watershed Management and Protection Authority (WMPA); Phou Hin Poun NPA supported by IUCN; and Hin Nam No NPA supported by GIZ-Lao Program. These sites represent the highest priority populations for conservation (Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011). Hunting is the main threat to <em>N. siki</em> in Lao PDR and therefore strict enforcement of gun control laws in key areas must remain a priority action for conservation groups. Additional efforts to control forest encroachment are also required to stop declines of <em>N. siki </em>populations. Eco-tourism opportunities in Lao PDR and building capacity of Lao conservationists represent investments which may have increasing impact in coming years (Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011). Additional, research and field surveys throughout their global range, specifically tape recordings, genetic analysis and photographic recordings will likely help better define the distribution area of the taxon relative to <em>N. annamensis</em> and <em>N. leucogenys </em>(this is an on-going project implemented and coordinated by Project Anoulak <a href=""http://conservationlaos.com/"">http://conservationlaos.com</a><em>)</em><em>.</em> Knowledge of the species' ecology is also lacking, suggesting additional ecological research is required.</p><p>  <strong></strong><em></em><u></u><sub></sub><sup></sup><br/></p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

The last population in China apparently disappeared several years prior to this species' last assessment. In Lao PDR and Viet Nam, hunting and live capture continue and will likely do so over the long-term. Over a 45 year period that includes the previous generation (2005-2019) and the next two generations (2020-2049), it is suspected that suitable habitat within the species' overall range will be reduced by 60% or more which, combined with population declines due to uncontrolled exploitation, will result in an overall population decline of 80% or more.</p>","<p>This diurnal, arboreal and territorial species is found in tall primary and degraded evergreen and semi-evergreen forest. In northwestern Viet Nam and northern Lao PDR, the animals live in a subtropical climate with a short and not very cold winter without frost (Tien 1983). In Viet Nam, the species is found from 200 m to well over 1,000 m asl, with the highest record coming from Pu Mat NP from a listening post positioned at 1,500m asl (Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011), however, individuals are now found mostly above 700 m due to lowland deforestation (Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011). In Lao PDR, gibbons are found from the Mekong plains up to at least 1,650 m in Nam Et-Phou Loei NPA (Duckworth&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1995, Duckworth 2008).<br/><br/>Gibbons are strictly arboreal and mainly frugivorous (Ruppell 2013), but there is very little field data on the behavioral ecology of <em>N. leucogenys</em>. Dao Van Tien (1983) studied the stomach contents of six wild-shot crested gibbons (genus <em>Nomascus</em>) from Viet Nam, including three <em>N. leucogenys</em>, and found 90-100% fruits, associated with some leaves and insects. This data cannot be directly compared to field observations, which usually measure the time spent eating various food items (Geissmann <em>et al</em>. 2000). Food composition of individuals from Xishuangbanna (southern Yunnan) included fruits (39%), leaves (36%), and flowers (5%) (Hu <em>et al. </em>1989). A 12-month behavioral ecology study of the species in Nam Kading NPA shows that the species here consumed more leaves (53-85% of monthly diet) than fruits, but the percentage of fruit in the diet increased from January to May when fruits were more abundant (Ruppell 2013). On average, the three groups studied annually spent 30% of their time resting, 33% feeding, 35% travelling and 2% singing (with a seasonal variation; Ruppell 2013). During the rainy season (May-October), when many fruits are available, gibbons travel less, whereas in the dry season (November-April), gibbons eat more leaves and travel for longer distances (Hu <em>et al</em>. 1989). <br/><br/>Average group size in Yunnan province, China, was 3.78 (range 3-5, n = 9) (Hu <em>et al</em>. 1989). In anecdotal reports, group sizes of three gibbon groups from Thanh Hoa and Nghe An provinces (southern part of north Viet Nam) were specified as 3, 3, and 4 individuals, respectively (Ha <em>et al</em>. 2005). Mean home range size of the three groups in Nam Kading NPA was 38 ha (29 - 44 ha), and the mean daily path length was 1.5 km (Ruppell 2013).</p>","<p><em>Nomascus leucogenys</em> has suffered from deforestation through agricultural encroachment into lowland and mountainous areas, in addition to fuel-wood and timber extraction from remaining forest habitats. Hunting for food and traditional medicines, as well as the live capture of young animals for the illegal pet trade, are major threats across the species' range and are regarded as a significant cause for its decline in all three countries, including its extirpation&#160; in China (Duckworth 2008; Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1995; Fan <em>et al</em>. 2014; Fan and Huo 2009; Li <em>et al</em>. 2018; Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011). In Viet Nam, where survey efforts have been considerable, many populations have been found to be small and local extirpations are reported as common (Rawson <em>et al.</em> 2011). Small remaining populations are vulnerable to ongoing hunting pressure and habitat degradation as well as impacts of small population sizes (e.g., disease, environmental events, inbreeding depression). Even low off-take from hunting in small populations of <em>N. leucogenys</em> can result in population collapse (Fan <em>et al</em>. 2014; Fan and Huo 2009).</p><p>Viet Nam has lost close to 15% of its forest cover since this species was last assessed in 2008 and could lose 60% or more of its forest cover the course of the next 30 years (two generations) if current annual rates do not decline. Lao PDR, the stronghold for this species, has lost more than 10% of its forest cover since this species was last assessed in 2008 and could also lose as mush as 60% or more of its forest over the course of the next 30 years (two generations).<br/></p>","<p>In China the species may now be extinct (Fan <em>et al</em>. 2014). A series of surveys has documented its decline from possibly 1,000 individuals in the 1960s to probable extirpation (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1995; Fooden 1996; Fan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014;&#160;Rawson <em>et al.</em> 2011). The most recent surveys in Mengla and Shangyong Nature Reserve, Yunnan, China, in 2008 and 2011 determined that the species is either extinct or functionally extinct in China (Fan <em>et al</em>. 2014; Fan and Huo 2009; Li <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Lao PDR holds the largest remaining populations of <em>N. leucogenys</em> due to relatively large areas of habitat, although gibbon hunting for the pet trade, bones for medicinal purposes and local consumption continues to seriously impact these populations (Duckworth 2008). Forest fragmentation is much higher in the range of <em>N. leucogenys</em> than in the ranges of other gibbon species, and the population densities are lower due to higher exploitation (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1995; Evans <em>et al.</em> 2000). In some parts of Lao PDR, the species has been protected through hunting taboos, but these local traditions have been disappearing, leading to an increase in their hunting (Duckworth 2008). Population estimates for the Lao PDR protected area network are largely lacking, and it is unlikely that there are any 'safe' populations given hunting pressure. Population estimates in Nam Et-Phou Loei NPA include 41 and 11 groups detected across a total of 368 km<sup>2</sup> with a density of 0.13 and 0.20 groups/km<sup>2 </sup>in the two areas (Coudrat and Nanthavong 2014; Ruppell 2013). At least 10 groups were detected during a short survey in the southern part of Phou Den Din NPA. Key protected areas for the species in Lao PDR include; Nam Et-Phou Loei NPA, Nam Kading NPA north of the Nam Kading River, with second tier priorities being Phou Den Din NPA, Nam Xan NPA and Phou Khao Khouay NPA.<br/><br/>In Viet Nam, the species has been severely impacted by hunting and habitat loss, and now appears to persist only in pockets, largely within the protected area network. These populations, isolated by habitat fragmentation, are further internally fragmented by hunting pressure, leaving large gaps between small numbers of groups. Rawson <em>et al.</em> (2011) estimated that there may be only 300 groups remaining in Viet Nam, most of which occur close to the Lao border. It appears that the species has been recently extirpated from Hang Kia-Pa Co, Ngoc Son-Ngo Luong and Pu Luong Nature Reserves, and Khe Net Proposed Nature Reserve (Rawson <em>et al.</em> 2011). Protected areas where the species has been confirmed since 2000 include: Muong Nhe NR, Sop Cop NR, Pu Hu NR, Xuan Lien NR, Pu Hoat NR, Pu Huong NR, Pu Mat NP, Vu Quang NP, Ke Go NR (Rawson <em>et al.</em> 2011), although populations in many of these are very low and potentially not viable in the long-term. The two priority populations for conservation in Viet Nam are Pu Mat NP with an estimated 455 gibbons in 130 groups (22 confirmed) (Rawson <em>et al.</em> 2011) and Xuan Lien NR and adjacent Pu Hoat NR, with an estimate of at least 41 groups (Rawson <em>et al.</em> 2011).</p>",Decreasing,"<p>This species occurs in northwestern Viet Nam, northern Lao PDR and southwestern China. In Viet Nam, it occurs west and south of the Black River; it has been extirpated from several areas from which it was previously recorded and is now only known from a few localities in the north-west and north-central parts of the country (Geissmann <em>et al.</em> 2000; Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011). The southern boundary of the species in Viet Nam is not well defined, however, based on genetic and vocal evidence it appears to be to at least to the Rao Nay River, near Vu Quang National Park (Thinh <em>et al.</em> 2010a, 2010b)<em>.<br/></em><br/>In Lao PDR, it occurs in the northern parts, east of the Mekong River, except for a small area in northwestern Lao PDR on the east bank of the Mekong at about 20°17'-20°25'N, where it is replaced by <em>Nomascus</em><em>&#160;concolor </em>(Geissmann<em> et al.</em> 2000). Its southern-most range limit in Lao PDR is not well defined, but it is believed to lie somewhere within Bolikhamxay-Khammouan Provinces. The Kading River is suggested as the biogeographical barrier between <em>N. leucogenys</em> and the more southerly <em>N. siki</em>, though the river towards the east is unlikely to represent a barrier given its reduced size (Thinh <em>et al</em>. 2010a, 2010b).<br/><br/>In China, the species was historically widely distributed between the Mekong and Red Rivers in Mengla, Jiangcheng and Luchun counties, in south Yunnan (Ma and Wang 1986, Fan <em>et al.</em> 2014). However, a series of surveys has documented its decline from possibly 1,000 individuals in the 1960s to probable extirpation in China (Ma and Wang 1986, Fooden 1996, Nettlebeck&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1999, Fan and Huo 2009). The most recent surveys suggested that the species is either extinct or functionally extinct in China (Fan <em>et al</em>. 2014).</p>","Hunting for food, traditional ""medicines"" and pets is a major threat across the species range, and is likely to have been the primary cause for the decline of the species in all three countries, including the presumed extinction of this species in China (Duckworth 2008; Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1995; Fan <em>et al</em>. 2014; Fan and Huo 2009; Li <em>et al.</em> 2018; Rawson <em>et al.</em> 2011).",Terrestrial,"This species is listed in CITES Appendix I.

However, maintenance of habitat quality within protected areas in its former range should be pursued to allow for the possibility of population reintroductions in the future.<br/><br/>In Viet Nam, the species is now largely restricted to the protected area network, including Muong Nhe NR, Sop Cop NR, Pu Hu NR, Xuan Lien NR, Pu Hoat NR, Pu Huong NR, Pu Mat NP, Vu Quang NP and Ke Go NR. Priority sites for conservation interventions are Pu Mat NP and Xuan Lien NR and surrounds (Rawson <em>et al</em>. 2011). Currently, no significant conservation interventions above and beyond those provided by protected areas operations are underway. Given the potential importance of these sites not just nationally, but globally, additional financial and technical investment is required, primarily to ensure effective protection as a first measure.<br/><br/>In Lao PDR, the species is present in Nam Et-Phou Loey, Nam Xam, Phou Khao Khoay, Phou Panang, Nam Kading, and Phou Den Din National Protected Areas, and also in Santong Training and Model Forest and in the Nam Ngiep Subcatchment. There is an action plan for gibbon conservation in Lao PDR which includes <em>N. leucogenys</em> (MAF 2011). The action plan identifies Nam Et-Phou Loei NPA and Nam Kading NPA as first tier priorities with Phou Den Din, Nam Xan NPA and Phou Khao Khouay NPA as second tier priorities. Currently, WCS is implementing projects in both Nam Et-Phou Loei and Nam Kading NPAs with strong enforcement components.<br/><br/>Across the species' range, hunting control is a vital conservation measure: populations are already small and fragmented and, therefore, extremely vulnerable to additional off-take. Additional measures include ensuring habitat protection and improved zoning and planning to take into account key areas for gibbons within existing protected areas. Environmental education for local communities and government authorities is required. Significant technical and financial investment will be required to ensure priority areas are controlled and maintained. While this is currently occurring in Lao PDR, in Viet Nam considerable additional (international) inputs are likely to be required.<br/></span><br/>The species is commonly represented in zoo collections, both regionally and internationally, and as such there is future opportunity for reintroduction and/or population reinforcement, assuming required protocols can be met (Campbell <em>et al</em>. 2015).",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

Quantitative analysis has also suggested that the population may face a  high risk of extinction under some ecologically feasible future  scenarios (Turvey <em>et al</em>. 2015). In the late 1950s, the population was estimated to be over 2,000 individuals (Haimoff 1984, Liu <em>et al</em>. 1987). By 1989, the Hainan Gibbon population was thought to have been reduced to a single relict population of 21 gibbons occurring in four groups, restricted to a 16 km<sup>2</sup> patch of primary montane rainforest on Mt. Futouling within Bawangling National Nature Reserve (Liu <em>et al</em>. 1989). The Hainan Gibbon is also threatened by issues associated with extremely small population size, such as inbreeding effects, poor mate availability, and anthropogenic or natural disaster, with population modelling indicating that the surviving population is highly vulnerable to such issues (Chan <em>et al</em>. 2005, Fellowes <em>et al</em>. 2008, Bryant&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015, 2016).</p>","<p>This species currently occurs in montane rainforest, at altitudes ranging from 650 to 1,200 m (Chan <em>et al</em>. 2005), although specimens were collected at lower elevations prior to the complete clearance of lowland forest on Hainan. It is diurnal, arboreal, and mostly frugivorous; the most difficult time for the gibbons to find food in Bawangling National Nature Reserve is between February and April, when only a handful of food-plant species are available for the gibbons.<br/><br/>Group size has been reported to range from 4-8 individuals, with an average of 5.3-5.5 individuals, depending on the year of the study; during 2009-2011 the largest group comprised of 11 individuals (Mootnick <em>et al</em>. 2012). Like its closest congener the Cao Vit Gibbon (<em>Nomascus nasutus</em>), the Hainan Gibbon appears to be habitually polygynous with a bi-female breeding system (Bryant <em>et al</em>. 2016). Home range size was previously thought to be large for gibbons, with estimates between 2.0-9.87 km<sup>2</sup> (Liu <em>et al</em>. 1989, Wei <em>et al</em>. 2004, Zhou <em>et al</em>. 2008). However, recent standardised analysis has indicated that home range size is actually in line with closely related species, with an average home range of 1.49 km<sup>2</sup> (Bryant 2014, Bryant <em>et al</em>. 2016b, Turvey <em>et al</em>. 2017). The third group has a smaller home range of less than 1 km<sup>2</sup> (Bryant 2014, Bryant <em>et al</em>. 2016, Turvey <em>et al</em>. 2017).</p>","<p>  </p><p>Only 1-2 probable reports of gibbon hunting are documented from the last three decades at Bawangling National Nature Reserve (Turvey <em>et al</em>. 2017), due to local taboos and high penalties. However, although core remaining habitat at Bawangling has been relatively well protected, poaching of other wildlife with rifles and traps continues to occur within the reserve, so this species is still potentially at threat from hunting activity (e.g. accidental shooting through mistaken identity).<br/><br/>The Hainan Gibbon is also threatened by issues associated with extremely small population size, such as inbreeding effects, poor mate availability, and anthropogenic or natural disaster, with population modelling indicating that the surviving population is highly vulnerable to such issues (Chan&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005, Fellowes&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008, Bryant <em>et al</em>. 2015, 2016). There are reports of a sex bias in births, but it is not possible to identify the sex of young Hainan gibbons in the field, because immature individuals do not differ in fur colouration or calls, and sexual organs of males and females resemble each other (T. Geissmann pers. comm. 2006). However, recent genetic analysis has indicated that three out of four offspring born into one group in recent years were male (Bryant <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>Forest loss also remains a threat: between 1991 and 2008, remote sensing vegetation maps reported a decrease in gibbon habitat across Hainan by 540 km<sup>2</sup> (35%), and by 6.3 km<sup>2</sup> (7%) in the locality of the last remaining population at Bawangling National Nature Reserve. Forest patches suitable to support gibbons decreased from 754 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;to 316 km<sup>2</sup> in total area during this period, with plantations replacing forests below 760 m, and habitat becoming increasingly degraded (Liu <em>et al</em>. 1987, 1989; Turvey <em>et al</em>. 2017).</p><p>  </p>","<p>  </p><p>In the late 1950s, the population was estimated to be over 2,000 individuals (Haimoff 1984, Liu <em>et al</em>. 1987).

Futouling within Bawangling National Nature Reserve (Liu <em>et al</em>. 1989), although other studies have since suggested that now-extirpated remnant gibbon populations may have persisted beyond this date in other protected areas across Hainan (Zhou <em>et al</em>. 2008a,b). In 1998, the Bawangling population was thought to consist of 17 individuals (Wei <em>et al</em>. 2004). During a comprehensive survey in 2003, only 13 individuals were recorded, consisting of two groups, in addition to two solitary males (Chan <em>et al</em>. 2005). Fellowes <em>et al</em>. (2008) reported 17-20 individuals in two social groups and with up to five solitary individuals, based upon fieldwork in 2007. A new, third group comprising two breeding females was formed in 2011 (Bryant 2014), and in 2015 a fourth group with a single breeding female was established (Bryant <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>At present there are more than 25 individuals, but the exact number cannot be ascertained due to the difficulty in tracking dispersed sub-adults, especially the non-vocal females, although recent research indicates that new acoustic monitoring techniques may help to clarify the total number of solitary gibbons (Bryant <em>et al</em>. 2015, 2016). All mated females in the three previously known groups have produced infants roughly every two years, and all infants grew to adulthood except the death of the third group’s first neonates (B. Chan, unpubl. data). Unfortunately, little is known of the natural mortality rates of any age class in the population (Bryant 2014, Turvey <em>et al</em>. 2017). Furthermore, due to the inconsistent population estimation techniques employed and variation in survey effort over time, it is difficult to draw any firm conclusions regarding any obvious population trends from the variation between past estimates (Turvey <em>et al</em>. 2014).</p><p>  </p>",Stable,"<p>  </p><p>Listed as Critically Endangered because of an observed decline of at least 80% over the past 45 years (three generations) due primarily to hunting and habitat loss (Mootnick <em>et al.</em> 2012; Turvey <em>et al.</em> 2015); because its extent of occurrence is less than 100 km² (Bryant <em>et al.</em> 2016), all individuals are in a single subpopulation (Bryant&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015), and there has been a continuing decline in the area, extent and quality of habitat; because its population size is less than 50 mature individuals (Bryant <em>et al.</em> 2015; Zhou&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008); and because quantitative analysis has suggested that the population may face a high risk of extinction under some ecologically feasible future scenarios (Turvey <em>et al</em>. 2015).

At present it is only known to occur within Bawangling National Nature Reserve on Hainan (Chan<em> et al.</em> 2005, Geissmann <em>et al.</em> 2000, Turvey <em>et al.</em> 2015) and is the most threatened primate species in the world (Geissmann 2005). Suitable gibbon habitat exists more widely across the Bawangling landscape and also outside Bawangling, and there have been anecdotal reports of gibbon occurrence in various forested sites, such as Yinggeling National Nature Reserve, Jiaxi Nature Reserve and Limushan Nature Reserve (B. Chan unpubl. data, Turvey<em> et al</em>. 2016). Surveys have been conducted in some of these areas, but have not as yet detected any concrete evidence of any additional surviving gibbon individuals or populations (Turvey <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>Within Bawangling, past conservation efforts have focused on regular monitoring of the gibbon population, restoration of degraded lowland forest, and engagement of local villagers in conservation activities (Fellowes <em>et al.</em> 2008). Community work including public outreach and promotion of alternative livelihoods to lessen the villager's reliance on forest products and lands have also been initiated, however, there is a need for continued gun and trap confiscation around Bawangling. Following the 2014 conservation action planning meeting for the Hainan Gibbon (Turvey <em>et al</em>. 2015), current key conservation activities include: continued monitoring and development of optimal monitoring techniques to better understand gibbon dispersal, group formation and colonisation of new habitat; continued effective protection of gibbon habitat and enhancement of forest connectivity within and beyond the reserve, to promote expansion of gibbons into additional good-quality habitat; development of an emergency response plan in the event of a crisis situation; and improved communication to facilitate collaboration among stakeholders. Protection and restoration of adjoining lowland habitat is also necessary to allow longer-term expansion of the gibbon population, and enrichment planting of late successional gibbon food plant species in the species-poor secondary forest adjacent to current gibbon habitat is likely to constitute an important conservation action.<br/><br/>Captive breeding does not appear to be an appropriate strategy for this species in the short-term, because the population appears to be breeding at a healthy rate in the wild, and there are no individuals currently in captivity, with the cost of removing individuals from the current population (and potentially losing any individuals during capture) predicted to have adverse effects on <em>in situ</em> population survival (Bryant 2014, Bryant<em> et al.</em> in prep).</p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

The species is also predicted to decline by more than 50% over the next three generations across its entire range due to continuing hunting pressures and loss of habitat. Hunted animals are used for traditional medicines, and for national and international trade in pets and tourist photo props. Bengal Slow Lorises are also caught for meat, and their body parts are used as tourist key rings. The combined effects of forest loss of more than 30% over the last 24 years, and disappearance of the species in several locations in countries like Cambodia due to hunting, and continued threats into the future are factors determining the declines in the past, continuing and suspected declines in the future.</p>","<p><span class=""apple-converted-space"">This is an arboreal, nocturnal species that inhabits tropical evergreen rainforest, semi-evergreen forest, and mixed deciduous forest. In Viet Nam it is found only in secondary forests, and on the edge of primary forests; the species also occurs in agricultural fields and plantations (V. Thanh pers. comm., Pliosongnoen <em>et al</em>. 2010, Kumar <em>et al</em>. 2014). It ranges from sea level (U. Streicher pers. comm.) up to 2,400 m (Choudhury 2001). In Cambodia, <em>N. bengalensis </em>has been observed in dipterocarp and evergreen forest (Mould 2013, Eam Sam Un 2014) and community forests (Eam Sam Un 2014). In India, they are found in semi-evergreen, evergreen and mixed deciduous forest (Das 2005, 2009, 2014; Pliosungnoen 2014). In Laos, the species is found often in protected evergreen forests (Evans 2000, Coudrat 2012), and have also been observed in plantation forests (Pliosungnoen unpublished data) and bamboo stands (Streicher pers. comm). It can live in heavily disturbed agricultural areas if suitable foods are available.<span class=""apple-converted-space""><br/><br/>The diet of the Bengal Slow Loris consists of nectar, plant bark, fruits and small invertebrates; the majority of their wild diet comprises plant exudates and this is a key staple year round (Swapna <em>et al</em>. 2009, Pliosungnoen <em>et al</em>. 2010, Das <em>et al</em>. 2014). <em>Nycticebus bengalensis</em> are venomous, as are other members of the slow loris genus (Nekaris <em>et al</em>. 2013).</span><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><br/><br/>This animal's life span is about 15 years, and generation time is 7-8 years. Females give birth to one offspring per litter once every two years in semi-wild conditions (Rowe 1996). In captivity, this rate may be slightly higher (U. Streicher pers. comm).</span></p>","<span class=""apple-converted-space"">The major threats that this species' habitat faces include farming, timber removal, human settlement, road building, dams, power lines, fragmentations, soil loss and erosion, and deliberately set fires. It is hunted and traded for food, traditional ""medicine"", sport, and as pet (Molur&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2003, Nekaris and Nijman 2007, V. Thanh and U. Streicher pers. comm., Kumar <em>et al</em>. 2014). Road kills represent another threat to this species (Rhadakrishna <em>et al</em>. 2006). It is also threatened for the tourist photo prop trade across some of its range, particularly in Thailand, where 94% of individuals photographed in the photo prop trade from Patong beach were <em>N. bengalensis </em>(Osterberg and Nekaris 2015); this trade is extending into Europe, in countries such as Turkey. The species has been observed for sale in markets for traditional medicine purposes at Mong La, on the Chinese border of Myanmar (Nijman <em>et al</em>. 2013), where its arms are also sold as key rings (Nijman <em>et al</em>. 2015) and is also known to be sold for use in traditional medicine elsewhere (Cambodia, Viet Nam and India) (Starr <em>et al</em>. 2010). The exploitation of the species appears to be particularly high in Cambodia with researchers reporting no <em>N. bengalensis </em>present at most sites (Starr <em>et al</em>. 2010). The release of slow lorises confiscated from the illegal pet trade with little or no rehabilitation is a threat to all slow loris species, as is translocation from human-dominated landscapes into forests, to which individuals of the species may not be adapted (Kumar <em>et al.</em> 2014, Starr and Nekaris 2015). Lack of law enforcement further threatens slow loris species across their range (Starr <em>et al</em>. 2010, Nijman <em>et al</em>. 2014).","<p>In India, the encounter rates vary from 0.1 to 0.77/km (Radhakrishna&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006). Surveys have been carried out in Assam, India since 2005, with densities fluctuating over time. In 2005, densities of <em>N. bengalensis </em>ranged from 0.03-0.05 individuals/km (Das, 2005), in 2009 densities were found at 0.18 individuals/km (Das <em>et al</em>. 2009). In 2014, densities of <em>N. bengalensis </em>had declined to a range of 0.06-0.20 individuals/km (Das <em>et al</em>. 2015).

In 2011, a juvenile Bengal slow loris was encountered downhill from Saw Law (N 26.15396, E 98. 27053; elevation 1,541 m asl) on the way back to Chibwe (N 25.88614, E 98.12851; elevation 257 m asl). Hunters in this area also reported seeing them during shifting cultivation. A captive Bengal slow loris was recorded in Phimaw Internally Displaced Person’s camp in February - March 2013 that was reported to come from the local area. According to local people, slow lorises are rarely seen in this area and are not easy to find. <br/><br/>In Bangladesh, no specific nation-wide population survey on this species has been carried out, but a 2015 survey team encountered 34 Bengal slow lorises (18-night survey) in Satchari National Park of Sylhet division. A one-night survey in Lawachara National Park revealed three individuals (S.C. Rahman, pers. comm). The species was also recorded in Rema-Kalenga&#160;Wildlife Sanctuary (Feeroz <em>et al</em>, 2011) and Rajkandi Reserve Forest of Sylhet area (M. Foysal, T. Khan, pers.comm). Feeroz (2013) reported <em>N. bengalensis </em>as being rare in Teknaf Wildlife Sanctuary of Chittagong region. All of these forests are semi- evergreen. A photography record is available from Kaptai National Park, Rangamati Hill District under Chittagong division (S.R. Rahul, pers. comm.). Beside these records, since 2010, several Bengal Slow Lorises were taken from human habitation in Jamalpur, Sherpur and Mymensingh district. These districts have some deciduous forests and are connected with Meghalaya state of India.<br/><br/>In Bhutan Choudhury (2008) reports that Bengal slow loris habitat is mostly tropical evergreen and semi-evergreen forests in the foothills up to 300 m. The species has been indirectly recorded in the possession of woodcutters in four dzongkhags including Pema Gatshel, Samdrup Jongkar, Sarpang and Zemgang. From this, Choudhury inferred that they should occur in Royal Manas National Park, Khaling Wildlife Sanctuary and Phibsoo Wildlife Sanctuary. Wangchuk&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2004) wrote that lorises also occur in Chukha and Samchi districts, but did not say on what evidence. The existing records indicate that the Sankosh River is the western limit for the species in Bhutan as well as Assam.<br/><br/>In Lao PDR, some researchers report the population to occur potentially in large forest tracts (R. Timmins pers. comm). Duckworth (1994) and Ratajszczak (1998), however, both reported the species as being very rare in Lao PDR, with the former reporting abundance indices of about 0.30-0.65/km at sites including: Central Laos (Phou Xang He, NakaiNam Theun, Xe Piang, Muang Hom, Nam Kading, Nam Ao, Bang Navang) and South Laos (Xe Namoy). In 2000, published data from 1994-1995 recorded <em>N. bengalensis </em>frequency as “common” in some forests (Phou Khaokhoay NBCA, Nam Kading NBCA, and Bolavens Northeast PPA), whereas they were encountered “occasional” in others (Nakai Plateau) (Evans, et al., 2000, Streicher, 2014). A single record comes from Southern Laos in Xe Kaman lowlands in Dong Ampham NBCA, Attapu Province&#160; (Davidson <em>et al</em>. 1997).<br/><br/>In Viet Nam, the populations are severely reduced and have disappeared from many forests (Fitch-Snyder and Thanh 2002; V. Thanh pers. comm). Surveys carried out in northern Viet Nam at Na Hang Nature Reserve in 2013 recorded a density of 0.09 individuals/km (Blair, unpublished data). Recent surveys of N. bengalensis in Central Vietnam at Bach Ma National Park returned no animals in 30.4 km of surveys (Blair, unpublished data). A large population with a phenotype of the Cambodian forms occurs on Phu Quoc island in the Gulf of Thailand (Huaong and Blair, pers. comm). Surveys in 2014 in Phu Quoc Island recorded a density of 0.38 individuals/km (Blair, unpublished data).<br/><br/>In Cambodia the species is very rare and has only been seen west of the Mekong River in Samkos Wildlife Sanctuary and Phnom Kulen National Park at 22.5-25.0 animals per km2 (Starr et al., 2010). Observations of recently hunted animals were made in Preah Vihear Protection Forest, Kulen Promtep Wildlife Sanctuary and Phnom Tbeng (Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2011). Starr <em>et al</em>. (2010) failed to detect this species in Bokor National Park and Cardamoms Protected Forest; they also did not detect it east of the Mekong (Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary and Mondulkiri PF); Coudrat et al. also could not find this species east of the Mekong at the following sites: Mondulkiri (Lumphat Wildlife Sanctuary, Phnom Pritch Wildlife Sanctuary) or Ratanakiri (Vonsei District, Virachey National Park, Seima Protection Forest, Snoul Wildlife Sanctuary). Other surveyors in Cambodia have noted the presence of the species in a number of community forests (Eam Sam Un, pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>In Thailand, Bengal slow loris is thought to be widespread (W. Brockelman pers. comm.) but has never been surveyed specifically.&#160; It is known from Khao Yai National Park. Pliosungnoen <em>et al</em>. (2010) found that the species is absent from many forests, and occurs at very low densities when present. In plantation forest in Khao Ang Runai Wildlife Sanctuary, they recorded Bengal slow lories at a density of 0.64 individuals/km (Pliosungnoen <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>In China, surveys have been carried out since 2013. Bengal Slow Loris habitat is mostly primary evergreen broad-leaf forest up to 2,200 m. The population occurs in counties of western and southwestern Yunnan (Yingjiang, Longchuan, Ruili, Tengchong, Mangshi, Zhenkang, Cangyuan, Gengma, Yongde, Shuangjiang, Ximeng, Lancang, Menglian, Menghai, Mengla), even in secondary forests and agricultural plantations (Ni, pers. comm.). Survey in Cangyuan recorded a density of 0.33 individuals/km (Ni, unpublished data). In southern and southeastern Yunnan, Bengal slow loris is mostly distributed in scattered nature reserves as follows: Yuanjiang, Amushan, Guanyinshan, Huanglianshan, Fenshuiling, Daweishan, Laojunshan, Gulinqing, Laoshan. The populations are severely reduced and have possibly disappeared from southwest of Guangxi Province (Ni, per. comm.). Suitable habitat, also containing gibbons, can be found in many nature reserves, where the species is likely present but still to be confirmed, including Nanguanhe, Ailaoshan, Xishuangbanna, Nabanhe, Wenshan in Yuannan; and Bangliang in Guangxi.<br/></p>",Decreasing,"<p>This species occurs in Bangladesh, Cambodia West of the Mekong River, China (southern and western Yunnan and possibly in southwestern Guangxi), north-eastern India (Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, and Tripura), Lao PDR, Myanmar (including the Mergui Archipelago), Thailand north of the Isthmus of Kra, and Viet Nam.</p>","The species is&#160;<span class=""apple-converted-space"">hunted and traded for (i) food, traditional ""medicine"", sport, and as pets (Molur&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2003, Nekaris and Nijman 2007, V.

Following the protocols set forth by the IUCN Reintroduction Specialists Group is vital to assess the impact of these reintroductions.

It is suspected that the population will continue to decline by at least 50% over the next 24 years. Population reduction is due primarily to hunting for pet trade, food, and ‘medicinal’ purposes in much of its distribution range, resulting in drastic declines which are reflected in high prices in the market and reduced numbers sold.

They are believed to treat more than 100 diseases, including to regain strength after childbirth, stomach problems, healing wounds and broken bones, and in the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases. Their market value has more than doubled in the last 15 years, pointing towards reduced numbers in the wild (Starr, <em>et al</em>., 2010).

The three principal threats across Sumatra are small population effects (e.g., the Allee effect), human disturbance, and poaching. Threats in the three populations are slightly different (Miller&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). In Way Kambas National Park, threats are poaching, bird collection, illegal fishing, agar wood collection, human disturbance, annual and catastrophic drought, annual and catastrophic forest fires. In Bukit Barisan Selatan, primary threats are poaching, the Allee effect and resultant inbreeding, human disturbance (e.g., natural resource collection activities such as non-timber forest products, illegal bird collection, pangolin poaching, and illegal fishing), road development, small and large scale encroachment, and catastrophic events. In Aceh Province, threats include poaching, the Allee effect and resultant inbreeding, catastrophic events, El Nino Southern Oscillation events, human disturbance and encroachment, forest conversion into various commodities and plantations, and road development. In Gunung Leuser National Park, the primary threats are poaching, the potential for stochastic catastrophes, human encroachment and disturbance, forest conversion, and road construction.","The species inhabits tropical rainforest and montane moss forest, and occasionally occurs at forest margins and in secondary forest (Nowak 1999). Sumatran Rhinos occur mainly in hilly areas nearby water sources, and exhibits seasonal movements, moving uphill in times of lowland flooding (van Strien 1975). This shy species is dependent on salt licks, and occurs mostly in primary forest in protected areas, but wandering into secondary forests outside protected areas, especially in the dry season in search of water (van Strien 1975).<br/><br/>Males are primarily solitary, but can have overlapping territories with females, which are commonly found with offspring (Nowak 1999). The home range size of females is probably no more than 500 ha, while males wonder over larger areas, with likely limited dispersal distance. The species is generally solitary, except for mating pairs and mothers with young (Nowak 1999). Its life history characteristics are not well known, with longevity estimated at about 35–40 years, gestation length of approximately 15-16 months. Captive females have copulated as early as six years of age, and males at eight years of age (Miller <em>et al</em>. 2015; IRF website 2018, www.rhinos.org). Females may develop reproductive pathologies if they do not become pregnant (Roth pers. comm). Because they are induced ovulators (Roth <em>et al</em>. 2001) timing of females meeting males is critical; females are most likely to become pregnant when an ovarian follicle is approximately 20 mm in size prior to copulation.<br/><br/>Home ranges are up to 5,000 ha for males, 1,000–1,500 ha for females. Daily movements between feeding sites and wallows are probably only a few kilometres per day. Longer treks are made when males and females go to saltlicks (5-10 km) and by males exploring their large ranges. Dispersal appears to be mainly by sub-adult animals (4-7 years) old. In this period they may be found rather far from the home grounds. Adults are very traditional in the use of their ranges and will not move away unless severely disturbed. Water is never very far away in the habitats occupied by the Sumatran rhino.","The three principal threats across Sumatra are small population effects (e.g., the Allee effect), human disturbance, and poaching.&#160;The species is now so reduced that there are very small numbers in each locality where it still survives. Threats in the three populations are slightly different (Miller <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). In Way Kambas National Park, threats are poaching, disturbance from bird collection, illegal fishing, agar wood collection, human disturbance, annual and catastrophic drought, annual and catastrophic forest fires.

In Aceh Province, threats include poaching, the Allee effect and resultant inbreeding, catastrophic events, El Nino Southern Oscillation events, human disturbance and encroachment, forest conversion into various commodities and plantations, and road development. In Gunung Leuser National Park, the primary threats are poaching, the potential for stochastic catastrophes, human encroachment and disturbance, forest conversion, and road construction.<br/><br/>Poaching looms as a threat but at this time is opportunistic and that organized criminal networks are not in operation at the scale they are in Africa. Poaching is primarily driven by the demand in Viet Nam and China for the supposedly medicinal properties of rhino horns and other body parts, and as a high-value gift item. Many centuries of over-hunting as well as habitat loss has reduced this species to a tiny percentage of its former population and range.","The total population now is estimated to be fewer than 80 individuals. Until the early 1990s the numbers continued to decline at a rapid rate with estimated losses of 50% or more of the population per decade (Foose and van Strien 1997). The total population of the Sumatran Rhino has declined by at least 80 percent in the last 30 years. The combination of the extent and rate of population reduction, as well as population fragmentation, makes it perhaps the most threatened large mammal on Earth.&#160;<br/><br/>The subspecies <em>Dicerorhinus sumatrensis sumatrensis</em> now occurs only on Sumatra, where there are fewer than 80 individuals in roughly ten subpopulations (Miller <em>et al.&#160;</em>2015). The largest populations remain in Bukit Barisan Selatan, Way Kambas, and Gunung Leuser National Park (Miller<em> et al.</em> 2015). The population estimate is still in question in Bukit Barisan Selatan, with no estimate larger than 10 individuals at most and no signs of calves in the past four years. There are thought to be 15-25 rhinos in Way Kambas, the only population considered to be slowly growing, with four calves observed in 2014. In Aceh, there are five subpopulations, ranging in estimated size from two to 24, for a possible maximum total of 30-40 individuals. Miller <em>et al. </em>(2015) report that there may be three small subpopulations in Leuser Barat, but this has not been confirmed. At least four of the five subpopulations in the north of Sumatra are considered non-viable, containing only between two and five animals (Miller <em>et al.</em> 2015). Despite protection, populations continue to decrease. Anti-poaching teams are in place in Bukit Barisan Selatan and Way Kambas National Parks, and in parts of Gunung Leuser.&#160;<br/><br/>A tiny population (perhaps no more than three animals) was discovered in east Kalimantan in 2012.

However, it has only been partially implemented and in few areas. The low number apparently poses a big challenge in obtaining an adequate sample that will result in reliable population estimates. Meanwhile, there has also been a concern about introducing disturbance if an intensive survey is conducted in sensitive areas. Because of this, to-date no robust population data are available. The current survey is directed to focus on identifying rhino that are considered ""doomed"" and to be rescued as recommended by the PVA analysis (Miller <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015) and endorsed under the Government of Indonesia's Emergency Action Plan.<br/><br/>There are ongoing efforts to further develop capacity for managed breeding in Indonesia.

An <em>Arenga</em> palm removal/management effort was initiated in 2010 in the Gunung Honje portion of the park as part of the Javan Rhino Study and Conservation Area. As of December 2018, 150 ha of <em>Arenga</em> have been removed from the area.<br/><br/>Since 2014, there have been documented cases of fishermen using poison to fish in water bodies inside Ujung Kulon. The effect on the park's Javan rhinos is unknown, but this practice could have a serious effect if it goes unchecked.<br/><br/>Ujung Kulon National Park is home to up to 800 Javan banteng (<em>Bos javanicus)</em>. Banteng are primarily grazers (but they browse when grass is in short supply) and their feeding ecology partially overlaps with Javan rhinos (also browsers). If banteng numbers are very large, as is the case in Ujung Kulon, there is a negative impact on availability of foraging plants for rhinos. It is believed that food competition with banteng may have contributed to the slow historical decrease in Javan rhino numbers.<br/><br/>Disease transmitted by local domestic cattle also is a potential threat (Khairani 2009).<br/><br/>Ujung Kulon and surrounding areas were decimated by the eruption of Krakatau in 1883, one of the most violent volcanic events in modern times. Following that eruption, lowland tropical forest habitats ultimately regenerated and were recolonized by Javan rhinos, among other species. However, should a similar large-scale eruption occur in the near future, Javan rhino populations would not be safe from the catastrophe and able to repopulate the region. Anak Krakatau (“son of Krakatau”) was still active through December 2018, when it collapsed underwater, causing a tsunami. Javan rhino populations were not affected.</span></span></p>","Based on camera trap data, an estimated 68 animals (29 adult males, 24 adult females, and 15 juveniles), live in Ujung Kulon National Park on the western tip of Java (Ujung Kulon National Park 2018). It is not known how many of the adult animals are reproductive, but we infer that perhaps 33% of adults might breed. The addition of camera traps throughout the park has led to much more accurate population data. Camera trap data from studies conducted in 2013-2014, with coverage of the entire park, were verified by the IUCN/SSC Asian Rhino Specialist Group, showing that at that time, there were between 58-61 animals. The population has not grown significantly over the last two decades largely because of changes in the park’s habitat caused by the Arenga palm (<em>Arenga obtusifolia</em>), possible food competition with the Javan Banteng (<em>Bos javanicus</em>), and human encroachment. <br/><br/>Three highly decomposed Javan Rhino carcasses with horns intact were discovered in 2010 (W. Ramono pers. comm.), and five animals with intact horns were found dead from 2010 to early 2019. The population in Cat Tien National Park in Viet Nam was declared extinct in 2010 (Brook&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011).<br/><br/>There are no animals currently in captivity, and a total of only 22 individuals have ever been known to be held in captivity (Rookmaaker&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1998).",Stable,"The Javan Rhino formerly occurred from Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Lao PDR, Cambodia, Viet Nam, and probably southern China through peninsular Malaya to Sumatra and Java (Grubb 2005). The species' precise historical range is indeterminate, as early accounts failed to distinguish rhinos to specific level, due to partial sympatry with the other two Asian rhino species (<em>Rhinoceros sunicornis</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>Dicerorhinus sumatrensis</em>). Beginning in the middle of the nineteenth century, the species was extirpated from most of its historical range, and currently occurs only in one, small, isolated area. The last records of Javan Rhino vary, from 1920 in Myanmar, to 1932 in Malaysia, and 1959 on Sumatra (Indonesia) (Simon and Geroudet 1970).<br/> <br/> The subspecies&#160;<em>Rhinoceros sondaicus inermis</em>&#160;formerly occurred in northeastern India, Bangladesh, and Myanmar, but is now extinct (Nowak 1999).<br/> <br/> The subspecies&#160;<em>Rhinoceros sondaicus annamiticus</em>&#160;formerly occurred in Viet Nam, Lao PDR, Cambodia, and eastern Thailand. The last individual of this subspecies was poached in May 2010 in the Cat Loc part (Dong Nai province) of the Cat Tien National Park in Viet Nam (Brook&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011).<br/> <br/> The subspecies&#160;<em>Rhinoceros sondaicus sondaicus</em>&#160;formerly occurred from Thailand through Malaysia, to the islands of Java and Sumatra (Indonesia). The only remaining population occurs on the Ujung Kulon Peninsula (Hoogerwerf 1970), which forms the westernmost extremity of the island of Java. The Javan population of this subspecies has been restricted to this area since around the 1930s.<br/> <br/>This is a lowland species that typically occurs up to 600 m (Sectionov and Waladi pers. comm.), but has been recorded above 1,000 m (Nowak 1999).","Over-hunting for its horn and other medicinal products has driven this formerly widespread species to the brink of extinction. There currently is no confirmation that Javan rhino horn is in trade. There has been no known poaching in Ujung Kulon National Park for the past 20 years; any rhino carcasses discovered have had intact horns. The last Javan Rhino was poached in Viet Nam in 2010 and found with its horn removed; we assume that Javan rhino horn has been in trade from Vietnam and for the Ujung Kulon population, poaching for horn is a looming threat requiring constant and enhanced protection of the population.",Terrestrial,"<p>The Javan Rhino is legally protected in Indonesia and has been listed on CITES Appendix I since 1975.<br/><br/><span lang=""EN-NZ"">Javan Rhinos have been&#160;protected and&#160;<span lang=""EN-NZ"">monitored by the Ujung Kulon National Park authority, the World Wildlife Fund - Indonesia (WWF - Indonesia) and/or Yayasan Badak Indonesia (YABI or the Rhino Foundation of Indonesia) over a period spanning three decades, using foot patrols and more recently, adding video camera trap monitoring. Over 3 decades, there have been no recorded rhino poaching events (the last rhino poaching incident was reported in the early 1970s). Five Rhino Protection Units (RPUs), operated by Yayasan Badak Indonesia, currently protect the species in Ujung Kulon National Park, in addition to Park guards.</span><br/><br/>In 2007, the Government   of Indonesia published the <em>Strategy and   Action Plan for the Conservation of Rhinos in Indonesia</em> (Directorate   General of Forest Protection and Nature Conservation 2007) which outlines a series of conservation   actions for the species. <br/><br/>Following the preliminary implementation of the 2007&#160;Strategy and Action Plan, in 2008 the IUCN/SSC Asian Rhino Specialist Group (AsRSG) convened a meeting to assess progress of the conservation strategy and to set immediate goals and actions. Whereas it was formerly believed that Ujung Kulon had the holding capacity for more than 100 Javan rhino, it was suggested that the park’s carrying capacity had diminished to as low as 70 due to habitat changes and possible food competition with Javan banteng. The AsRSG and government representatives agreed that the habitat assessments for both Ujung Kulon National Park and possible second habitat relocation sites outside Ujung Kulon peninsula should be carried out by an independent agency to ensure critical information would be unbiased. Field surveys of the Ujung Kulon peninsula and proposed relocation sites on the island of Java in Gunung Honje, Gunung Halimun, Masigit Kareumbi and Leuweung Sancang were carried out (Ramono <em>et al.</em> 2009), with Gunung Honje emerging as the best Javan rhino habitat among these areas.<br/><br/>The&#160;<em style=""font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;"">Strategy   and Action Plan for the Conservation of Rhinos in Indonesia, 2007-2017</em><em>&#160;</em>recommended eradication   trials of <em style=""font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;"">Arenga</em> palm on a medium-sized scale to monitor rhino and banteng   food plant development. In June 2010, the Government of Indonesia launched the Javan Rhino Conservation and Study Area, inside the Gunung Honje area of Ujung Kulon National Park, with the aim of intensifying active management, including creating new wallows, replanting natural forest vegetation with rhino food plants in some areas, carefully implementing controlled slash and burn patch management in designated and closed forest areas to promote regeneration of rhino food plants, and continuing and increasing anti-poaching protection, including establishing new patrol paths and additional guard posts, and constructing a fence to isolate the area in Gunung Honje so that the species' basic biology could be studied and individuals assessed for suitability for translocation (International Rhino Foundation 2018). One-hundred-fifty (150) ha had been cleared of&#160;<em style=""font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;"">Arenga</em>&#160;palm as of the end of 2018 in the Javan Rhino Conservation and Study Area, which now is frequented by at least 10 rhinos.<br/><br/>In 2015, a Population and Habitat Viability&#160;Assessment was conducted (Haryono <em>et al.</em> 2016), which updates information and actions needed to conserve the species. The most important finding from the assessment was that the Ujung Kulon population absolutely cannot tolerate poaching.<br/><br/>For population monitoring, the Ujung Kulon National Park authority primarily relies on camera trap surveys at present. Faecal DNA analyses were started but have not been completed due to technical difficulties. Together, these techniques could combine to permit better understanding of population genetics and spatial distribution on which future management decisions can be based.<br/><br/>Although the Ujung Kulon population is   believed to be stable, the park may be close to carrying capacity and the population probably cannot grow significantly larger without additional intervention. The idea of establishing a second population&#160;has been under   discussion for almost a decade by the IUCN/SSC Asian Rhino Specialist Group, various NGOs,&#160;and the Government of Indonesia. No significant progress in developing a second population has been made to-date. There is an urgent need to review the feasibility of a range expansion program, since the only known viable population occurs in a geographically restricted area of Java.</p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

The species is found in 12 sites, with a total area of occupancy less than 2,000 km². Useable habitat changes periodically with monsoon flooding, especially in Kaziranga National Park, Orang National Park, and Pabitora Wildlife Sanctuary. Populations are severely fragmented, and more than 70% of the population is found in Assam's Kaziranga National Park; a catastrophic event there could have a devastating impact on the species. Habitat loss and degradation due to invasion by alien plants into grasslands, grazing, human encroachment and silting up is occurring in part of the species' range,","The species inhabits the riverine grasslands of the Terai and Brahmaputra Basins (Foose and van Strien 1997). The species prefers these alluvial plain grasslands, but was known to occur in adjacent swamps and forests. The populations are currently restricted to habitats surrounded by human-dominated landscapes, so that the species often occurs in adjacent cultivated areas, pastures, and secondary forests. The diet includes mainly grasses, but also some fruit, leaves, shrub and tree branches, and cultivated crops (Nowak 1999). Greater One-horned Rhinos also regularly utilize mineral licks. Males are solitary, with unstructured, overlapping territories. Females are solitary unless they have a calf. Calves remain with their mother for 3-4 years.<br/><br/>Its life history characteristics are not well known, with longevity estimated at 30-45 years, gestation length of approximately 16 months (as with other rhino species), and age at sexual maturity estimated at 5-7 years for females and 8-10 years for males (Nowak 1999, International Rhino Foundation website 2018).","The Greater One-horned Rhinoceros declined to near extinction in the early 1900s, primarily due to widespread conversion of alluvial plains grasslands to agricultural development, which led to human-rhino conflicts and easier accessibility for hunters. Sport hunting became common in the late 1800s and early 1900s. A reversal of government policies shortly thereafter protected many of the remaining populations. However, poaching, mainly for the use of the horn in Traditional Asian Medicine, has remained a constant threat and the success is precarious without continued support for conservation efforts in India and Nepal. Past poaching led to declines in several important populations, especially those in Chitwan, Manas, Laokhowa, and the Babai Valley area of Bardia, but in the past 5 years, poaching has decreased and the populations in these areas are increasing (except for Laokhowa Wildlife Sanctuary).<br/><br/>However, not all recent population decreases can be linked to poaching. There have been serious declines in quality of habitat in some areas. This is due to: 1) severe invasion by alien plants into grasslands affecting some populations; 2) demonstrated reductions in the extent of grasslands and wetland habitats due to woodland encroachment and silting up of beels; and 3) grazing by domestic livestock. In Chitwan National Park (the second largest population), poaching alone does not account for the observed level of population decline (R.H. Emslie pers. comm.), and there are trends in a number of reproductive indicators (i.e., decline in the percentage of adult females calving and in the percentage of the population that is calves) that are strongly indicative of negative changes in habitat quality. In Chitwan, there has been severe infestation of some riverine and grassland areas by the climbing <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Mikania micrantha</span> (which covers over indigenous vegetation), and invasion of <em>Eupatorium</em> in other areas (Murphy, et al., 2013). There is also heavy livestock grazing pressure and disturbance in buffer zone areas as well as some invasion of grasslands by <em>Acacia catechu</em> and <em>Dalbergia sissou</em>.&#160;<br/><br/>In India, there is not yet any evidence that invasion by alien plants has caused any population decreases. However, in Orang National Park, there have been marked habitat changes due to grazing, human encroachment and silting up. In particular, short grass areas have declined by 75% due to silting up and draining of <em>beels, </em>lake-like wetlands with static water&#160;(B.N. Talukdar, pers. comm.). <em>Mimosa</em> is also an alien invader in this area. In the Karnali floodplain area of Bardia there is also some invasion of habitat by the alien <em>Lantana camara</em>. <br/><br/>In Pabitora, there has been an invasion of <em>Ipomoea s</em><em>pp.</em>&#160;""weeds"" and <em>Parthenium spp.</em>&#160;into grassland areas (S. Dutta, pers. comm.). There also has been an invasion of woodland into grassland and siltation and drying up of some water bodies. There also has been some human encroachment and very heavy livestock grazing. With increasing human densities this pressure is unlikely to get any less (S. Dutta pers. comm.). Analysis of satellite imagery has shown that there has a substantial increase in woodland (34.51%) in Pabitora since 1977 accompanied by decline in alluvial grassland (68%)&#160;(Sarma&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009). This change of habitat is mostly because of natural succession process, livestock grazing from the nearby villages as well as improper management of the grassland habitat (Sarma <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/> <br/>The West Bengal populations (Jaldapara and Gorumara) are affected by high levels of grazing from fringe villages, and there have been weed and climber infestations by <em>Mikania cordata</em>, <em>M. scandens</em>, <em>Lantana camara, Christella dentata,</em> and <em>Leea</em> spp. <br/> <br/>The species is inherently at risk because over 70% of its population occurs at a single site, Kaziranga National Park. This area, is subject to poaching and tensions with the surrounding high human population due to human-wildlife conflicts (including conflicts with rhinos). The level of poaching in Kaziranga has generally not been at a level to prevent the ongoing increase in the population, but constant vigilance is required. At least 12 rhinos were lost in the July 2019 monsoon floods, and numerous calves were rescued. Any severe catastrophic event in Kaziranga (such as disease, civil disorder, poaching, habitat loss, etc.) would have a devastating impact on the species.<br/><br/>During surveys carried out in February 2019, Jaldapara and Gorumara reported figures of 231 and 52 rhinos respectively - the highest numbers recorded during the last 100 years. There are suggestions that the two protected areas have reached their carrying capacities and suitable areas need to be found for the West Bengal populations. A male:female:unknown sex ratio of 3.8.1 has been reported in the Gorumara population based on dung DNA analysis (Borkathur, <em>et al</em>. 2016). As a result, fights among bulls are very common and these animals often stray out of the National Park, leading to human-wildlife conflicts (S. S. Bist, pers. comm).<br/><br/>There are suggestions that the small population of rhinos in Jaldapara and Gorumara may be prone to inbreeding depression (S.S. Bist, pers. comm.).<br/><br/>There have been proposals to dam the Bramaphutra River in Arunachal Pradesh, and should this happen in future things could very negatively affect the habitat quality and rhino carrying capacity of major parks like Kaziranga in future (by preventing or reducing the pulse of nutrients brought in by regular large floods). In Jaldapara National Park, the River Torsa no longer overflows as a result of massive flood-control structures. As a result the water table in Jaldapara National Park is receding and the natural water-bodies and wallow-pools used by rhinos are slowly drying up (S.S. Bist, pers. comm).","The total population estimate in August 2018 was estimated to be 3,588 individuals, with estimates of 649 animals in Nepal and 2,939 in India (B. Talukdar pers. comm.). The greater one-horned rhino, with strict protection from Indian and Nepalese wildlife authorities, has recovered from very low numbers in the early 1900s. Only 12 rhinos remained in Kaziranga National Park in 1905; it is unknown how many animals existed in the combined India-Nepal populations at that time. Although some populations have declined in recent years, overall the species has continued to increase for almost 100 years.<br/><br/><strong>India</strong><br/>The species exists in several protected areas in India: Dudhwa National Park, Manas National Park, Katerniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary, Kaziranga National Park, Orang National Park, Pabitora Wildlife Sanctuary, Jaldapara National Park, and Gorumara National Park. Kaziranga National Park, which was established as a reserve for the last 12 Indian rhinos in Assam in 1905, is home to more than 70% of the global population. A population has been re-established in Manas National Park under the Indian Rhino Vision 2020 program (Ellis <em>et al. </em>2015), where greater one-horned rhinos had extirpated in the late 1990s/early 2000s during a civil conflict. <br/><br/>Poaching rendered the species extinct in Laokhowa Wildlife Sanctuary by the mid-1990s (Foose and van Strien 1997). Stray animals are occasionally seen in Laokhowa and Burhachapori Wildlife Sanctuaries. There also were record from Valmiki Reserve in Bihar, which has habitat contiguity with Chitwan National Park (A.U. Choudhury, pers. comm.). The population in Katerniaghat is best described as transient (S.S. Bist, pers. comm.).<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Nepal</strong><strong><br/></strong>In the late 1960s, an estimated 65 Indian rhinos survived in Nepal, but due to increased conservation efforts, the total population grew to 649 in 2018. During a period of insurgency from 2000-2003, at least 91 animals were poached (Martin 2004) but poaching rates have significantly decreased within the last decade. In Royal Chitwan National Park, the population declined from 544 individuals in 2000 to 372 individuals in 2005 (IUCN SSC Asian Rhino Specialist Group 2007), but has since rebounded to 592 in 2018. In Royal Bardia National Park (where rhinos were re-introduced) there were approximately 40 individuals in 1997 (Foose and van Strien, 1997) and 37 animals in 2007 (IUCN SSC Asian Rhino Specialist Group 2007). The population reached a low of 17 animals in the early 2000s, but by 2018 has&#160;grown to roughly 30 individuals, including five animals&#160;translocated&#160;from Royal Chitwan National Park in 2016-2017. In Royal Suklaphanta Wildlife Reserve (where the species was also re-introduced), the population was only six individuals (Martin 2004, IUCN SSC Asian Rhino Specialist Group 2007) but by August 2018 had grown to 17, including two rhinos translocated in 2016-2017 from Royal Chitwan National Park. There is a tiny population in Parsa.",Increasing,"Historically, the Greater One-horned Rhinoceros once existed across the entire northern part of the Indian subcontinent, along the Indus, Ganges, and Brahmaputra River basins, from Pakistan to the Indian-Burmese border, including parts of Nepal, Bangladesh and Bhutan (Foose and van Strien 1997). It may also have existed in Myanmar, southern China, and Indochina, although this is uncertain. The species was common in northwestern India and Pakistan until around 1600, but disappeared from this region shortly after this time (Rookmaker 1984). The species declined sharply in the rest of its range from 1600-1900, until it was on the brink of extinction at the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century.<br/><br/>Currently, the Greater One-horned Rhinoceros is found in eight protected areas in India&#160;(Kaziranga, Pabitora, Manas, Orang, Jaldapara, Gorumara, Dudhwa, Katerniaghat)&#160;and in four protected areas in Nepal (Chitwan, Bardia, Suklaphanta, Parsa) (Foose and van Strien 1997, Ellis, <em>et al.</em> 2015, Emslie <em>et al. </em>2016). In India, rhinoceros from Gorumara National Park frequently visit adjoining forests; Nepali rhinos frequently visit adjoining areas in India.",This species is harvested illegally for its horn and other products used in Traditional Asian Medicine and as a status symbol in Vietnam and China. Myanmar has become the transit route for horn coming from India and Nepal.,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"The species has been included on CITES Appendix I since 1975. The Indian and Nepalese governments have taken major steps towards Greater One-horned Rhinoceros conservation, often with assistance from non-governmental organizations.<br/><br/>Greater One-horned Rhino populations occur almost exclusively within and around Protected Areas. In India, the species occurs in Kaziranga National Park (World Heritage Site), Manas National Park (World Heritage Site), Dudhwa National Park (re-introduced population), Katerniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary, Orang National Park, Pabitora Wildlife Sanctuary, Jaldapara Wildlife Sanctuary, and Gorumara National Park. In Nepal, the species occurs in Royal Chitwan National Park, Royal Bardia National Park (re-introduced population), and Royal Suklaphanta Wildife Reserve (a small re-introduced population). Stray rhinos are recorded in Laokhowa Wildlife Sanctuary, Burhachapori Wildlife Sanctuary, and Valmiki Tiger Reserve (A.U. Choudhury pers. comm).<br/><br/>Strict anti-poaching measures are needed to maintain all of these populations. It is also important to reduce human-wildlife conflicts around these areas, and this might involve fencing. Many of the areas also require targeted programmes to control invasive plants, to prevent the spread of woodland, to safeguard wetlands through appropriate water management, and to limit the extent of grazing by domestic livestock. In Pabitora, specific recommendations have been made to increase the quality of feeding habitat of rhino within the sanctuary through meticulous manipulation and checking livestock grazing (Sarma <em>et al</em>., 2009). Water holding mechanisms within the sanctuary during winter are crucial in terms of keeping moist grassland available in winter seasons, thereby reducing the number of rhinos straying out of the sanctuary and thus exposing themselves to poaching (Sarma <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>The Indian Union Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change has embarked on a project to create DNA profiles of all the country's rhinos in collaboration with WWF-India and the Wildlife Institute of India (S.S. Bist pers. comm).<br/><br/>The area of Kaziranga National Park has officially been extended, although animals had access to this area previously as the original park area was not fenced. In West Bengal (Jaldapara and Gorumara), there is a programme of habitat improvement in old teak areas, weed control is being carried out in 50-60 ha annually.<br/><br/>Grasslands in India are being improved through controlled burning and planting of fodder species. Artificial wallow and water conservation structure have been created. Jaldapara Wildlife Sanctuary had was upgraded to a National Park in 2012. The government of West Bengal has been developing an 21-km<sup>2</sup> site in Coochbehar District to accommodate surplus animals from Jaldapara and Gorumara National Parks, and other sites are being considered (S.S. Bist pers. comm.).<br/><br/>With the support of the IUCN SSC Asian Rhino Specialist Group, Indian Rhino Vision 2020 and a Nepal Rhino Action Plan (Government of Nepal 2006) have been developed. These cover a number of important and specific conservation measures, including translocating rhinos to bolster struggling populations and to start new populations (e.g., Manas National Park); improving security around rhino populations and reducing poaching; assessing habitat status and management needs; expanding available habitat through active management; improving protected area infrastructure; training staff in specific rhino conservation techniques; reducing human-wildlife conflicts; involving local people in rhino conservation; and implementing education and awareness programmes. Overall, there is a need for further reintroductions, thereby reducing the concentration of more than 70% of the individuals in one large population.<br/><br/>To further strengthen rhino protection in Assam, the government amended the Wildlife Protection Act - 1972 in 2009 with increased sentences and fines for poaching rhinos. Further, 12 fast-track courts have been designated in 12 districts of Assam to speed up cases related to wildlife species, specifically rhinos.",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

However, evidence from camera trapping and sign surveys indicates that densities are low, particularly in key sites, such as Sapo National Park, Liberia. Large areas of the original forest habitat, especially in Côte d'Ivoire, have been destroyed or degraded by commercial plantations of oil palm and other products, shifting cultivation, mining and logging, and hunting for bushmeat is increasing throughout the range (Mallon <em>et al. </em>2011, FFI and FDA 2013).&#160; Even if the estimate of 2,000-3,000 used previously was doubled to 4,000-6,000, using the lower end of the range (4,000), on a precautionary basis, suggests that the number of mature individuals is still &lt;2,500. A continuing decline of around 20% over two generations (26 years; Pacifici <em>et al. </em>2013) is estimated based on the extent of forest loss across the range in combination with an increase in hunting intensity, hence the species qualifies for listing as Endangered under criterion C1.</p>","The Pygmy Hippo is rarely seen because of its secretive, nocturnal habits and consequently not much is known of its ecology. The most detailed field studies are those by Robinson (1970), Bülow (1988) and Hentschel (1990). A general account of its biology is given by Eltringham (1999) and Robinson (1981b) compiled a detailed bibliography of the species.<br/><br/>The Pygmy Hippo is solitary except when a female is accompanied by young or during the brief association of a breeding pair (Robinson 1970, 1996; Robinson and Suter 1999). They are primarily, but not exclusively, nocturnal. Radio-collaring evidence showed that in Azagny National Park they were active mainly from late afternoon until midnight with peak activity between 16:00h and 23:00h (Bülow 1988). Recent camera trapping in Liberia and Sierra Leone has revealed that they may also be active throughout the night and also during the day. They spend the day hidden in swamps, wallows or hollows under the banks of streams (Robinson 1981a, Roth <em>et al</em>. 2004) or on drier ground within swamps (Bülow 1988). Pygmy Hippos follow well-defined trails or tunnel-like paths through the forest and swamp vegetation, which they mark by spreading dung by vigorously wagging their tail while defecating (Johnston 1906, Robinson 1970, White 1986).<br/><br/>It mainly inhabits lowland primary and secondary forests, close to rivers, streams and <em>Raphia</em> palm tree swamps (Robinson 1970, Bülow 1988, Eltringham 1999), sometimes being found along gallery forests extending into Transitional Woodland and the southern Guinea savanna. The habitat characteristics which appear to be most important are the presence of small streams with submerged trees, root hollows, swampy depressions, and the size and density of ground vegetation (Roth <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/><br/>Pygmy Hippos feed on terrestrial and semi-aquatic plants. In the wild, they are known to eat ferns, tender roots, grasses, herbs, stems and&#160; leaves of young trees, vegetables and fallen fruit; they have also been observed to&#160; eat sweet potato leaves, okra, pepper plants, cassava and the tender shoots of young rice plants on plantations and farms at the forest edge (Robinson 1970, 1996; Bülow 1988; Hentschel 1990), but are not regarded as crop pests. Robinson (2013) consistently found that a small, recumbent, vine-like forb, widely known as ‘Deewinkon’ (<em>Geophila</em> sp.) is a preferred food throughout Liberia.<br/><br/>Pygmy Hippos have been reported to feed for 5.8-6 hours per day, between mid-afternoon and midnight (Robinson 1981a, Eltringham 1999) but camera trapping has shown they may feed throughout the night. They may defoliate young trees by taking the base of the twig in its mouth, then shaking its head while pulling the twig through the mouth and they have also been observed standing on their hind legs with their front legs against the stem to reach ferns growing within <em>Raphia</em> palms (Bülow 1988). White (1986) recorded Pygmy Hippos taking fish from traps in Sierra Leone.<br/><br/>The stomach has four chambers (Langer 1988). The first three are covered with tough keratinized epithelium, only the last containing glandular epithelial tissue. There is evidence that microbial breakdown of plant material takes place in the first three stomach chambers, no caecum being present in this species. This mode of digestion is usually considered an adaptation to a highly fibrous, generally ""low-quality"" vegetable diet. The droppings are poorly formed and similar to those of the Common Hippo. Heaped dung and tail-splattered excrement are commonly found along trail-side vegetation.<br/><br/>Little is known about Pygmy Hippo ranging patterns, home range size or territoriality. Bülow (1988) radio collared five animals (four females, one male) in Azagny National Park, Côte d’Ivoire, and tracked them for 3-6 months (Bülow 1988). This study found that female home ranges overlapped and estimated that they covered 40-60 ha, while the home range of the male covered 150 ha. Bülow (1988) also found that the male Pygmy Hippo covered a distance of two km per day, whereas the longest recorded distance moved by a female was 900 m. Home ranges seem to depend on the presence of small streams with submerged trees, root hollows, swampy depressions, and size and density of ground vegetation, rather than nutritional factors or proximity of rivers (Roth <em>et al</em>. 2004). During the rainy season (May–September), animals are reported by hunters to disperse over wide areas in the forest zone.<br/><br/>No accurate data on reproduction, including breeding season, have been published for the wild populations. Sexual maturity occurs at about four to five years of age. From studies of captive animals (Lang 1975, Tobler 1991), the oestrous cycle has been shown to average 35.5 days with oestrus itself being 24–48 hours long. The average gestation length is 188 days. A single young is born with a birth-weight of 4.5–6.2 kg. Twins are born very rarely the incidence being approximately one in every 200 births (Hlavacek <em>et al</em>. 2005) The young are born on land and there is no evidence from captive births that a nest is constructed. A survey of over 800 births indicates that these occur throughout the year (Tobler 1991) although Robinson (1970) reports hunters observing newborns more commonly in the early dry season between November and January. Weaning occurs at 6–8 months. Reproductive maturity is reported to be 3–5 years (Lang 1975). Captive adult body size is achieved by three years. Maximum age in captivity is approximately 35–40 years but no while no data exist for wild animals.<br/><br/>In captivity, copulation has been observed on land and in water but, unlike the Common Hippo, birth takes place on land. Young calves do not follow their mothers around but are left ‘parked’ by the mother in secluded pools with the mother returning at intervals to suckle (Galat-Luong 1981). This explains why tracks of young animals are hardly ever found (Hentschel 1990), because young start following their mothers at around 3–5 months of age when they are already quite large.<br/><br/>In general, the range of the Pygmy Hippo does not overlap with that of the Common Hippo but they may once have been sympatric in a few places in Liberia (Schomburgk 1913) and northwest Sierra Leone (Teleki and Baldwin 1980, Grubb <em>et al</em>. 1998). Roth <em>et al</em>. (2004) reported that in Côte d'Ivoire along the Bandama River, almost as far north as the confluence of the Nzi, where they were still found together with the Common Hippo in 1986.<br/><br/>The effects of natural predators on the pygmy hippo are unknown, but the principal carnivores capable of attacking an adult animal of this size are the Leopard <em>Panthera pardus</em> (Robinson 1970) and Nile Crocodile <em>Crocodylus niloticus</em>. Hentschel (1990) obtained a photograph of a juvenile Pygmy Hippo killed by a Leopard and Roth <em>et al</em>. (2004) saw two animals that had been mauled. Young animals are vulnerable to a wider range of predators, including African Golden Cat <em>Caracal aurata</em>, African Civet <em>Civettictis civetta</em> (Eltringham 1999) and African Rock Python <em>Python sebae</em>.","The range of this species has changed markedly in the past 100 years (Robinson 1970, 1971, 2013), but most acutely in the past 50 years. Deforestation represents the biggest threat to Pygmy Hippos, with forests within their historical range having been steadily logged, farmed, converted to plantations (rubber, coffee and oil palm) and settled (Christie <em>et al</em>. 2007, Norris <em>et al</em>. 2010). An increase in mining and associated infrastructure development in recent years further threatens the remaining forests. What forest that does remain is fragmented, leaving Pygmy Hippo populations isolated, with demographic consequences and the increased susceptibility of small populations to local extinction (Mallon <em>et al</em>. 2011). Fragmentation has made the forests more accessible for hunters and there is now very little, if any, undisturbed forest in the region safe for wildlife causing the Pygmy Hippo to retreat into the diminishing fragmented parcels of forest (Lewison and Oliver 2008).<br/><br/>We quantified loss of forest in the range of the species using the Hansen <em>et al</em>. (2013) forest cover change maps. We used 300 m resolution maps (resampled from the original 30 m resolution to enable calculations to be computationally tractable). We calculated the approximate area of forest cover within the non-extinct portions of the species range in year 2000 (71,435 km<sup>2</sup>). We then summed the proportional forest loss (negative) and gain (positive) values between 2000-2012, which resulted in an estimate of a 5,010 km<sup>2</sup> reduction in forest cover within the range. Note that this calculation assumes that each loss is a 100% loss and each gain is a 100% gain within a pixel. We then rescaled the net loss to a 26-year period (two generations; Pacifici <em>et al</em>. 2013). The result is a conservatively estimated ~15% net loss in forest cover over two generations.<br/><br/>Although Pygmy Hippos are not generally a primary target for subsistence hunting, they are reported to be taken opportunistically by bushmeat hunters. There are also reports from some locations of Pygmy Hippos being by commercial hunters (e.g. Dufour 2002). They are killed predominantly for their meat and, unlike the Common Hippo, their teeth have little trade value, but many of their body parts, including the skull, may be used in rituals or traditional medicine (Robinson 1970, Hentschel 1990).<br/><br/>Whilst Pygmy Hippos are legally protected in all range countries, the level of enforcement is limited due to a lack of capacity in terms of human and financial resources and adequate training.","The total size of the wild population is unknown. The 1993 IUCN Status Survey and Action Plan estimated the population at ""a few thousand at most"" (Eltringham 1993). This estimate was cited as ""2,000-3,000"" in the 2008 IUCN Red List assessment (Lewison and Oliver 2008) who&#160; suggested that even that figure may be too high.<br/><br/>However, some much higher population estimates, originally published in GTZ reports (Hoppe-Dominik 1999) and in university theses (Bülow 1988, Hentschel 1990), have been made for Côte d’Ivoire. These have been assessed and summarised by Roth <em>et al</em>. (2004).<br/><br/>Density estimates were calculated from track and dung counts made along fixed transects during a long-term monitoring programme in Taï National Park. Hentschel (1990) estimated mean densities of 3.6 individuals/km<sup>2</sup> in primary forest, with a maximum of 7.6/km<sup>2</sup> in one locality, and 2.9/km<sup>2</sup> in secondary forest. On the basis of these figures, Roth <em>et al.</em> (2004) concluded that there may have been 10,000 Pygmy Hippos in Taï National Park and 19,000 in Côte d’Ivoire during 1982-1986, but that numbers in Taï had fallen to 5,000 by 1997. Densities in the east of Taï fell to 0.3/km<sup>2</sup> in 1998 and 0.2/km<sup>2</sup> in 2001 and in the west to 0.8/km<sup>2</sup> in 1995 and 1.4/km<sup>2</sup> in 1998; while the latest figures showed densities in the best areas of 1.4-2.5/km<sup>2</sup> (Hoppe-Dominik 1999, Roth <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/><br/>The present size of the global population is unknown, but it is widely considered to be declining based on the evidence of rate of conversion of forest habitat in the range, reports of poaching and the reduced densities in Taï National Park reported by Roth <em>et al</em>. (2004).",Decreasing,"The nominate subspecies is endemic to the Upper Guinea Forest of West Africa, occurring in four countries, Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The second subspecies, <em>C. l. heslopi</em>, formerly occurred some 1,800 km to the east, on the other side of the Dahomey Gap, in Nigeria from the Niger Delta east to the Cross River in Nigeria (Heslop 1945; and see Corbet 1969, Ansell 1972). There have been no reliable reports of this subspecies since 1945, and its continued presence seems unlikely (Robinson 2013).<br/><br/>The historic distribution of the Pygmy Hippo was far more extensive than the distribution today. Populations have disappeared from many sites and become fragmented across the landscape. There are confirmed recent records from localities in each of the four range countries and additional sites that have not been surveyed in recent years may still harbour Pygmy Hippo populations (Mallon <em>et al</em>. 2011). Full details of the current distribution are therefore unknown but a best assessment is provided by Mallon <em>et al</em>. (2011).<br/><br/>Liberia is at the centre of the species’ range and has the most extensive tracts of intact lowland forest in the region (Christie <em>et al</em>. 2007), with occurrence in the other three range countries primarily close to their borders with Liberia: eastern Sierra Leone, south-east Guinea, and south-west Côte d’Ivoire (Eltringham 1993, 1999; Grubb <em>et al</em>. 1998; Roth <em>et al</em>. 2004; Mallon <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>In Sierra Leone, Pygmy Hippo populations are found in the Gola Forest region bordering Liberia, around the Loma Mountains in the north of the country and along the Moa River, including Tiwai Island (Mallon <em>et al</em>. 2011). There are still rumours of Pygmy Hippos in the Outamba-Kilimi National Park in north-west Sierra Leone where it is possible they may survive in sympatry with the Common Hippo but there is no reliable evidence to confirm this.<br/><br/>The Republic of Guinea has a fragmented Pygmy Hippo population occurring in the forest zone of the south-east. There are records since 2000 from the Ziama Biosphere Reserve, Diécké Forest Reserve, Mont Béro Reserve, and also in Tinzou Community Reserve. Pygmy Hippos formerly occurred in Déré Forest in the extreme south on the border with Liberia but a survey carried out by the NGO Sylvatrop in 2009 found no evidence of Pygmy Hippo presence (Mallon <em>et al</em>. 2011). No evidence of Pygmy Hippos has been found in the Guinea part of the Cavally River (Robinson 2013).<br/><br/>In Côte d’Ivoire the most important site for Pygmy Hippos is Taï National Park and its adjacent zone of protection including N’Zo Faunal Reserve (Roth <em>et al</em>. 2004). They are also reported to be present in the Goin Débé Classified Forest, Cavally Classified Forest on the border with Liberia and Azagny National Park in the south-centre of the country (Mallon <em>et al</em>. 2011). <br/><br/>In Liberia the Pygmy Hippo population is divided between the two large remaining blocks of forest in the southeast and northwest of the country. The population in the southeast is centred on Sapo National Park (Collen <em>et al</em>. 2011) with recent records along the Duobe River to the north of Sapo across to the Grebo National Forest on the border with Côte d'Ivoire, as well as along Kia Creek in Maryland/River Gee counties and within the proposed Grand Kru-River Gee Protected Area (Mallon <em>et al</em>. 2011). Pygmy Hippos are still likely to occur in other forests between the Cestos and Senkwehn rivers, where abundant signs of their presence were found in 1998 (Robinson and Suter 1999). In the northwest, there are recent records along the border with Sierra Leone in the Gola National Forest and in the Wonegizi National Forest on the border with Guinea (Mallon <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>Records of the species from Gambia and Ghana were rejected by Grubb <em>et al</em>. (1998), while another isolated record from Guinea-Bissau (Cristino and Melo 1958) almost certainly refers to the Common Hippo (Robinson 2013).","Although&#160;Pygmy Hippos are not generally a primary target for subsistence hunting, they are reported to be taken opportunistically by bushmeat hunters. There are also reports from some locations of&#160;Pygmy Hippos being&#160;targeted&#160;by commercial hunters (e.g. Dufour 2002). They are killed predominantly for their meat and, unlike the Common Hippo, their teeth have little trade value, but many of their body parts, including the skull, may be used in rituals or traditional medicine (Robinson 1970, Hentschel 1990).",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"The species is included on Appendix II of CITES (as <em>Hexaprotodon liberiensis</em>). It has full legal protection in all range state countries.<br/><br/>Remaining Pygmy Hippo populations are primarily found inside protected areas (Mallon <em>et al</em>. 2011). Effective protection and management of protected areas is therefore key to the persistence and conservation of pygmy hippos. The largest protected area containing Pygmy Hippos is Taï National Park and its Zone of Protection in Côte d’Ivoire. Other important sites are Sapo National Park, Grebo National Forest, Gola National Forest and Wonegizi proposed protected area in Liberia, the Gola Rainforest National Park, Tiwai Wildlife Sanctuary and Loma Mountains Forest Reserve in Sierra Leone, and Ziama Biosphere Reserve, Diécké and Mont Béro Reserves in Guinea. Due to the fragmented nature of these remaining populations it will be important to ensure corridors are maintained between sites.<br/><br/>In November 2010 the Pygmy Hippo sub-group of the IUCN SSC Hippo Specialist Group and the Zoological Society of London convened a workshop in Monrovia, Liberia, to develop a Regional Pygmy Hippo Conservation Strategy to guide conservation and research activities related to the Pygmy Hippo. This was attended by representatives from government agencies, local and international NGOs, academic institutions and Pygmy Hippo experts from all the range states and internationally. This strategy, published in 2011, identifies objectives and priority actions needed to address the threats to the pygmy hippos and halt their decline (Mallon <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>In December 2012, the Liberia’s Forestry Development Authority and Fauna &amp; Flora International hosted a national action planning meeting during which an Action Plan for the Conservation of the Pygmy Hippo in Liberia was produced. The action plan adopts the same Vision and Goal as the Regional Pygmy Hippo Conservation Strategy and articulates objectives necessary to attain these in Liberia and necessary actions required to achieve these (FFI and FDA 2013).<br/><br/>There are now conservation and/or research initiatives directly or indirectly targeting Pygmy Hippos in all four range countries. Details of these are found in the Regional Pygmy Hippo Conservation Strategy (Mallon <em>et al.</em> 2011).<br/><br/><u>Captive Breeding</u><br/>As of 31 December 2013, the International Studbook for the Pygmy Hippopotamus records 353 living Pygmy Hippopotami kept in 133 institutions (Steck 2014). The age structure is, however, not very healthy. There is a lack of young animals and the sex ratio is skewed (38.53% males and 58.64% females, 2.83% unknown). 30-day mortality in both sexes is high: 33% in both sexes.",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

The Smooth-coated Otter is essentially an otter of lowlands and floodplains. Major threats to this species are loss of wetland habitats due to construction of large-scale hydroelectric projects, reclamation of wetlands for settlements and agriculture, reduction in prey biomass, poaching and contamination of waterways by pesticides. In most Asian countries where there has been increased human population during the last century, inadequate and ineffective rural development programmes have not been able to address the problems of poverty, forcing people to be more and more dependent on natural resources. Consequently, most of the wetlands and waterways do not have an adequate prey base for sustaining otter populations. Wetlands and waterways are polluted by eutrophication and accumulation of persistent pesticides. Increased pesticide use is not only regarded as a major obstacle to the development of rice-fish culture, but also poses a danger to all predators feeding on aquatic prey in the area. In the entire south and southeast Asia there is severe conflict between otters and humans, because of poverty and recent increases in aquaculture activities leading to indiscriminate killing of otters. In south and southeast Asian countries, prevalent poaching pressure is affecting its survival. Given the extent of loss of habitat that is occurring in south and southeast Asia and the intensity of poaching a reduction in otter population size has been observed in many parts of its range (Hussain 1993, Melisch <em>et al</em>. 1996, Hussain 2002, Nawab and Hussain 2012). It is believed that the population has been wiped out from most parts of its range in Iraq due to intensive poaching pressure (Al-Sheikhly 2012). During 1991 -2003 wide areas of reed beds and lakes of southern Iraq marshes were reclaimed affecting otter population, though recent surveys have confirmed their persistence from southern as well as northern Iraq (Al-Sheikhly and Nader 2013). In view of these, it is concluded that although the quantitative data on population sizes and trends are lacking, it is inferred that the global population of the Smooth-coated Otter has declined by more than 30% over the past 30 years (Pacifici <em>et al.</em> 2013).&#160;</p>","The Smooth-coated Otter is essentially a plains otter. In the Indian subcontinent they are adapted to live even in the semiarid region of northwestern India and Deccan plateau (Prater 1971). Generally, it uses large rivers and lakes, peat swamp forests, mangroves and estuaries, and it even uses the rice fields for foraging (Foster-Turly 1992). In southeast Asia rice fields appear to be one of the most suitable habitats in supporting its viable populations (Melisch <em>et al.</em> 1996). However, they were more abundant in the mangroves of Kuala Gula, Malaysia as compared to the rain forest rivers (Shariff 1984). <br/><br/>Along the large rivers in India, the Smooth-coated Otters prefer rocky stretches since these stretches provide sites for den and resting. River stretches with bank side vegetation and marshes are used in proportion to their availability especially in summer as they provide ample cover while travelling or foraging. Open clayey and sandy banks are largely avoided as they lack escape covers (Hussain 1993; Hussain and Choudhury 1995, 1997). In the Tarai areas of the upper Gangetic plains the Smooth-coated Otters use seasonally flooded swamps during monsoon (July-September) and in early winter (October-February). Winter being the breeding season, the swamps are extensively used as natal den sites and nursery. By February-March the swamps begin to dry and the fish biomass appears to be depleted, consequently the otters move to the perennial rivers (Hussain and Choudhury 1997). In west Java, the Smooth-coated Otters prefer mangroves and tidal stretches of the rivers and rice fields. Freshwater swamps and coastal stretches lacking vegetation are avoided (Melisch <em>et al</em>. 1996). In rice fields and pond areas they prefer sites having moderate diversity of vegetation. Rivers with moderate to slow or stagnant water and water bodies having a width of 10-40 m are preferred. In Huai Kha Khaeng, Thailand, the Smooth-coated Otters extensively use the slowly meandering river near the dam and the dam itself (Kruuk <em>et al</em>. 1994).<br/><br/>The Smooth-coated Otter is predominantly a fish eater, but supplements its diet with shrimp/crayfish, crab and insects, and other vertebrates such as frog, mudskippers, birds and rats (Prater 1971, Foster-Turly 1992, Hussain and Choudhury 1998).  In general, its diet is similar to that of Eurasian Otter. The range of fish in the diet varies from 75% to 100% (Tiler <em>et al</em>. 1989, Foster-Turly 1992, Hussain 1993, Melisch <em>et al</em>. 1996, Hussain and Choudhury 1998).<br/><br/>The Smooth-coated Otters exhibit the typical opportunistic feeding behaviour similar to the Eurasian Otter. Along the major rivers in India they eat more fish, often making up to 94% of the total diet (Hussain and Choudhury 1998), while along the coast in mangrove habitats and in rice fields it ranges between 75-100% (Foster-Turly 1992, Melisch <em>et al</em>. 1996). In west Java otters inhabiting mangrove areas eat more of crustaceans, around 22% of the scats contain remains of crab and shrimp where as in the paddy fields in Malaysia, along with fish they tend to eat more rice field rats <em>Rattus argentiventer</em>,  represented in 23% of the spraints (Foster-Turly 1992). <br/><br/>Hussain (1993) identified 12 fish species from the spraint of Smooth-coated Otter from the Chambal River, of which seven species were eaten throughout the year. <em>Rhinomugil corsula</em> (Mugilidae) and <em>Rita rit</em>a (Bagaridae) were the preferred species. At least eight species of fish were identified from the spraints from Malaysia (Foster-Turly 1992).  Some of these include Gourami (<em>Trichogater </em>spp<em>.</em>), Climbing Perch (<em>Anabis testudineus</em>), catfish (<em>Clarius </em>spp<em>.</em>), snakehead (<em>Channa </em>spp<em>.</em>) and mudskipper (<em>Gobioidei</em>). In the rice fields they ate large amount of most common fish (<em>Trichogater</em> and <em>Anabis </em>spp.). The size of the fish consumed varied from 5-46 cm, often ranging between 15-30 cm (Wayre 1978). No significant relationship was found between the calorific values of the fish and the quantities consumed. Thus, the prey selection by Smooth-coated Otter is mainly influenced by its availability (Hussain 1993).<br/><br/>The Smooth-coated Otter attains sexual maturity at twenty-two months in captivity (Desai 1974). Yadav (1967) observed first litter at four years of age. In captivity they mate during August to October in water followed by prolonged playful bouts between partners (Desai, 1974, Naidu and Malhotra 1989). Copulation takes place several times daily. Males are polygamous mating with up to four females (Desai 1974). In the wild in northern India mating occurs in August-September and littering in November-December (Hussain 1993). Desai (1974) observed litter size of 2-5 (mean = 3.25). Similarly, Naidu and Malhotra (1989) observed litter size 1-5. The breeding schedule of Smooth-coated Otters in the wild in India corresponds with the captive records (Hussain 1993, 1996). Evidences of littering have been recorded in October and the cubs were seen out of the den in February. The mean litter size along the Chambal River was three (Hussain 1996).<br/><br/>Based on the percentage of active telemetry recordings, Hussain (1993) observed that the overall activity pattern of Smooth-coated Otters along the Chambal River in India was in the form of a bimodal curve in which two period of high activity were separated by a period of relative inactivity. This pattern of activity varied considerably among seasons. In summer, the relative period of inactivity was greater than in winter or monsoons. A significant difference was also found between day and night time activities in different seasons. Otters were more diurnal during winter than in summer or monsoon. <br/><br/>Hussain (1993) observed daily movements of four radio-implanted Smooth-coated Otters of different age and sex within their home range. Two types of movements were identified; small-scale movements associated with foraging in a restricted area close to dens, and more extensive travels between dens and foraging sites. Most of the movement was restricted between 250 to 1,500 m. A typical group of Smooth-coated Otter consisting of male, female, and up to four young ones require 7 to 12 km of river for their territory and an even longer stretch of shoreline if living along the coast (Wayre 1974). During a radio-tracking study along the Chambal River, India, the home range of all the otters tracked overlapped intensively. Among the radio-implanted otters, the maximum home range was observed in sub-adult male and the minimum in juvenile female and male. Among the non-tagged otters, the home range of female with cubs was estimated as 5.5 km. In case of the adult male it was estimated to be approximately 17 km (Hussain 1993). Along the Chambal River, the home range length and area of smooth-coated otter was less than that of Eurasian Otter, in Perthshire, Scotland and North American River Otter <em>Lontra canadensi</em>s in Idaho (Melquist and Hornocker 1983), but larger than that of Eurasian Otter (Erlinge 1967) in Sweden.","Major threats to Asian otter populations are loss of wetland habitats due to construction of large-scale hydroelectric projects, reclamation of wetlands for settlements and agriculture, reduction in prey biomass, poaching and contamination of waterways by pesticides. In most Asian countries although there has been increased human population during the last century, inadequate and ineffective rural development programmes have not been able to address the problems of poverty, forcing people to be more and more dependent on natural resources (Badola 1997). Consequently, most of the wetlands and waterways do not have adequate prey base for sustaining otter populations. Wetlands and waterways are polluted by eutrophication and accumulation of persistent pesticides such as chlorinated hydrocarbons and organophosphates through agricultural runoffs. Increased pesticide use is not only regarded as a major obstacle to the development of rice-fish culture, but also poses a danger to all predators feeding on aquatic prey in the area (Melisch <em>et al.</em> 1996). In the entire south and southeast Asia there is severe conflict between otters and humans, because of poverty and recent increase in aquaculture activities leading to indiscriminate killing of otters. Many important habitats of smooth otter have been lost to development activities. In southeast Asian countries, there does not seem to be any intentional otter trapping (Melisch <em>et al.</em> 1996) though it is prevalent in India, Nepal and Bangladesh.","Because of the secretive and nocturnal behaviour of Smooth-coated Otter, reliable estimates of its population are not available. In southeast Asia it is found in large groups (Foster-Turly 1992, Hussain 1993, Hussain 1996) where the basic family group consists of an adult female and her offspring, the father of the offspring, and older siblings may often join the group (Lekagul and McNeely 1988, Hussain 1996). The group size varies considerably between months and seasons, the group being largest during the monsoon period (Hussain 1996). Along the Chambal River in central India the group size ranges from 1-9 individuals (mean=4.62). During a study conducted in the Corbett Tiger Reserve, in north India an estimate of 41 individuals (35 adults and 6 juveniles) with a mean of 5.1±1.55 was recorded from the 85 km of river stretch within the Reserve (Nawab and Hussain 2007).",Decreasing,"The Smooth-coated Otter is distributed throughout south Asia and southeast Asia. Its distribution is continuous from Indonesia, through southeast Asia, and westwards from southern China to India and Pakistan, with an isolated subpopulation in Iraq (Pocock 1941, Medway 1969, Hussain 1993). Though its current status in the Middle East is not known, its presence has been confirmed from Pakistan, India, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, southwest China, Myanmar, Thailand, Viet Nam, Malaysia (Penisular Malaysia, Sabah and Sarawak), and Indonesia (Kalimantan, Sumatra, Java) and Brunei (Mason and Macdonald 1986, Corbet and Hill 1992, Wozencraft 1993).",Species is illegally utilized in wildlife trade.,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"Since 1977, the Smooth-coated Otter has been listed on Appendix II of CITES. However, most range countries are not able to control the clandestine trade leading to extensive poaching. Nevertheless, it is a protected species in almost all the range countries which prohibits its killing.<br/><br/>The Smooth-coated Otter, once common in the wetlands and low lying areas of south Asia, is now restricted to a few protected areas. Creation of networks of Protected Areas, identification of sites as wetland of national and International importance under Ramsar Convention has to some extent halted the degradation of its habitat. <br/><br/>Over the years the IUCN SSC Otter Specialist Group has developed a cadre of biologist across Asia to conduct field surveys and has popularize otter conservation by promoting otters as ambassadors of the wetlands. However, concerted efforts to conserve this species are needed.

Thus while the distribution range is large, the spatial size of their occupied habitats is much smaller and unknown, particularly due to the widespread habitat destruction and pollution problems reported for much of the African continent. The impact of global climate change throughout Africa (Magadza 1994, Dixon <em>et al</em>. 2003, Hendrix and Glaser 2007) also has the potential of decreasing suitable habitat for otters and increasing human/otter conflict for increasingly scarce resources such as water, land, and fish. Both this decrease in suitable habitat and increase in human/otter conflict are currently occurring and will certainly increase over the next three generations.<br/><br/>This reassessment is based on a perceived (in regions where studies have been conducted) (Akpona <em>et al</em>. 2011, Reed-Smith in prep.) and assumed (in regions where no studies have been done) population decline over the last 16 years and beyond. In much of their range, populations of Spotted-necked Otters are faced with habitat loss or degradation, polluted waters, and/or degraded water ecosystems due to the introduction of exotic species such as Water Hyacinth (<em>Eichhornia crassipes</em>) and Nile Perch (<em>Lates niloticus</em>) and marginal agricultural practices. This habitat disturbance is exacerbated by poor sanitation infrastructure and growing industrial waste pollution. Additionally, regional human populations are poor and increasingly placing pressure on all resources including water, vegetation, the otter prey base,as well as reducing suitable resting and denning sites vital to survival of the species.<br/><br/>For all of the above reasons and the lack of effective conservations measures currently a continued decline in the overall Spotted-necked Otter population of at least 20% is projected for the next three&#160; generations (23 years; Pacifici <em>et al</em>. 2013).

While comparatively common in the great lakes of Central and East Africa, they are also found in streams, rivers and impoundments up to altitudes of 2,500 m (Yalden <em>et al.</em> 1996). In riparian and lacustrine habitats adequate vegetation in the form of long grass, reeds, dense bushes, overhanging trees and large boulder piles is essential to provide cover during periods of inactivity and for denning. Unlike African Clawless Otter, they do not occur in marine or estuarine waters.</p>","The Spotted-necked Otter is decreasing throughout its range, mainly as a result of the alteration or degradation of freshwater habitats and riparian vegetation. This rapid habitat loss is exacerbated by a growing, poor population engaged in unsustainable agricultural activity (Rowe-Rowe 1990, 1992, 1995) and unsustainable fishing practices (LVFO 2008). These practices have led to bank and shoreline erosion, denuding of important vegetative cover used by the otters, increased human presence which is disruptive to otter denning, increased use of smaller mesh nets and poisoning to improve catches, and the change or depletion of the otters prey base (Kruuk and Goudswaard 1990). Pollution of waters with agricultural, livestock, and societal wastes also are threatening with evidence of the bioaccumulation of organochlorines and other biocontaminants recorded in Spotted-necked Otters (Mason and Rowe-Rowe 1992). The rate of otters becoming entangled in set and discarded fishing nets is impossible to determine. However, based on known entanglement of other species it has likely increased over the occasional drowning reported previously (Stuart 1985, Rowe-Rowe 1990).<br/><br/>Otters are also killed for food or skins, as a perceived threat to poultry, or as a competitor for fish (Rowe-Rowe 1990, Akpuna <em>et al</em>. 2011, Reed-Smith <em>et al</em>. 2010). Introduction of alien fish species that out-compete the smaller indigenous fish was identified as a main threat for the Lake Victoria population (Kruuk and Goudswaard 1990).<br/><br/>Habitat loss and increased conflict with people is impacting all populations. The increase in human numbers dependent on fish as a source of protein is particularly threatening in the large East African lakes which are historically important refugia for this species. It has been reported that the introduction of Nile Perch into Lake Victoria and their impact on the diversity of the fish biomass in the lake is forcing a dietary shift for the otters (Kruuk and Goudswaard 1990). This shift in prey base has been observed (Reed-Smith 2010) but its full impact is unknown at this time particularly for areas outside of the protected national park where recent studies have occurred. The introduction of invasive alien species such as water  hyacinth (<em>Eichhornia</em>&#160;<em>crassipes</em>) is also degrading the water ecosystem.<br/><br/>The impact of global climate change throughout Africa (Magadza 1994, Dixon <em>et al</em>. 2003, Hendrix and Glaser 2007) also has the potential of decreasing suitable habitat for otters and increasing human/otter conflict for increasingly scarce resources such as water, land, and fish. UNECA projected in a 1999 study that portions of the Spotted-necked Otter’s current range would be experiencing fresh water stress and scarcity by 2025 with much of the rest of its range considered vulnerable to these hydrologic issues.","Like other otter species, its abundance and density appear to be dependent, in part, on the availability of fish; consequently, this species was historically common or fairly common in the fish-rich Central African lakes, but generally uncommon or rare in the rest of Africa where fish faunas tend to be poor (Rowe-Rowe 1990, 1995; d'Inzillo Carranza and Rowe-Rowe 2013). In an area that included a highland stream and man-made lakes in South Africa, Perrin <em>et al</em>. (2000) estimated one otter/1-2 km of stream, while in less suitable habitat Rowe-Rowe (1992) estimated one otter/6-11 km. In a more recent study (Kubheka <em>et al</em>. 2013) detected only 25% of the number of spraints located during two previous studies in an area of intense human disturbance but roughly the same number of spraints located in an undisturbed area during the latter 1993 study indicating a reduction in otter numbers in areas of increased human presence. In the Central and East African lakes, density was estimated at between one and two otters per kilometre of shoreline (Procter 1963, Kruuk and Goudswaard 1990, Lejeune and Frank 1990 cited in D’Inzilla-Carranza and Rowe-Rowe 2013). A more recent study (2006 – 2011) of Lake Victoria detected what could be a similar abundance on portions of the protected shoreline of Rubondo Island National Park but local sources reported a perceived decline in, or absence of otters along other portions of the lake’s shorelines.<br/><br/>Their abundance also appears to be dependent on suitable habitat cover (Reed-Smith 2010) which includes dense vegetative cover and/or the presence of large, piled boulder shorelines. Early studies of this species inhabiting large East African lakes and South African riverine systems reported observations of group size ranging up to approximately 20 individuals (Rowe-Rowe and Somers 1998, Reed-Smith unpublished data). Recent studies in East Africa (Reed-Smith <em>et al.</em> 2010, Reed-Smith <em>et al</em>. in preparation, and unpublished data for Tanzania, Kenya, and Uganda) indicate population declines due to habitat loss, water course changes due to drought, increased human populations, and increased eradication of otters as perceived competitors as well as for consumption and traditional medicine. Based on informant interviews in East Africa (Reed-Smith <em>et al</em>. 2010 and unpublished data) as well as reports from other range countries this species is seldom observed or not seen as often as it was 10 years ago and groups of more than five are rarely seen. Over the last six years, areas of Lake Victoria where otters were routinely observed, informants now report rarely or never seeing them.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, beyond these personal accounts there are very little data available on presence or status of this species throughout most of their historic range for the last fifteen years and only marginally more for the last 30 years. An additional problem in assessing their status is that throughout most of their range there is often no distinction made by local people between <em>H. maculicollis</em> and <em>Aonyx capensis</em> or <em>A. congicus</em> with which they can be sympatric.",Decreasing,"Spotted-necked Otters are found in lakes and larger rivers throughout much of Africa south of 10°N. They are common in Lake Victoria and across Zambia, but for some unexplained reason often are absent from what appear to be suitable habitats, such as the lakes and rivers, of East Africa and the Zambezi below Victoria Falls (Estes 1992). It is likely to be present throughout most of its historic range albeit, in reduced numbers due to habitat degradation, civil strife, polluted waterways, increasing human animosity towards this species, and use as a meat source (Reed-Smith 2010).<br/><br/>However, due to the paucity of current information their continued presence in Angola, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Chad, Côte d'Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and Sudan is presumed. The species is believed to be extinct in Burundi, Ghana, Lesotho, and Togo (Reed-Smith <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Current reports indicate the Spotted-necked Otter is present in reduced numbers in Benin, Botswana, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Congo, The Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Niger, Rwanda, South Africa, United Republic of Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe (Reed-Smith <em>et al</em>. 2014). The large lakes of Central and East Africa and possibly the larger river systems are important sites for the conservation of this species.","Otters are killed for food, for medicinal purposes and for their skins.",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Currently there are only a few regionally based conservation actions in place for this species (e.g African Otter Outreach Project, listed as Vulnerable in South Africa) and it is technically protected in all national parks.<br/><br/>They are present in several protected areas across their range but are little known and seldom seen by staff or visitors. Efforts should be made to educate range country park staff about all otter species and the role they play in a healthy ecosystem to increase awareness and protection for this species. This lack of knowledge by range country professionals is a significant conservation opportunity that can be taken advantage of by initiating an awareness campaign for all range country wildlife professionals. This campaign should be expanded to target human populations sharing their ecosystems with otters, particularly where traditional tales about otter behaviour are deleterious to the species future survival (e.g. otters rape women or raid young maize crops).<br/><br/>Another significant conservation action is taking steps to network with other field biologists working in ecosystems where otters are found. The creation of an easy system to report otter sightings would significantly contribute to our knowledge of their current distribution and aid researchers in future assessments of status and population trends in Africa where they inhabit areas that are hard to reach, or dangerous to survey due to the presence of crocodiles, hippopotamus, etc. Networking with other researchers to create synergy between conservation efforts also would benefit preservation of important otter habitats and ecosystems.<br/><br/>There is need for detailed studies on the distribution and current status of this species as well as conducting public relations campaigns to increase awareness of the presence of otters in Africa.<br/><br/>It is listed on CITES Appendix II.",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global
21936999,12421,Lutra sumatrana,Endangered,A2cde,2015,2014-07-11 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>It will never be possible to establish Hairy-nosed Otter’s pre-exploitation mainland range. Its populations are under rapid decline almost across mainland Southeast Asia, through trade-driven hunting (Duckworth and Hill 2008, Sheperd and Nijman 2014) and habitat degradation.This species is considered to be Endangered due to past population declines. The species is suspected to have declined by at least 50% or more in the past three generations (30 years based on Pacifici <em>et al.</em> 2013) due to illegal poaching and hunting, pollution, by catch and prey depletion due to over fishing. It is suspected that the current rates of decline will to continue into the future and further threaten this species. In its entire range the Hairy-nosed Otter is under increasing pressure due to intensive poaching. In Cambodia, around the Tonle Sap Lake and other places, poaching of otters and other wildlife is common practice. In Viet Nam, otters are hunted for illegal wildlife trade, for meat and medical use. Wildlife trade involving <em>Lutra sumatrana</em> as pets was recorded several time in Indonesia. The same is true for other range countries. The principal threat to the fauna of the Southeast Asia is the burgeoning human population, and resultant pressure of this growth on natural resources. Lack of adequate prey species and suitable undisturbed habitat are putting additional pressures on all wildlife species including the Hairy-nosed Otter. From these threats it is concluded that the Hairy-nosed Otter is under stress due to its restricted range, in which its habitat is under constant pressure and that there is every possibility of reduction in its population which has been inferred and future population is suspected to be under decline which may lead to decline in the area of occupancy, extent of occurrence and habitat quality. Combined with all these factors, extensive illegal exploitation of the species may lead to its extinction unless appropriate conservation measures are taken. Therefore, the species have been confirmed as Endangered under criterion A2cde.</p>","In Thailand the Hairy-nosed Otter lives in Phru Toa Daeng Peat Swamp Forests (Kanchanasaka <em>et al</em>. 1998). In Viet Nam it has also been reported from the low lying peat swamp forests of U Minh Thuong Nature Reserve in Mekong Delta (Nguyen <em>et al</em>. 2001, Sage <em>et al</em>. 2004) and from Cambodia it has been reported from flooded forests of the Tonle Sap Lake inundation zone (Heng 2007) and in Melaleuca forests and in mangroves and estuaries along the coasts. It inhabits freshwater and coastal areas, especially mangroves in Indonesia. Wayre (1974, 1978) considered that the Hairy-nosed Otter mainly inhabited mountain streams above 300 m, Medway (1969) recorded it in the sea off Penang.<br/><br/>The Hairy-nosed Otter principally predates on fish (85.5%) followed by water snakes. They also supplement their diet with frogs, lizards, turtles, crabs, possibly small mammals and insects, although these may not be that important in its diet (Kanchanasaka 2007). Fish belonging to the families Channidae, Belontiidae, Anabantidae, Notopteridae, Synbranchidae, Clariidae, Nandidae, were identified in faecal samples from Thailand. The main prey identified were Three-spot Gourami (<em>Trichogaster trichopterus</em>), Common Climbing Perch (<em>Anabas testudineus</em>), and snakeheads (<em>Channa</em> spp.) (Kanchanasaka 2007).<br/><br/>Not much is known about its breeding behaviour but there is indication that it breeds in November-December in the Mekong delta. Kanchanasaka <em>et al</em>. (2003) found that gestation was around two months as with other otters, and cubs were seen in December to February, and one family observed consisted of both parents and a cub. Based on camera trapping in Cambodia, mating season of hairy-nosed otter could be during between November and March (S. Heng pers. comm. 2014).","The Hairy-nosed Otter has a limited distribution range. In Thailand, the otters are found in the Toa Daeng peat swamp forests, and also from near the mouth of the Bang Nara River which is low lying and tidal. In Viet Nam, the species have been reported from low lying peat swamp forests dominated by <em>Melaleuca cajuputi</em> in lower Mekong. In Cambodia, the species mainly lives around the Tonle Sap Lake where the otters live mainly in the flooded forest and scrub surrounding the lake. Like many predators the Hairy-nosed Otter occurs in low density and the number and frequency of sightings are very few.<br/><br/>In recent years, the tropical peat swamp forests are under severe threat due to the increasing frequency of fires and other anthropogenic activities such as clearing of forest to grow plantations of oil palm and food crops such as rice, corn and soya bean. Forest is also cleared for fish farming. In Viet Nam the entire Mekong Delta has been converted into rice fields reducing the habitat of otter and other wildlife species into a few pockets. In Malaysia (Sabah), fire reduced 70% of the Binsulok Forest Reserve and 10% of the Klias Forest Reserve. This has affected the surrounding environment and the biodiversity. In Indonesia over the last 20 years, the ecosystem has been reduced from almost 30 million hectares to only about 15 million hectares, and most of what remains has already been logged selectively. Such levels of habitat modification have profound effects on the native biodiversity.<br/><br/>In its entire range the Hairy-nosed Otter is under increasing pressure due to intensive poaching (Yoxon and Yoxon 2007). In Cambodia, around the Tonle Sap Lake, poaching of otters and other wildlife is common practice. In Viet Nam otters are hunted for illegal wildlife trade, and also for meat and medical use.<br/><br/>Populations in Viet Nam are known only from two small National Parks that are under intense pressure from the surrounding dense human population. Though there are other areas within the Mekong Delta that could contain other populations, with Mui Ca Mau the notable example, most are too small in size and suffering from similar problems to U Minh Ha and U Minh Thuong National Park.<br/><br/>The illegal wildlife trade continues to grow and is the main factor behind this species decline. This trade shows no signs of abating and is likely to continue to push this species towards extinction. The natural low density of this species, its terrestrial ecology and its dependence on ecosystems that are often the first to be converted into agricultural land makes it extremely vulnerable to extinction.<br/><br/>The principal threat to the fauna of Southeast Asian region is the burgeoning human population, and resultant biomass demand which puts pressure on natural resources. Unavailability of adequate prey species and suitable undisturbed habitat are putting additional pressure on all wildlife species including Hairy-nosed Otter.","<p>In its distribution range the species is considered as rare. It has been studied in Phru Toa Daeng Peat Swamp Forest in Thailand (Kanchanasaka <em>et al.</em> 1998), U Minh Thuong Nature Reserve in Viet Nam (Nguyen <em>et al.</em> 2001, 2004) and in Tonle Sap from Cambodia (Poole 2003, Olsson <em>et al.</em> &#160;2007). However, their abundance or group sizes are not known. In U Minha National Park though it was estimated that there were around 50-230 individuals.

It is endemic to Southeast Asia. The type specimen came from Sumatra. Once believed to be extinct, the Hairy-nosed Otter has been rediscovered in many parts of Southeast Asia such as Thailand, Indonesia, Viet Nam and Cambodia. Historically, it occurred from southern Indochina to Malaysia (Sebastian 1995) and Thailand (Lekagul and McNeely 1988, Kanchanasaka 2000). In Thailand it has been reported from Phru Toa Daeng Peat Swamp Forest (Kanchanasaka <em>et al.</em> 1998).

21938767,1793,Aonyx capensis,Near Threatened,,2015,2014-06-14 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Although this species has a large distribution they are restricted to areas of permanent fresh water, offering good shoreline cover and an abundant prey base. Thus while the distribution range is large the spatial size of their occupied habitats is much smaller and unknown, particularly due to the widespread habitat destruction and pollution problems reported for much of the African continent. The impact of global climate change throughout Africa (Magadza 1994, Dixon <em>et al</em>. 2003, Hendrix and Glaser 2007) also has the potential of decreasing suitable habitat for otters and increasing human/otter conflict for increasingly scarce resources such as water, land, and fish. Both this decrease in suitable habitat and increase in human/otter conflict are currently occurring and will certainly increase over the next three generations (13 years).<br/><br/>This reassessment is based on a perceived (in regions where studies have been conducted) (Ray <em>et al</em>. 2005, Somers and Nel 2013) and assumed (in regions where no studies have been done) population decline over the last 18 years and beyond. In much of their range, populations of African Clawless Otters are faced with habitat loss or degradation, polluted waters, and/or degraded water ecosystems due to the introduction of invasive alien species such as Water Hyacinth (<em>Eichhornia crassipes</em>) and marginal agricultural practices. This habitat disturbance is exacerbated by poor sanitation infrastructure and growing industrial waste pollution. Additionally regional human populations are poor and increasingly placing pressure on all resources including water, vegetation, the otter prey base, as well as reducing suitable resting and denning sites vital to survival of the species.<br/><br/>For all of these reasons and the lack of effective conservation measures currently in place, the African Clawless Otter population is projected to decline by at least 20% in the next three generations (13 years based on Pacifici <em>et al</em>. 2013). The species is therefore uplisted from Least Concern to Near Threatened&#160; as it almost qualifies as threatened under criterion A2cde+3cde.","African Clawless Otters are predominantly aquatic and seldom found far from water. Freshwater is an essential habitat requirement, and they only occur in marine habitats where there is access to fresh water. In marine habitats, rocky shores are preferred (Van Niekerk <em>et al</em>. 1998). Elsewhere, they are found in diverse habitats, from impoundments, estuaries, and mangroves to desert conditions of the upper Doring River in the Western Cape (South Africa) and the Fish River in southern Namibia (Nel and Somers 2007, Somers and Nel 2013); they are also found in many seasonal or episodic rivers in the Karoo (South Africa), such as the Sak, Vis, Riet and Gamka Rivers, provided suitable-sized pools persist (Nel and Somers 2007, Somers and Nel 2013). They have been recorded up to 3,000 m in Ethiopia (Yalden <em>et al</em>. 1996). In Nigeria the African Clawless Otters is mainly restricted to brackish water streams (with mangrove vegetation along the banks) and, more occasionally, to transitional habitats between freshwater and brackish‐water environments (Angelici <em>et al</em>. 2005). African Clawless Otters have been found in towns and cities, and can occupy rivers with high pollution and eutrophication levels (Somers and Nel 2013).<br/><br/>The home range of the African Clawless Otters range length varied from 4.9 to 54.1 km and core length from 0.2 to 9.8 km. Total area of water used varied between 4.9 and 1062.5 ha, and core areas from 1.1 to 138.9 ha. As predicted using the resource dispersion hypothesis, total home-range length was correlated with mean reed bed (high food density patch) nearest neighbour distance. The pattern of home-range use by females was suggestive of territoriality. Male African Clawless Otters had overlapping home ranges, both with other males and with females (Somers and Nel 2000).<br/><br/>The African Clawless Otters prefer hunting at depths of 0.5–1.5 m. This is despite having a higher hunting success, catching larger, more energy-rich prey (fish), and shortest time foraging per catch, at depths of 1.5–2.5 m. Some of the data presented support the optimal breathing hypothesis, which predicts that both surface and dive times should increase for dives of greater depths. However, diving efficiency does not decrease with increasing depth, and percentage time at the surface does not increase with increasing depth. These are contrary to the optimal breathing hypothesis (Somers and Nel 2000).","The main threat to the species is the declining state of freshwater ecosystems in Africa. For instance in South Africa the state of main river ecosystems is very poor: 84% of the ecosystems are threatened, with 54% Critically Endangered, 18% Endangered, and 12% Vulnerable (Nel <em>et al</em>. 2007). Otter habitat has been either drastically changed or lost, following bush clearing, deforestation, overgrazing, siltation, draining of wetlands or water extraction or denudation of riparian vegetation (Rowe-Rowe 1995, Nel and Somers 1998).<br/><br/>In parts of their range, African Clawless Otters getting killed for skins and other body parts (e.g., Cunningham and Zondi 1991, De Luca and Mpunga 2005), or because they are regarded as competitors for food, particularly in rural areas where fishing is an important source of income, or where they are believed to be responsible for poultry losses (Rowe-Rowe 1995), and damage to young maize plants (Reed-Smith pers. comm.). Fisheries managers of the Kairezi River Protected Area in Zimbabwe blamed trout declines on otter predation and competition with trout for food, even though scat analysis revealed that only 1% of otter faeces contained the remains of trout and their diets overlapped only 17% (Butler 1994, Butler and Marshall 1996). Occasionally, they are accidentally caught and drowned in gill nets and fish traps (Rowe-Rowe 1990).","<p>African Clawless Otters populations are thought to be decreasing throughout most of their range based on assessed threats and decreasing reports of signs or sightings; however, there is a lack of research-based population status information over the last 15 years outside of South Africa.

It roosts in small colonies in caves, old and disused  buildings, temples, lofts of thatched huts, tiled roofs, hollows in  large trees and disused mines (Molur <em>et al.</em> 2002). It has a low  and fast flight and feeds on lepidopterans, coleopterans, hymenopterans  and other insects but does not feed on vertebrates.

In South and Southeast Asia, the primary forest habitats of  this species are under threat, usually deforested for timber, firewood  and agricultural purposes (Molur <em>et al.</em> 2002).

These threats are expected to continue.","This bat is usually found roosting in rock fissures and caves (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em>  2003) although it may also roost in tree foliage. In the Ankarana  National Park it often roosted in high points near the large entrances  of long caves with a high buffering capacity for temperature and  relative humidity (Cardiff 2006). The species' patchy distribution,  which includes humid, dry deciduous and spiny forest, is probably  related to the availability of suitable roost sites and <em>E. dupreanum</em> is  rare or absent from a number of forests without rocky outcrops (Goodman <em>et al.</em> 2005, Schmid and Alonso 2005, Jenkins <em>et al.</em>  2007). Although it continues to survive in highly modified landscapes with very  little native vegetation remaining (Ratrimomanarivo 2007), it appears  to use native forest vegetation for food in preference to introduced  plants (Picot <em>et al.</em> 2007).<br/><br/>Fruit is the main dietary component but it also eats leaves and other plant parts (Picot 2005, Picot <em>et al.</em>  2007). Through the ingestion of nectar and small seeds, a significant  role in pollination and seed dispersal is inferred (Picot <em>et al.</em>  2007, Ratrimomanarivo 2007). Plants are often found growing out of the  faeces beneath rock crevices occupied by <em>E. dupreanum</em> (P.A. Racey,  unpublished), which is also an important pollinator of threatened baobab  trees (Baum 1995, Andriafidison <em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><br/>MacKinnon <em>et al.</em>  (2003) suggested that <em>E. dupreanum </em>might be migratory (like its  congener in Africa, Richter and Cumming, 2008) because of regular  variation in the occupancy and abundance of roosts. Antibodies to Nipah,  Hendra, and Lagos Bat viruses, and isolates of other viruses were  detected in<em> E. dupreanum </em>at several sites in Madasgascar (Iehlé <em>et al.</em> 2007, Razafindratsimandresy <em>et al.</em> 2009, Reynes <em>et al.</em> 2011). Additional research is needed on natural history and in particular roosting ecology and movements.","This species is hunted for bushmeat across its range both at roosting  and foraging sites (Jenkins and Racey 2008, Randrianandrianina <em>et al.</em>  2010). Four out of nine <em>Eidolon dupreanum</em> roost sites in and around the Parc  National d'Ankarana showed evidence of hunting (Cardiff <em>et al.</em>  2009). It is classed as a game species under Malagasy law and although  it can only be legally hunted between May and August (Durbin 2007), this  legislation is widely ignored and the bats are hunted throughout the  year. Its roosts tend to be well protected from bushfires and it is able  to survive in landscapes with severely depleted natural food supplies  as long as alternative plants are available (Ratrimomanarivo 2007).  Since forest loss affects food availability (Picot <em>et al.</em> 2007) and may affect accessibility of roosts for hunting (Cardiff <em>et al.</em> 2009), deforestation and hunting are the main threats. Hunting accounted for a 30% desertion rate from 60 roosts (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em>  2003). Although hunters report that deserted roosts are recolonized  after a few years, there are several confirmed examples where this  species has been extirpated at roost sites (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2003).","The species' global population is suspected to have declined by 30% over the last three generations (generation length = 6 years; Pacifici <em>et al</em>. 2013) due to intense hunting, and the disturbance and loss of important roost sites. Estimates of colony size are difficult to obtain because the bats  are often difficult to observe in their day roosts, but is usually in  the range of 10–500 bats, with a median of 200 individuals (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em>  2003). The maximum roost count of 1,400 is from Parc National  d’Ankarana, in and around which the bats roosted in groups averaging 370  individuals in at least nine different roosts (Cardiff <em>et al.</em> 2009).",Decreasing,"This species is endemic to the island of Madagascar where it is widespread, albeit with a patchy distribution (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em>  2003). It is found in coastal areas and on the central high plateau,  although absence of records probably reflects inadequate survey coverage  rather than a genuine absence. There are some areas within its range  where the lack of suitable rock formations means there are no roosting  opportunities (Goodman <em>et al.</em> 2005).",This species is intensively hunted for bushmeat.,Terrestrial,"This species is known from a number of protected areas (Goodman <em>et al.</em>  2005) including, Parcs National d’Isalo, Namoroka, Ankarana and Tsingy  de Bemaraha, and Réserve Spéciale de Cap Sainte Marie, however, hunting  has been reported from within the Parc National d’Ankarana (Cardiff <em>et al.</em>  2009). Roosts that are located in inaccessible rock outcrops, in caves  with high entrances, or sites that are further from accessible savannah  appear to be relatively protected (Cardiff <em>et al.</em> 2009).

It is the most heavily harvested bat for bushmeat in West and Central Africa, and one of the most frequently consumed mammals in this region (P. Racey personal communication). Large pre-migration colonies are considered particularly vulnerable to any threats. In some areas this species is considered to be a pest and roosting trees may be cut down. Trees are also cut down in order to catch bats for the market (P. Racey personal communication). More recently, people are afraid of large concentrations bats due to Ebola outbreaks in Central and West Africa and may remove important roost trees to evict the colonies.","In general this is a common species forming large colonies of thousands to even millions of individuals. Within colonies, they form tight clusters of up to 100 animals, although in particularly large colonies this clustering may not be so obvious. Colonies may show extreme roost-site fidelity. During migration this species disperses into small groups. There is evidence of a widespread decline (P. Racey personal communication). A well-known colony in Kampala (Uganda) declined in numbers over a forty-year period from <em>ca</em> 250,000 animals to 40,000 in 2007 (Monadjem <em>et al.</em> 2007). <em>Eidolon helvum</em> is the most heavily harvested bat for bushmeat in West and Central Africa, and this is believed to be a major factor in reported population declines (P. Racey personal communication).",Decreasing,"This species is broadly distributed across the lowland rainforest and  savanna zones of Africa from Senegal in the west, through to South  Africa in the south and Ethiopia in the east (possibly ranging into  Djibouti and southern Eritrea).

There is a need to identify and protect important roosting sites, and a better understanding of the migratory patterns of this species would be beneficial to any conservation activities. The highest priority is to limit the harvesting of this species to sustainable levels. This would include an extensive community engagement programme in areas of important roosts and engaging all stakeholders, including government in the importance of this species. Under the Convention of Migratory Species (CMS) <em>Eidolon helvum </em>is a listed species and as such should be afforded protection in signatory countries.

22087230,18756,Pteropus rufus,Vulnerable,A2acd,2016,2014-03-31 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,This species is listed as Vulnerable based on an estimated population reduction of over 30% in the last three generations (18 years; Pacifici <em>et al.</em> 2013). The species can be legally hunted and the reduction can be attributed to the increased level of hunting particularly with the introduction of shotguns and continued loss of its preferred roosting habitats.,"It roosts in a variety of different tree species where the bats hang on the outermost branches (MacKinnon <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2003, Jenkins <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2007a, Long and Racey 2007). Roosts are very rare inside intact forest and are usually found in forest fragments, small islands or mangroves (MacKinnon <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2003, Jenkins <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2007a, Rakotoarivelo and Randrianandriananina 2007). Occasionally, <em>Eucalyptus </em>plantations are also used (Jenkins <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2007a). The majority of roosts are in small areas of relatively degraded vegetation with a few large trees. The roosts are usually adjacent to water bodies (Jenkins <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2007a) and it seems that bats use them for navigation and orientation during foraging (Jenkins <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2007a, Oleksy 2014). Roosting bats are easily disturbed by people and cattle that venture near the roost and colonies readily take flight (MacKinnon <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2003). Once disturbed the bats may move to an alternative roost site in the vicinity and it appears that each colony requires more than one roost site as a response to disturbance but also maybe to shifting patterns of food availability (Jenkins <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2007a). This species can survive in heavily modified landscapes through feeding on a mixture of native and introduced plants (Raheriaisena 2005, Jenkins <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2007a, Long and Racey 2007) but it shows preferences towards native vegetation (e.g. forest fragments). It travels up to30 km a night between roosting and foraging areas (Long 2002, Oleksy 2014). The average flight speed of commuting flights is over 32 km/h and the highest recorded speed is 61 km/h (Oleksy 2014). In Berenty Reserve, south east Madagascar, home range of over 58,000 ha was recorded for 15 tracked individuals (Oleksy 2014). During the gestation period the females appear to fly significantly longer distances than males, probably to fulfil their increased energy requirements (Oleksy 2014).<br/><br/>The diet consists predominantly of fruit juices which are squeezed from fruit in the mouth. Large numbers of small seeds are accidentally ingested during feeding and are later dispersed at other foraging sites, during flight or at the roost. The average gut transit time of these bats is 12 min, however theyare able to retain the seeds in their gut for over 20h (Oleksy 2014). There is some evidence that seeds that have passed through the digestive tract of <em>P. rufus</em> incur a fitness advantage through increased germination success (Racey <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2009). This has been recently confirmed on two species of strangler figs (<em>F. polita </em>and<em> F. grevei</em>) in south east Madagascar. Both species showed significant increase in germination after bat ingestion and had higher survival rate than seedlings originating from unprocessed seeds (Oleksy 2014) Other plants parts are also consumed, including flowers, nectar and leaves. In the south, nectar from introduced plants is an important dietary component throughout the year (Long and Racey 2007). Some plants have evolved to attract nocturnal mammals like bats as pollinators and <em>P. rufus</em> feeds non-destructively on the nectar of two threatened baobab species (Baum 1995, Andriafidison <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2006). Because of its ability to travel long distances and its capability as a seed disperser and pollinator <em>P</em>. <em>rufus </em>is widely believed to be a key species in fragmented forest ecosystems (Bollen and Van Elsacker 2002, Bollen <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2004).","There are numerous threats to this species. It is listed as a game species under Malagasy law and can be legally hunted between May and August (Durbin 2007). Only the few roosts that are located in protected areas therefore receive some protection (Racey <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009). <em>Pteropus rufus </em>is hunted across Madagascar (MacKinnon <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003, Rakotondravony 2006, Rakotonandrasana and Goodman 2007, Racey <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009) where it is an important subsistence food but also of commercial importance. Investigations in eastern Madagascar revealed that people in urban areas are twice as likely to eat this species than those in rural areas: over 40% of the people interviewed in urban areas had eaten <em>P. rufus</em> compared with only 20% in rural areas (Jenkins <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011). This proportion goes up to 60% in western Madagascar, with rural and urban areas combined (Razafimanahaka <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012). Although quantitative data on the supply of <em>P. rufus</em> for food and the impact of this harvest on colonies/populations is scarce, there is some evidence that the offtake is locally unsustainable (Racey <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009).<br/>Hunting occurs at roost sites and where the bats forage, especially when they feed on trees in villages (Jenkins and Racey 2008). A study during the austral winter in the western Madagascar town of Mahabo revealed that seven active hunters can kill 381 bats over a period of 43 days, with average of almost 4 bats a night. Over 80% of their catch is sold to the public . Hunters usually operate for around 90 days a year. There are up to 30 active hunters in Mahabo alone, so they could potentially account for 9,000 bats during 90 days of active hunting a year (Oleksy 2010). There is also evidence that <em>P. rufus</em> from Ile Sainte Marie is hunted commercially and frozen shipments are sent to the mainland port of Toamasina (Rakotonandrasana and Goodman 2007). The conversion of the forest used by roosting bats into agriculture is another threat to<em> P. rufus</em> and results in the permanent loss of suitable trees which in many cases have been used for decades. <em>Pteropus rufus</em> feeds on a number of cultivated fruits that have a high economic value in rural Madagascar and is often subjected to persecution.","Roosts are conspicuous and noisy but the bats are often tightly clustered making abundance estimates at the larger sites difficult. MacKinnon <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> (2003) reported that colony size ranged from 10 to 5,000 animals with a median of 400. They found that nationally 17.5% of 154 roosts had been abandoned in the last ten years and desertion rates were much higher (70%) in the central highlands. The estimated national population size in 2000 was 300,000 (MacKinnon <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2003).",Decreasing,"This species is endemic to Madagascar (Simmons 2005). It is one of the most widespread bat species on the island and appears to only be absent from the highly populated central highlands (MacKinnon <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2003). The highest density of roost sites is in coastal regions, especially from Morombe in the south-west to Antsiranana in the north (MacKinnon <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2003).",It is an important subsistence food but also of commercial importance.,Terrestrial,"It is listed on CITES Appendix II and is a game species under Malagasy law (Durbin 2007) but neither of these provide any practical in situ conservation measures (Racey <em>et al.</em> 2009). There are a few roosts in protected areas, notably Parc National Kirindy -Mité, Parc National de Masoala, Parc National de Mananara-nord (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2003) and Berenty Private Reserve (Long 2002), but many of the existing parks and reserves appear to be without roosting colonies (e.g. Goodman 1996, 1999; Alonso <em>et al.</em> 2002; Goodman <em>et al.</em> 2005; Schmidand and Alonso 2005). The ongoing process to triple protected areas in Madagascar is providing an unprecedented opportunity to include traditional roosts in the new conservation sites. There is also significant scope for local institutions to conserve roosts and this is already occurring in some parts of Madagascar where the bats use sacred forests (Jenkins <em>et al.</em> 2007b) or where communities have created social contracts to protect the bats (Jenkins <em>et al.</em> 2007a).",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

Argali are sensitive to deep snow, particularly if forage is limiting; often migrating from high mountain habitats during winter, but are present all year round at lower elevations in the Gobi desert (Reading <em>et al</em>. 2005; Murdoch <em>et al</em>. 2017a, 2017b). Most argali live on alpine grasslands between 3,000-5,500 m, often descending lower in winter (particularly if snow accumulates to more than a few cm). In some areas, (e.g., Gobi desert of southern Mongolia, Karaganda area of Kazakhstan), they live in lower elevation, semi-arid areas. They generally avoid forested areas (except in Kazakhstan, where they are presumed to occupy forests because of displacement from preferred habitats, Fedosenko and Blank 2005). They prefer to occupy open areas with a gentle slope; females generally occupy steeper (cliff) terrain following lambing. Argali feed on grasses, sedges, and some herbs and lichens, and they regularly drink from open springs and rivers (Wingard <em>et al</em>. 2011a). Where sympatric with blue sheep they are more likely to occur in grass-dominated communities compared to the sedge-dominated communities occupied by blue sheep. Argali are gregarious and live in groups from 2-150 individuals, with aggregations of 1,000 and more individuals reported from Tajikistan (Michel and Muratov 2010; Singh <em>et al</em>. 2010; unpublished data ANCOT). Wolves <em>Canis lupus</em> and snow leopards <em>Panthera uncia</em> are their primary natural predator, although smaller predators feed on lambs (Reading <em>et al</em>. 2009). Gestation is about 160 days, and females give birth to one offspring (twins are occasionally reported in the literature, but documentation is poor). Mothers separate from the herd to give birth and remain alone with her offspring for several days. Females are sexually mature at 2 years, while males may not sexually mature until 5 years; maximum life-span is 10-13 years (Fedosenko and Blank 2005).</p>","<p>The main threats are poaching (for meat), competition, displacement and possibly disease transmission by domestic livestock, and habitat loss. In general, argali appear to be extremely intolerant of human disturbance (Fedosenko 1999; Namgail 2004; Maroney 2006; Namgail <em>et al</em>. 2007; Harris 2007; Schaller and Kang 2008) although observations in areas without poaching and disturbance by livestock and dogs (see Young <em>et al</em>., 2011), e.g., the Kumtor Gold Mine and Sarychat Ertash Strictly Protected Area, suggest that argali can become habituated to human presence. International border fences present a barrier to movement and dispersal of argali, prevent access to optimal seasonal grazing sites and increase fragmentation and genetic isolation (Luikart <em>et al</em>. 2011; Rosen 2012; CMS 2014; Hussain <em>et al</em>. 2018). These threats appear to vary little among argali populations, even though habitats vary.<br/> <br/> In Afghanistan, poaching is generally considered to be a continuing threat to argali, the presidential ban on hunting notwithstanding. <br/> <br/> In China, poaching has been considered to be a substantial threat (Wang <em>et al</em>. 1997; Schaller 1998). In the mid-1990s however, a nationwide effort to confiscate guns from pastoralists substantially reduced the weaponry available for poaching. This, together with continued efforts to publicize the national law prohibiting killing protected species, appears to have reduced poaching during the last decade or so. At the same time however, efforts to regularize and sedentarize pastoralists generally increased habitat conflicts, because pastoralists typically intensified their use of productive grasslands preferred by argali, thus displacing them (Harris 2007, 2010). Additionally, industrial development in particular mining threatens the availability and quality of argali habitat (Harris <em>et al.</em>2009, Harris 2010). <br/> <br/> Some of the strongest data suggesting interference competition from livestock as a limiting factor for argali comes from Ladakh, India, where Namgail <em>et al</em>. (2007) and Singh (2008) documented argali shifting their habitat preference toward escape terrain and away from preferred foraging areas when livestock were present. Intensifying livestock grazing may cause fragmentation of argali habitat in Ladakh and prevent recovery (Bhatnagar and Wangchuk, 2001, Singh <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/> <br/> As elsewhere, livestock grazing and poaching were considered the principal limiting factors to argali in Kazakhstan by Fedosenko (1999b). FAO statistics confirm that livestock numbers are increasing in Kazakhstan and this affects the availability and quality of argali habitat. </p>  <p>There is general consensus that habitat conditions for argali improved after Kyrgyzstan’s independence in 1991, due to the collapse of the state-supported livestock sector and consequent reduction in grazing pressure in the Tian Shan and Pamirs (Farrington 2005). It is unclear whether relatively low livestock density near the Chinese border will continue. Poaching and competition with livestock are also considered threats in Kyrgyzstan (Weinberg <em>et al</em>. 1997). After independence in 1991, the number of domestic sheep herded into argali habitat declined dramatically, which likely had a beneficial effect. However, since 2000 there livestock numbers have again risen. <br/> <br/> The main threat facing argali in Mongolia is poaching for subsistence (meat) and increasingly for their horns, which are increasingly being used as substitute horn in traditional Chinese medicine (Mallon <em>et al</em>. 1997; Reading <em>et al</em>. 1997, 1998, 1999, 2001; Amgalanbaatar 2002b; Clark <em>et al.</em>&#160;2006). Also important are the impacts from local, nomadic pastoralists who displace argali, whose livestock feed on the same forage as argali, and whose dogs chase and even kill argali (Mallon <em>et al</em>. 1997; Reading <em>et al</em>. 1997, 1998, 2003, 2005; Wingard 2005; Amgalanbaatar <em>et al</em>. 2006; Young <em>et al</em>. 2011). More minor and localized threats include unsustainable trophy hunting (Amgalanbaatar 2002a; Zahler <em>et al</em>. 2004; Wingard and Zahler 2006; Reading and Amgalanbaatar 2016) and habitat loss resulting from rapidly increasing resource extraction (i.e., mining) (Reading <em>et al</em>. 1998, 1999, 2001, 2005). Subsistence poaching by miners general represents a greater threat than actual mining activities, but this may change as the number of mines continues to grow rapidly. These threats remain important due to poor or non-existence law enforcement throughout most of the range of the species in Mongolia. Very little money from trophy hunting currently supports conservation activities in Mongolia (Amgalanbaatar <em>et al</em>. 2002a; Wingard and Zahler 2006; Reading and Amgalanbaatar 2016).<br/> <br/> In Pakistan, in addition to disturbance from livestock (grazing in Khunjerab remains legal; Knudsen 1999, Khan and Khan, n. d.), increased access to the area through the Karakoram Highway is believed to have increase poaching pressure (Hess <em>et al</em>. 1997).<br/> <br/> Unlike in Mongolia, domestic livestock herds in the Russian Altai were reported as having declined during the 1990s (Paltsyn 2001), providing a potential opportunity for expansion of the protected area network in the Altai-Sayan area. <br/> <br/> In Tajikistan competition with livestock and harvesting of the subshrub teresken <em>Krascheninnikovia ceratoides</em> affect argali habitat. Poaching is the limiting factor in many areas except few hunting concessions, community-based game management areas and remotest regions (Michel and Muratov 2010; Michel and Rosen 2016). Projected climate change is predicted to cause shifts in the habitat available for argali (Salas <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/> <br/> In Uzbekistan, poaching represents the main threat facing Severtzov’s argali, which continues to occur even within protected area (N. Beshko pers. comm.). The second major threat to Severtzov’s argali is a loss of habitat and competition with domestic livestock for forage. Finally, inbreeding and harsh climatic conditions represent threats for the very small, isolated populations in the Aktau, Tamdytau, and Malguzar Mountains (N. Beshko pers. comm.).</p>","<p>Deriving a global population size from the available data is challenging. Numbers provided in CMS (2014) suggested a total number of about 107,000 argali, but our population information suggests a substantially lower number. Available figures are of varying reliability and refer to different spatial and temporal scales. Apparent increases in numbers are likely due mainly to more intensive surveys. Area-specific reports suggest locally stable or increasing population sizes, but over large areas trends of decline.</p>  <p><strong>Afghanistan</strong><br/> In the early 1970s, Petocz <em>et al</em>. (1978) accounted for approximately 1,260 argali in the Pamirs (including both Big and Little Pamir segments), from which they estimated a total abundance of about 2,500. During their survey in autumn 2004 (primarily of the Little Pamir), Schaller and Kang (2008) tallied 624 argali (87% of which were in the Little Pamir), and speculated that the total number might be 1,000. Some of the argali tallied in the Little Pamir may periodically cross into Tajikistan, and thus possibly be counted within surveys there. Harris and Winnie (2008) estimated that they observed 120-210 individual argali in the western segment of the Big Pamir in November-December 2007. Harris et al. (2010) used DNA microsatellites extracted from fecal samples collected in 2007 for a refined population estimate in the Big Pamir (northern slopes of Wakhan Range), yielding 172 (CI= 113-132) female and 249 (CI = 50-448) males. They consider the male estimate likely biased possibly because of movements in and out of the study area. They report further 106–191 male argali (no female) directly observed in Waghjir Valley in 2007. Observations in the border areas of Tajikistan (A. Bekmurodi, pers. comm. 2009, Kh. Karimov, pers. comm 2015) suggest that seasonally several thousand argali may inhabit the near border areas in the eastern Big Pamir and in the Little Pamir.<br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>China</strong><br/> Wang <em>et al</em>. (1997) put forward estimates of 29,000-36,000 for <em>O. a. hodgsoni</em> alone (in Tibet, Qinghai, and southeastern Xinjiang); although Wang (1998) subsequently wrote that such an estimate was probably a “significant overestimate”), with an additional 2,100-2,800 <em>O. a. darwini</em> (in Inner Mongolia), 600-700 <em>O. a. jubata</em> (in Inner Mongolia), 8,000-11,000 <em>O. a. karelini</em> (in the Tian Shan), 2,000-3,000 <em>O. a. polii</em> (in the Pamirs), and some additional <em>O. a. ammon</em> (in northern Xinjiang near the Mongolia border). This would suggest an estimate during the early 1990s of 41,700-53,500 argali in China. Later, as part of a nationwide attempt to generate numerical estimates for wildlife, Yu estimated the total number of argali in China to be between 23,298 and 31,910 (Yu Yuqun, Northwest Institute of Endangered Species, Xian, personal communication, 2004). Both of these estimates were extrapolations based on density estimates from limited areas, and neither was associated with sufficient explanation to assess their accuracy. Given the tendency for density estimates to be taken from areas known to have the densest concentrations and to use models that are usually biased high (Harris and Burnham 2001); these estimates are more likely to be biased high than low. <br/> <br/> On the Tibetan plateau, Schaller (1998) considered that “…the total number of Tibetan argalis could be as low as 7,000”. For the Tibetan Autonomous Region, Liu and Yin (1993) estimated 5,000 argali. For Gansu, in a letter to the US Fish and Wildlife Service dated May 17, 1991, Wang Zhangyun of China’s CITES Management Office suggested that there were as many as 20,000 argali in this province alone. In Qinghai, Zheng (2003) estimated a total population for Qinghai of 3,588. Earlier, Zheng and Zhu (1990) had estimated a population size of 665 (with a 95% confidence interval of 245) within selected study sites totaling approximately 600 km² of the Bu’erhanbuda Shan portion of the Kunlun Shan (based on 18 groups observed). Harris (2010) suggested that argali on the Tibetan plateau might be much less abundant than official numbers suggest and are likely declining.<br/> <br/> There are at least four written estimates of argali abundance in the Hashiha’er International Hunting Area of Gansu encompassing the northern slopes of the Danghenan Shan and the nearby Yemanan Shan in Subei County, Gansu. A provincial survey from 1990 estimated 1,452 argali (with unspecified confidence limits of 831-2,073; Gao Jun, Gansu Wildlife Protection Bureau, Lanzhou, unpublished data), an internal report of unclear origin estimated 1,525 (with confidence limits of 990—2,060; Zhao Lianghong, Subei International Hunting Area, unpublished data), Liu <em>et al</em>. (2000) cited a mean density figure of 0.482 (which is higher than either of the 2 density estimates underlying the above abundance estimates, and which equates to an abundance estimate of 4,479), and Liu (2001) estimated a population of 3,294 within Yanchiwan township (which roughly equates with the Hashiha’er hunting area boundary). All of these estimates relied on some variation of ground-based distance sampling, but in no case were sampling methods described, although Liu (2001) revealed that his density estimate was based on a sample size of 6, and the total number of animals observed was 60. A brief survey in April 1999 suggested that all these estimates were biased high (R. Harris, unpublished data). In an adjacent hunting area in Aksai county, Gansu, the 1990 provincial population estimate was 1,545 (with confidence limits of 1,127—1,963; Gao Jun, unpublished data), and the density estimate from Liu <em>et al</em>. (2000) suggested a population size of 3,879. In contrast, ~ 1-month-long surveys in both 2000 and 2003 with KIHA staff, focusing on what was believed to be the best argali habitat, documented 204-255 individual argali, and although some were no doubt missed, Harris <em>et al</em>. (2005) concluded that it was highly unlikely that the total population exceeded 500. </p>  Harris <em>et al</em>. (2009) found argali within Inner Mongolia appear to be restricted to extremely small populations (likely below 200 in total) and the future of argali there appears tenuous, most likely dependent on the ability of dispersing individuals from Mongolia to supplement existing groups or colonize new areas, although very little habitat capable of sustaining argali populations remains within Inner Mongolia.<br/> <br/> In Xinjiang, no estimates are available specifically for the Tian Shan or Altai Mountains (although estimates for the former are in the thousands, for the latter in the hundreds). In Taxkorgan County where Xinjiang shares the Pamir range with Tajikistan and Afghanistan, Schaller <em>et al</em>. (1987) documented only 87 argali and believed the population to be rather small. However, a later survey (Schaller and Kang 2008) yielded documentation of 851 argali in the Taxkorgan Nature Reserve and 1,448 argali north of it. In a separate survey during the same year (2005), Gong <em>et al</em>. (2007) surveyed selected drainages within Taxkorgan Nature Reserve, tallying 433 argali. Based on the area sampled and assumptions about suitable habitat, they extrapolated an estimate of 1,500-1,700 argali within the Reserve. No population estimates are available for argali in Inner Mongolia, but most populations appear to be isolated and small (Wang and Schaller 1996, Bu <em>et al</em>. 1998, Wang 1998). <br/> <br/> Due to the lacking of consistent trend monitoring, population trends in China are largely unknown. A population monitored periodically over 12 years in Yeniugou, in the Kunlun Mountains south of Golmud in Qinghai apparently declined (Harris and Loggers 2004). No marked difference in abundance was noted in a population monitored in Aksai, Qilian Mountains in Gansu (Harris <em>et al</em>. 2005). Surveys by the Wildlife Conservation Society in 2008-2009 found argali sparse on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and local reports of a decline in numbers, despite a lack of poaching (A. Kang, in lit. 2013, quoted in CMS 2014). We could find no more recent information for China.<br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>India</strong><br/> Fox and Johnsingh (1997) estimated that about 200 argali remained in Ladakh. Namgail (2004) counted 127 in a ~500 km² study area in the Gya-Miru Wildlife Sanctuary and adjacent Tsokar Basin in spring 2003. Adding unpublished recent reports of an additional 120-140 argali elsewhere in Ladakh, he concluded that there might be slightly more than 200 argali in the Ladakh. Namgail (2004) cautioned against interpreting these later numbers as an increase of the 200 estimated earlier by Fox and Johnsingh (1997). Namgail <em>et al</em>. (2009) estimated 300–360 <em>O. a. hodgsoni </em>in Ladakh. Singh (2008) estimated 480–620 individuals in eight widely spaced locations in Ladakh. Argali occur in very small parts of northern Sikkim along the border between India and China, (Tibet Autonomous Region), with an estimated 177 animals (Sharma and Lachungpa 2003, Chanchani <em>et al</em>. 2010). In the Western Himalaya, a few individuals occasionally move into the Spiti area of Himachal Pradesh from adjacent Ladakh (Pandey 2003; Devender Chauhan, Range Officer, pers. comm. 2017, Khanyari <em>et al</em>. 2019) and an unknown, but possibly large population, may exist in the adjacent Tsarap Chu catchment (Abhishek Ghoshal, pers. comm, 2018).<br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Kazakhstan</strong><br/> In the western parts of the Kazakhstan plateau (Ulytau Mountains) the argali population was extirpated in the 1950s-1960s and will most probably not recover without external intervention (Berber 2007). Fedosenko (1999b) reported that Smirnov (1965, not seen) had estimated 16,000 argali in Karaganda during the early 1960s, but that later estimates in the 1970s and 1980s had put the number at 7,000 or even 5,000. A helicopter survey in November 1991 resulted in an estimate of 9,717 Karaganda argali, but whether this was a direct count or an extrapolation was not made clear by Fedosenko (1999b). Fedosenko (1999b) quotes R. Baidavletov as assuming a total abundance of 13,500 in the Karaganda area, including 6,500 in Karaganda oblast, 2,100 in Semipalatinsk oblast, 4,300 and the remainder in other oblasts as of the early 1990s. Weinberg <em>et al</em>. (1997) guessed 8,000 to 10,000 in the northeastern distribution (<em>O. a. collium</em>), i.e., the Karaganda area, with perhaps 250 in the Kara Tau Mountains (<em>O. a. nigrimontana</em>), and an unknown number in the West Tian Shan (<em>O. a. karelini</em>). Magomedov <em>et al</em>. (2003) report tallying 449 individuals within a survey area of 1,544 km² in the upper course of the Baralbas River of Karaganda and Semipalatnisk, but declined to extrapolate this figure to areas not surveyed. The developed age pyramid of the surveyed population shows that the percentage of males decreases drastically starting from the age of 3 years. Surveys after 2000 revealed a disappointing picture of argali status (A. Subbotin, pers. comm. 2008). Uncontrolled killing by those who carry firearms appeared to be common; local militia and customs officials had come to areas inhabited by argali and killed dozens with gun-machines. In the Kara-Tau Mountains, Shakula (2000) believed that the population could have been as low as 100 animals. Surveys in fall 2018 (Shaymukhambetov <em>et al</em>. 2018) yielded records of 925 argali (1.27/km² surveyed area) in Severo-Vostochnoe Game Management Area (GMA) in northern Karaganda Province, 141 (0.45/km²) in Naryn GMA in the Tarbagatay and 279 (1.09/km²) in Zaysanskoe GMA in the Saur Range (both East-Kazakhstan Region). CMS (2014) presented population estimates of argali in Kazakhstan based on annual aerial surveys (latest data from spring 2013): 163 <em>O. a. nigrimontana</em>; 1,743 <em>O. a. karelini</em>, and 10,859 <em>O. a. collium</em>, and only about 10 <em>O. a. ammon</em>. Total number of argali in Kazakhstan (total for all subspecies) increased from 8,525 in 2005 to 12,775 in 2013. Official data (A. Muzbay, pers. comm. 2019) report an increase to 15,300 argali across Kazakhstan by 2017: 12, 300 <em>O. a. collium</em>. 2,500 <em>O. a. karelini</em>, 480 <em>O. a. nigrimontana</em> and 10 <em>O. a. ammon</em>. A. Berber (personal comm. 2011) confirmed an overall growth of the population of <em>O. a. collium</em> and its distribution range is expanding, but official data also suggest recoveries of <em>O. a. karelini</em> and <em>O. a. nigrimontana (</em>A. Muzbay, pers. comm. 2019<em>)</em>. <br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Kyrgyzstan</strong><br/> There is little consensus regarding the abundance of argali in Kyrgyzstan. According to Fedosenko (1999b), aerial surveys conducted during winters 1990 and 1991 tallied 5,493 argali, and estimated a total population of approximately 8,000 in the early 1990s. Luschekina (1994) counted 565 individuals in the western part of the Kokshalatau range in summer 1993. Based on these counts plus older, unpublished counts, she extrapolated an estimate of 6,000 argali in northeastern Kyrgyzstan. Weinberg <em>et al</em>. (1997) reported “no more than 2,000” argali in Tian Shan (which may have included parts of Kazakhstan), and estimates of from 9,900 to 16,000 in the Pamir and Tian Shan of <em>O.a. polii</em> subspecies (which included parts of Tajikistan). Weinberg <em>et al</em>. (1997) believed argali in both the Tian Shan and Pamirs were declining. Magomedov <em>et al</em>. (2003) surveyed 190 km of transects in a similar area during spring 2002, tallying 717 argali. Largescale surveys in key argali habitats across the country carried out in December 2010 and May 2011 tallied a total of 15,311 <em>O. a. karelini</em> and <em>O. a. polii</em> in the Issyk-Kul, Naryn and Talas regions and 37 <em>O. a. severtzovi</em> in Batken (Davletbakov and Musaev 2012). In Kyrgyzstan, official numbers for the years 2002 – 2017 vary between 12,000 in 2007 and 21,500 in 2013, with inconsistent numbers that very well beyond feasible population fluctuations (summarized information from National Statistics Committee and State Agency for Forestry and Environmental Protection, Z. Kubanychbekov pers. comm. 2019). The most recent official figure was 16,669 argalis in 2017 (12,628 <em>O. a. karelini</em>, 4,013 <em>O. a. poli</em>i and 28 <em>O. a. severtzovi</em>). Abundance varies greatly. Some hunting concessions with little livestock grazing and few protected areas (e.g. Sarychat-Ertash Strictly Protected Area) have high numbers and densities. In the overall mountain landscape, which is intensively used for livestock grazing and where poaching is widespread, numbers are very low.<br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Mongolia</strong><br/> The Mongolian Academy of Sciences has conducted a few country-wide surveys; however, the methods used do not permit accurate population estimation. Alternatively, they do provide some measure of population trends because similar methods were used. The methods involved several teams of biologists driving and hiking in areas known to at least historically contain populations of argali sheep and discussions with local people and local government officials in these areas. These surveys yielded round number estimates (lacking measures of precision) of 40,000 in 1970, 50,000 in 1975, 60,000 in 1985, and between 13,000-15,000 in 2001 (Dulamtseren 1970; Amgalanbaatar <em>et al</em>. 2002b; Zahler <em>et al</em>. 2004; Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006; Mongolian Academy of Sciences, unpubl. Data). Reading <em>et al</em>. (1997) suggested that no more than 20,000 argali inhabited Mongolia in 1994. The 2001 Academy of Sciences survey suggested that approximately 10,000 – 12,000 argali inhabited the Gobi Region of Mongolia (roughly corresponding to the range of <em>O. a. darwini</em>) and 3,000 – 5,000 argali inhabited the Altai Region (roughly the range of <em>O. a. ammon</em> in Mongolia). The most recent nationwide and local data were produced by a survey conducted in autumn 2009. Field teams sampled a total of 134 argali distribution units within Mongolia, which are estimated to occupy approximately 46,603 km² of the total area of 60,237 km² that was previously mapped as occupied by argali. They observed 385 groups of argali, totaling 3,373 individuals and estimated the argali population at 19,701 (95% confidence limits 9,193–43,135). However, post-survey concerns about sampling in some aimags (provinces) and estimates derived previously allowed adjustments that resulted in the best single estimate for Mongolia being 17,903 argali. Direct comparisons are difficult because previous survey reports lacked details of the areas visited, field methods, and analysis. Apparent increases or decreases in each aimag may be real, or may have been caused by differences in methods (Harris <em>et al</em>. 2010). Another survey in 2009 produced an estimate 26,155, reportedly an increase of almost 30 percent since a similar survey in 2002 (Frisina <em>et al</em>. 2010). It is difficult to conclude trends from these figures given the differences in methods and coverage, but on regional distribution data, it does appear that argali continue to decline in western and central Mongolia, while populations in eastern Mongolia appear to be expanding. Argali populations in southern Mongolia appear to be relatively stable. By opinion of S. Amgalanbaatar (pers. comm. 2019) the overall population is declining slowly, despite some increases in a few populations (such as in the southeast Gobi region). Probably no more than a few thousand Altai argali (<em>O. a. ammon</em>) persist in Mongolia, while several thousand Gobi argali (the putative <em>O. a. darwini</em>) inhabit a growing range in the south and east.<br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Nepal</strong><br/> No estimates of the number of argali in Nepal exist; it is likely to be a small number (Shrestha <em>et al</em> 2005) , possibly in the lower 10s (K. Suryawansi, pers. comm. 2020).<br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Pakistan</strong><br/> Animals (<em>O. a. polii</em>) using the Khunjerab area of Pakistan may also use the Chinese side; the number of animals occurring in Pakistan remains unknown, but is likely to be small, possibly less than 100 (Hess <em>et al</em>. 1997). In 2002 or 2003, Khan and Khan (n.d.) report observing 34 argali. Ali <em>et al</em>. (2017) observed a herd of 19 individuals in Karachanai Nallah, in Khunjerab National Park, in 2012. Haider <em>et al</em>. (2018) report numbers of immigrant argali in Pakistan from 1992 till 2012 varying between 31 and 168 with a declining trend the most recent figure being 41 in 2012. <br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Russia</strong><br/> In the mid-1990s, Weinberg <em>et al</em>. (1997) estimated that between 450-700 argali occurred in the Altai Mountains of southern Russia, distributed among numerous subpopulations none of which exceed 50 animals. Paltsyn (2001) reports counts of 80-85 argali within Altaisky Zapovednik (speculating that 100-110 individuals may have existed), 150-160 in headwaters of rivers of Sailugem Ridge (south of the Zapovednik, near the Mongolian border), and 40-45 individuals along the slopes of Chikhachev’s Ridge in the Tuvan Republic. A. Subbotin (in litt.) mentioned surveys of <em>O. a. ammon</em> conducted in the Altai Republic and in the Tuva Republic in 2010, during which in total about 700 argali were recorded in the Russian Federation, with 448 in the Saylyugem Range; the overall population in Altai Republic alone was estimated at 550–600 animals (CMS 2014). In 2019 WWF Russia and WWF Mongolia jointly estimated that the Russian-Mongolian transboundary population comprised of 4,851 argali with 1,431 sheep found in Russia (1,314 in the Republic of Altai, 117 in the Republic of Tyva) and 3,420 in Mongolia, suggesting a slight increase since the last survey in 2017 (WWF 2019). <br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Tajikistan</strong><br/> Numerous figures have been put forward for the total number of argali in Tajikistan but methodological problems make comparison and establishment of trends difficult. Luschekina (1994) reported that helicopter surveys conducted in 1991 tallied 9,415 animals, with the estimated total in Tajikistan being 9,900-10,300. Density was highest in the eastern-most section, near the border with China where a border fence limited human access. Fedosenko (1999a), based on local information in the Saluistyk River area, believed this estimate to be slightly low, asserting that population size in the early 1990s was 11,500-12,000. Based on poaching records and political events within Tajikistan at the time, Fedosenko (1999a) hypothesized a decline to about 9,500-10,000 during the mid-1990s. Fedosenko (1999a) reported tallying 4,948 argali in southeastern portions of Tajikistan in 1999 where he had tallied only 1,242 in 1995, and concluded that the population in Tajikistan had increased to 13,000-14,000. Other estimates during the 1990s by K. Kasirov (quoted by Schaller 2003) were in the 8,000-9,000 range. Magomedov <em>et al</em>. (2002, 2003) surveyed 900 km of transects during late February and early March 2002 in southeastern Tajikistan, estimating that they tallied 5,951 individual argali. Extrapolations from these counts (based on poorly documented assumptions) yielded an estimate of 14,500 argali within southern and eastern study areas, and 39,900 for all of Tajikistan (their surveys evidently took place where Lushchekina (1994) and Fedosenko (1999a) had earlier postulated this highest densities in Tajikistan). Schaller and Kang (2008) tallied 1,528 argali in summer 2003 within selected census blocks totaling 1,977 km² (and in winter 2005, counted 2,200 animals within their South Alichur block in Murgab). Schaller and Kang (2008) declined to project an estimate for all of Tajikistan, but believed that the 13,000-14,000 estimated by Fedosenko (1999a) was “of the correct order of magnitude”. During a survey covering 8,170 km² in the Eastern Pamirs in December 2009 a total of 23,711 argali in 510 herds were recorded with maximum herd size of 1,100, but varying densities with some large aggregations of argali contrasting with vast empty areas of suitable habitat (Michel and Muratov 2010). A part of the survey area where about 2,200 argali had been recorded has since been transferred from Tajikistan to China (Bitabarova 2015). Valdez <em>et al.</em> (2015) reported a slight decline in numbers from 8,649, 8,392, and 7,663 observed in the southeastern Pamirs during winter surveys in 2009/2010, 2010/2011, 2011/2012 with densities of 5.42, 4.91 and 4.49 argalis/km², respectively, but suggested that differences in numbers observed were probably due principally to differing dates of surveys among years. <em>O. a. severtzovi </em>may still number around a few dozen animals along the borders with Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan (Sharufiddinov, Rahimov, pers. comm. to S. Michel 2008; Rahimov and Amirov 2011), but in the upper Zerafshan Valley search in 2018 and 2019 did not yield any records (unpublished data by NBCUT and Tajikistan Mountain Ungulates Project).<br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Uzbekistan</strong><br/> The Nuratau Strictly Protected Area in the Nuratau Mountains Range hosts the largest population of <em>O. a. severttzovi</em> with estimated about 1,200-2,500 animals (direct observations of 500 – 1,150 animals) during 1994 - 2018. The numbers fluctuate but appear to be overall stable, with a slightly declining trend (N. Beshko, pers. comm. 2019). Outside of the protected area, the Nuratau Mountains supports few argali, most of them in the western sections of Nuratau Mountain Range and very few and only irregularly in the eastern Nuratau and Koitash ranges. No population estimates are available. Probably less than 100 argali remain in the Aktau Range. In the Tamdytau Mountains in the central Kyzylkum Desert Gritsyna <em>et al</em>. (2015) confirmed the presence of argali and captured with camera traps nine individuals, including adult males, females and lambs. The number of argali in Zaamin Strictly Protected Area in the Turkestan Range at the border with Tajikistan is not known. Further a few individuals may persist in the Malguzar Range near the Zaaminsk SPA. Therefore, a total of less than 2,000 Severtzov argali persist in Uzbekistan, of which 90% occur in the Nuratau Range (N. Beshko, pers. comm. 2019).",Decreasing,"<p>This species is found in northeastern Afghanistan, China (Gansu, Inner Mongolia, Qinghai, possibly western Sichuan, Tibet, and Xinjiang), northern India (Ladakh and Sikkim), eastern Kazakhstan, eastern Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, northern Nepal (near the Chinese border), extreme northern Pakistan, Russia (Tuvan and Altai Republics in the Altai Mountains), eastern Uzbekistan, and eastern Tajikistan (Fedosenko and Blank 2005). There are no recent records of argali occurrence in Bhutan (Tschewang Wangchuck, pers. comm. 2008). <br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Afghanistan</strong><br/> Argali were historically present in much of the Afghan Pamirs of the Wakhan district (Habibi 1977, Petocz 1973, Petocz <em>et al</em>. 1978), but were not known from elsewhere in Afghanistan during recent times. They currently occupy the western section of the Big Pamirs and adjacent parts of the Wakhan Range, most of the Little Pamirs, and are often found in the Waghjir Valley as well (Harris and Winnie 2008, Schaller and Kang 2008). They are also present in the eastern portion of the Big Pamir and are currently known to be transboundary with Tajikistan (Luikart <em>et al</em>. 2011). They are occasionally reported from elsewhere within the upper Wakhan Corridor. These animals are considered to be <em>O. a. polii</em>.<br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>China</strong><br/> Argali are distributed in most mountain ranges of Xinjiang (Yu <em>et al</em>. 1999), including the Altai Shan, Arjin Shan, Kara-Kunlun Shan, Pamirs, and Tian Shan and associated ranges. Some authorities consider all these argali except those in the Pamirs to be <em>O. a. karelini</em>; others sub-divide these into other subspecies. Within the ranges of the Tibetan Plateau, argali are distributed discontinuously and irregularly (Liu and Yin 1993; Schaller 1998; Schaller <em>et al</em>. 2007; Harris 2007). Although present in ranges from the Himalaya to the Qilian Shan in Gansu, argali on the Tibetan Plateau appear to be rare where temperatures are exceedingly low, winter snows deep, and/or precipitation amounts too low to support grass (Harris 2007). However, relatively healthy populations occur in the Qilian and Kunlun Mountains of Gansu and Qinghai (although from written accounts, argali are rare in the drier, western portions of the Kunlun Shan (Feng 1990; G. Schaller, unpublished data 2001)). Chinese sources report the species as present in extreme western Sichuan (Wang 2002) but recent documentation of this is weak. Most authors consider argali on the Tibetan Plateau (including the Qilian Shan in Gansu) <em>O. a. hodgsoni</em>, although some Chinese authors consider <em>O. a. hodgsoni</em> limited to southern Tibet, and consider argali north of that to be <em>O. a. dalailamae</em>. Argali are patchily distributed in Inner Mongolia (Bu <em>et al</em>. 1998), but Harris <em>et al.</em> (2009) found that argali have been lost from at least two areas considered to contain remnant populations during the 1990s by Wang and Schaller (1996): the Helan Shan and the Lang Shan mountain ranges. Disturbance and habitat degradation in a 3rd area, the Mazong Shan range, has likely caused the disappearance of argali there as well; small numbers of argali persist in the Yabrai (Yubulai) Shan range, the Hada Shan area and the Erenuo’ersumu region of Sunitezuo Banner. They are historically known from parts of Shaanxi and Ningxia Provinces (in the Helan Shan, which forms Ningxia’s western border with Inner Mongolia), but recent records suggest that they no longer occur in either of these provinces (Liu Zhensheng, Gong Minghao pers. comm., 2008). These animals are variously described as <em>O. a. darwini</em> or <em>O. a. jubata</em>. Harris <em>et al</em>. (2009) believe that <em>O. a. jubata</em>, as a subspecies with unique adaptations, has become extirpated and they did not know of any credible reports of argali from south of the Yellow River within recent historical times. Argali have long been extirpated from the provinces of Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Hebei. <br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>India</strong><br/> Within India, argali are restricted to the eastern plateau of Ladakh and Hemis National Park in Central Ladakh. There are occasional reports of one-two individuals moving into the neighboring area in Spiti (Himachal Pradesh) (Khanyari <em>et al</em>. 2019), and, separately, in northern Sikkim adjacent to Tibet (Chanchani <em>et al</em>. 2010). Indian biologists consider these animals <em>O. a. hodgsoni</em>. In Ladakh potential argali habitat was estimated at ca. 11,000 km<sup>2</sup> (Chundawat and Qureshi 1999), however much of it remained unoccupied (Bhatnagar and Wangchuk 2001). Key sites with argali in Ladakh included the Tso Kar basin, near Chumur, Kharnak, Phobrang and in the upper Indus Valley (near Skagzung), with very small populations scattered elsewhere (Bhatnagar and Wangchuk 2001, Namgail <em>et al</em>. 2009). A few individuals are known to occasionally visit the Kibber area of Spiti, Himachal Pradesh, while relatively large populations are also likely in the Tsarap Chu region of Himachal (Abhishek Ghoshal, pers. comm, 2019). The Tso Lhamo plateau is a relatively small area in the northern part of Sikkim but harbours a fairly large population of argali (Chanchani <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Kazakhstan</strong><br/> In Kazakhstan, argali (usually considered <em>O.a. collium</em>) are present in the central Kazakhstan Low Hills (<em>Melkosopochnik</em>) and in the Tarbagatay and Saur in the northeastern part of the country at the border with China. Wang (1998) listed the argali on the Chinese side of the border adjacent to the range of <em>O. a collium</em> in Kazakhstan as <em>O. a. karelini</em>. Small populations are also present in the Kara-Tau Mountains (<em>O. a. nigrimontana</em>, although Shakula (2000) raised doubts about the validity of this subspecies), and (<em>O. a. karelini</em>) in the ranges of the western (Weinberg <em>et al</em>. 1997) and northern Tian Shan (CMS 2014). Some experts believe <em>O. severtzovi</em> has been extirpated from Kazakhstan (N. Beshko, pers. comm.). Ishunin (1970) wrote that the subspecies historically inhabited the Beltau Mountains and eastern portions of the Aktau range. But the location of the Beltau makes such occurrence unlikely, while all mountain ranges with the name “Aktau” within the potential range area are currently entirely in Uzbekistan. In the Soviet Union in the 1950s, the borders between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan were modified and range area and available habitat suggest that Severtzov argali never occurred on the territories nowadays belonging to Kazakhstan, but possibly in areas transferred to Uzbekistan.<br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Kyrgyzstan</strong><br/> In Kyrgyzstan, argali are present in the southeastern and eastern quarter of the country toward the Chinese border from Kazakhstan in the north to Tajikistan in the south, as well as along portions of the western Tian Shan toward the Uzbek border (Fedosenko and Blank 2005) and the northern Tien Shan along the border with Kazakhstan. Animals in southern and southeastern Kyrgyzstan are usually considered <em>O. a. polii</em>; some authorities consider those in northern Kyrgyzstan <em>O. a. karelini</em>, but geographic and morphological separation remains unclear, with often the Naryn River taken as boundary between the range areas of the subspecies. Kashkarov (2010) suggested that the Fergana Range may divide the two subspecies. Davletbakov (pers. comm. 2014) suggests that the Alay Valley in the south of Kyrgyzstan is the most substantial natural barrier limiting connectivity between argali populations and that argali north of the Alay Valley more likely belong to <em>O. a. karelini. </em>In the Southwest of the country, on the northern slope of the Turkestan Range of the Pamir Alay System, in Batken Region, argali skulls have been collected in 2007 and 2013 (collector A. N. Ostashchenko) which resemble <em>O. a. severtzovi</em>. In May 2011 Severtzov Argali have been observed in Batken region (Davletbakov and Musaev 2012).<br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Mongolia</strong><br/> Argali (<em>O. a. ammon</em> and <em>O. a. darwini</em>) are distributed widely, but patchily across a large portion of Mongolia. Historically, argali occurred in disjunct populations across all, but eastern Mongolia, in areas with rolling hills, mountains, rocky outcrops, canyons, and plateaus (Amgalanbaatar and Reading 2000, 2003; Reading <em>et al</em>. 2001). Argali appeared to be expanding their distribution in eastern Mongolia, but contracting and becoming even more fragmented in western Mongolia (Mallon <em>et al</em>. 1997; Amgalanbaatar and Reading 2000; Amgalanbaatar <em>et al</em>. 2002a, 2002b; Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006). Large areas formerly occupied by argali in western Mongolia now lack the species. The species’ current distribution includes portions of the Altai, Trans-Alai, Gobi-Altai, Khangai, Khentie, and Khovsgol Mountain ranges, as well as isolated areas in the Gobi Desert (Amgalanbaatar <em>et al</em>. 2002b, Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006). More specifically, isolated populations exist in the mountains of the Mongolian Altai and Gobi Altai Mountains, primarily the western and southern Khangai Mountains, near the source of the Arsain River in the Khovsgol Mountains, and the southernmost Khentii Mountains. Other populations persist patchily in the Dzungarian Gobi, Great Gobi, Trans-Altai Gobi, Alashan Gobi, Middle Gobi, and eastern Gobi (Bannikov 1954; Dulamtseren 1970; Sokolov and Orlov 1980; Reading <em>et al</em>. 1997, 2001; Amgalanbaatar <em>et al</em>. 2002a, 2002b; Fedosenko and Blank 2005; Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006)).<br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Nepal</strong><br/> Argali (usually considered <em>O. a. hodgsoni</em>) are known from the Damodar Kunda area of Mustang District, bordering Tibet (Shrestha <em>et al</em>. 2005). They may also persist in the Dolpo region, north of the Dhualagiri Range (Wegge and Oli 1997). <br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Pakistan</strong><br/> Argali in Pakistan (considered <em>O. a. polii</em>) are known only from Khunjerab National Park (KNP) and environs, including the Khunerab, Kilik and Mintaka passes with China (Hess <em>et al</em>. 1997, Haider<em> et al. </em>2018, Khan and Khan n.d.). In Pakistan, argali now occurs only in one small watershed, in Khunjerab National Park, bordering China, which animals visit sporadically during summer (Ali <em>et al</em>. 2017). The visitation showed drastic decline over 20 years, possibly due to fencing at the Sino-Pakistan border and dietary competition with wild herbivores (Haider <em>et al</em>. 2018). It is unknown whether argali also use the mountains separating these areas from Afghanistan’s Little Pamir to the northwest. <br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Russia</strong><br/> Argali (considered <em>O. a. ammon</em>) were formerly found in Zabaikal, Kuray, and the South-Chuya ranges and the Ukok plateau (Weinberg <em>et al</em>. 1997). More recently, they are known only from Tuva and Altai Republics (Weinberg <em>et al</em>. 1997; Paltsyn 2001; Maroney 2004; Paltsyn <em>et al</em>. 2011). <br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Tajikistan</strong><br/> Argali (<em>O. a. polii)</em> are present through most of the eastern third of Tajikistan (Lushchekina 1994, Weinberg <em>et al</em>. 1997, Schaller and Kang 2008, Michel and Muratov 2010), from the border with Xinjiang, China, in the south along the border with Afghanistan west to Langar, in the center west to Sarez Lake, and along the border with Kyrgyzstan west to Altyn Mazar. In the northwest of the country, <a name=""move35410035"">Severtzov argali <em>O. a. severtzovi </em>have been documented by skulls and reports from local people in 2011 and by direct observations in 2014 (data by NBCUT and Tajikistan Mountain Ungulates Project) </a>on the southern slopes of western Turkestan Range near the border with Uzbekistan and in the upper Zerafshan Valley in both, Turkestan and Zerafshan ranges. <a name=""move354100351"">Severtzov argali <em>O. a. severtzovi </em>have been documented by skulls and reports from local people in 2011 and by direct observations in 2014 (data by NBCUT and Tajikistan Mountain Ungulates Project). </a>In the western Turkestan Range in fall 2015 an argali ram was captured in fall 2018 (Michel, pers. comm. by Zerafshan National Park ranger 2018) and a hunting outfitter advertised in social media an alleged Severtzov argali killed from Tajikistan in February 2015. Searches in 2018 and 2019 in the upper Zerafshan Valley did not yield any records and argalis are possibly extirpated there now (unpublished data by NBCUT and Tajikistan Mountain Ungulates Project).<br/> <br/><u> Uzbekistan</u><br/> <em>O. ammon severtzovi</em> was previously distributed over a wide area of Uzbekistan from the northeastern part of the Pamiro-Alaya mountain range thoughout the low mountains of the Kyzylkum Desert. Historically, it occupied the mountains of Nuratau, Aktau, Koytash, Malguzar and Turkenstan Range as well as Pistalitau, Tamdytau, Bukantua, Kuldjuktau, and other low ranges in the Kyzylkum Desert (Ishunin 1970; N. Beshko, pers. comm.). Today, the majority of animals are restricted to the Nuratau Range, primarily within the Nuratau Strictly Protected Area and a small population in the western part of this mountain range (N. Beshko pers. comm. 2019). Very small populations persist (N. Beshko, pers. comm. 2019) in the Turkestan, western Aktau, Tamdytau (confirmed by Grytsina <em>et al</em>. 2015), and possibly Malguzar ranges, but not any more permanently in the Koytash Mountains. Previously, <em>O. a. karelini</em> also occurred in the western Tien Shan in Uzbekistan, but no records are known for the last several decades (S. Zagrebin, pers. comm. 2018). </p>",,Terrestrial,"Argali are included on Appendix II of CITES (since 2019 each subspecies as a separate species <em>O. ammon</em>, <em>O. collium</em>, <em>O. darwini</em>, <em>O. jubata</em>, <em>O. karelini</em>, <em>O. polii</em> and <em>O. severtzovi</em>), except the subspecies <em>O. a. nigrimontana</em> and <em>O. a. hodgsonii</em>, which are included on Appendix I as the species <em>O. hodgsoni</em> and <em>O. nigrimontana</em>. The United States Endangered Species Act lists argali as endangered, except in Mongolia, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan, where they are listed as threatened. (Threatened classification allows for importation of trophies from legally taken argali in those countries under specifically-authorized permits from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Permits for importation of trophies are generally not authorized for taxa listed as Endangered).<br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Afghanistan</strong><br/> A trophy hunting program for argali in the Big Pamir operated from ~ 1966-1978, but was discontinued following the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, and to date, has not been re-established. Under this program, livestock grazing in high elevation habitats favoured by argali during summer was effectively prohibited, and poaching by local pastoralists reduced. However, domestic livestock grazing was concentrated on argali winter ranges, with the result that the overall effect on argali habitat of the hunting program was unclear (Petocz <em>et al</em>. 1978). All hunting in Afghanistan was banned by order of President in 2006. In addition, argali is specifically listed as a protected species under Article 47 of the Environment Law of 2007. There do not, however, appear to be serious effort so to enforce the ban. In 2009, argali were officially-listed as a Protected Species in Afghanistan, strictly prohibiting all hunting and trading of this species within the country. The distribution of argali in Afghanistan is entirely within the Wakhan National Park, established in 2014. The national park allows for the continuation of pastoral land use.<br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>China</strong><br/> Argali are classified as a Category II “key species” under the Chinese National Wildlife Law of 1988. As such, permits to take argali must be obtained from province-level authorities. In practice, only the trophy hunting programs have procured permits to take argali under this legislation (Harris 2007). <br/> <br/> Argali occur in a number of Chinese nature reserves. In Xinjiang, they occur in at least six nature reserves in Xinjiang (Du and Zhang 2006), including Arjin Shan, Kalamaili, Source of the 2 Altai Rivers (Altai mountains), West Tian Shan, Hami Shan (Tian Shan range) and Taxkorgan (Pamirs). On the Tibetan Plateau, argali occur in the 247,120 km² Qiangtang Reserve in Tibet and the 83,000 km² Kekexili Reserve in Qinghai, as well as in scattered populations within the Sanjiangyuan Nature Reserve in Qinghai (Schaller <em>et al</em>. 2007). In Gansu, argali occur in Yanchiwan Nature Reserve, and may occur in the Qilian Nature Reserve. Nature reserve designation in China does not necessarily preclude habitat conflicts, as grazing, mining, and other activities often take place.<br/> <br/> A number of trophy hunting areas have been established with argali as the focal species. Hunting areas in Xinjiang include Baicheng, Bu’erjin, Fuyun, Hami, Hejing, Qiemo, Tacheng, Tashiku’ergan, and Tulufan counties; in Gansu in Aksai and Subei counties (Subei’s consisted of two distinct areas, the Hashiha’er area in the Qilian Mountains and the Mazong Shan area in the Gobi Desert abutting Mongolia). In addition, two hunting areas in Qinghai Province, focusing primarily on blue sheep, have argali populations: Dulan (within separate townships, Balong and Gouli) and Maduo counties. One hunting area in Inner Mongolia (Yabulei) contains argali. Hunting areas in China have generally succeeded in reducing poaching and in generating some local enthusiasm for argali, but have not yet succeeded in treating habitat conflicts (Harris and Pletscher 2002; Harris 2007). Since 2006, China has suspended argali trophy hunting. <br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>India</strong><br/> Argali are listed under Schedule I (highest protection) of the Wildlife Protection Act (1972) of the Government of India (Fox and Johnsingh 1997). Poaching appears to have declined in recent years (Namgail 2004), but has evidently not been accompanied by an increase in argali. Little seems to have been done to address the likely deleterious effects of displacement increasing numbers of livestock on argali in Ladakh. Argali are rare but present in Khangchengzonga National Park in Sikkim and the Tso Lhamo plateau, where there is some threat from yaks and other livestock (Sharma and Lachungpa 2003). Bhatnagar and Wangchuk (2001) felt that even though most of the argali range in Ladakh is protected under the Changthang Wildlife Sanctuary (ca. 10,000 km<sup>2</sup>) and part of the Hemis National Park (ca. 4,000km<sup>2</sup>), the small and fragmented populations may have poor chances of recovery in a scenario where livestock pressure persists. Recent surveys, however, point to recovery of argali in small pockets of eastern Ladakh that may be due to locally declining pastoral use by the nomads opting for alternative livelihoods (M. Khanyari, pers. comm, 2020). A positive development for all mountain areas in India is the implementation of a national landscape-level, participatory strategy called the Project Snow Leopard, which is bringing in better planning, training and funds for conservation of species in both protected and unprotected areas of the Himalaya.<br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Kazakhstan</strong><br/> The species is listed in the Red Book and thereby legally protected from any take. Hunting permits are issued only by particular governmental decree following a special procedure, but there have been no legal hunts since 2003. Fedosenko (1999b) considered that some of the hunting concessions in Karaganda Oblast protected argali well. Between 1990 and 2000, 75 argali rams were shot in the Karaganda area, and the approximately $900,000 earned was used for scientific studies, according to Fedosenko (1999b). However, Fedosenko (1999b) also believed that trophy hunting was having deleterious effects on breeding behavior and resultant productivity of females, and recommended a reduction in the yearly offtake quota. Currently the lack of hunting options for argali is a disincentive to their protection and the conservation of their habitats (Shaymukhambetov <em>et al</em>. 2018). Trends in habitat conflicts with domestic livestock in Kazakhstan have not been well documented.<br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Kyrgyzstan</strong><br/> Argali is listed in the Red Book of the Kyrgyz Republic and thus legally protected. Only a limited number of permits are issued annually to private hunting concessions (Michel and Rosen 2016). The Sarychat-Ertash Strictly Protected Area is the habitat of an argali population shared with adjacent hunting concessions.<br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Mongolia</strong><br/> Argali sheep are protected as “Rare” under the 2001 revision (Mongolian Government Act No. 264) of the 2000 Mongolian Law on Animals (Wingard and Odgerel 2002). General hunting of argali has been prohibited since 1953, and is the species is further protected as “Rare” under the 1995 Mongolian Hunting Law (Wingard and Odgerel 2002). Argali are included in Appendix II of CITES (UNEP-WCMC, 2006), with an export quota of 80 hunting trophies with horns and 44 skins and horns in 2005. Altai argali (<em>O. a. ammon</em>) were listed as Rare” in both the 1987 and 1997 Mongolian Red Books, and the species was upgraded to “Endangered” in Mongolia in the most recent nationwide assessment (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006). Approximately 14% of the species’ range in Mongolia occurs within federal protected areas, including Altai Taivan Bogd National Conservation Park (NCP), Gobi Gurvan Saikhan NCP, Great Gobi Strictly Protected Area (SPA) sections A and B, Ikh Nart NR, Khokh Serkh SPA, Khoredal Saridag SPA, Khustai Nuruu NCP, Myangan Ugalzat National Conservation Park, Siilkhem SPA, Tsagaan Shuvuut SPA, Tsambagarav SPA, and Turgen Uul SPA (Amgalanbaatar <em>et al</em>. 2002b). Small populations likely occur in other federal and provincial (aimag) or county (soum) protected areas as well.<br/> <br/> Although protected from general hunting, trophy hunters can purchase licenses. Under the Mongolian Hunting Fee Law of 1995, revenue generated from argali trophy hunting is divided among the federal government’s general funds (70%), the local province (20%), and the hunting organization (10%); specifically, US$ 18,000 for <em>O. a. ammon</em> trophies and US$ 9,000 for <em>O. a. darwini</em> trophies is allocated to local and federal governments (Wingard and Odgerel 2002). Ostensibly this money should benefit local people, government agencies, and help implement important conservation actions for argali and the ecosystems they inhabit, but unfortunately, little of this money makes it back to local people or to the conservation of the species (Amgalanbaatar and Reading 2000, Amgalanbaatar <em>et al</em>. 2002a, Wingard and Zahler 2006, Reading and Amgalanbaatar 2016). Indeed, because local governments generally receive no additional revenue from trophy hunting (the federal government simply reduces payments to local governments that receive trophy hunting permits), many local governments are actively establishing protected areas to prevent future hunting (Amgalanbaatar <em>et al</em>. 2002a, Reading and Amgalanbaatar 2016). Recent reforms to Mongolian trophy hunting practices have led to proposals for community-based wildlife management programmes (Amgalanbaatar <em>et al</em>. 2002a, Reading and Amgalanbaatar 2016). Initial efforts by WWF-Mongolia, the Argali Wildlife Research Center, Denver Zoological Foundation, and local governments stalled; however, after initiation of a Global Environment Facility Project in the region and no progress has been made in recent years. <br/> <br/> WWF and the Ministry of Nature and Environment organised a workshop on ‘Conservation of Argali in Mongolia’ in 2000 that resulted in a Argali Conservation Management Plan in 2002. However, this plan has not yet been adopted by the government and is not being implemented.<br/> <br/> Mongolia’s Argali Wildlife Research Centre, Denver Zoological Foundation, and Mongolian Academy of Sciences cooperate on a number of conservation and research projects, including an interdisciplinary research and conservation project in Ikh Nart Nature Reserve, Dornogobi Aimag in cooperation with the Dalanjargal Soum Administration. That work, begun in the late 1990s, has resulted in several publications (e.g., Amgalanbaatar and Reading 2000, 2003; Reading <em>et al</em>. 2001, 2003, 2005, 2009; Amgalanbaatar <em>et al</em>. 2002a, 2002b, 2006, 2012; Tserenbataa <em>et al</em>. 2004; Wingard 2005; Singh <em>et al</em>. 2010; Wingard <em>et al</em>. 2011a, 2011b; Bragin <em>et al</em>. 2017; Murdoch <em>et al</em>. 2017a, 2017b; Rosenbaum <em>et al</em>. 2019), development of ecotourism to support conservation, a broad conservation education program, and active conservation management of the reserve by the Dalanjargal Soum Administration. <br/> <br/> Additional conservation measures are desperately required in Mongolia. Clark <em>et al</em>. (2006) outlined the following:<br/> <br/> • Implement the recommendations outlined in the Argali Conservation Management Plan, update the plan regularly and monitor its implementation, in particular in all hunting areas.<br/> • Improve enforcement of existing legislation that would help conserve argali. <br/> • Enhance conservation management in protected areas where argali are found at high population densities, and increase the capacity of protected areas personnel and other environmental law enforcement officers.<br/> • Work to improve the livelihoods of local communities in areas where argali are protected by local initiatives and re-initiate community-based approaches to argali conservation (Amgalanbaatar <em>et al</em>. 2002a).<br/> • Develop public education programmes to raise awareness of the status of and threats to the species. <br/> • Continue ecological research, monitor population trends, and study the impacts of threats, including work in the Altai and Khangai Mountains to complement research occurring in the Gobi Desert.<br/> • Implement the recommendations from the Mongolian Wildlife Trade Workshop as outlined in Wingard and Zahler (2006).<br/><br/> Major revisions to argali trophy hunting practices in Mongolia as outlined in Amgalanbaatar <em>et al</em>. (2002a) and Reading and Amgalanbaatar (2016) could generate substantial revenue for conservation and ensure that local people benefit, greatly benefitting argali conservation. However, the barriers to changing the way trophy hunting is managed and implemented in Mongolia are formidable.  <br/> Pakistan<br/> Working with local people in the Khunjerab area toward mutually agreeable conservation solutions has been a contentious issue for many years. Successful resolution of competing claims with concerns for the interests of argali will ultimately be beneficial for conservation.<br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Russia</strong><br/> Argali are listed in the Red Data Book of the Russian Federation, and hunting is legally banned; it is unclear how effective this legal protection is. Argali occur in the Altaisky Zapovednik, but most argali in the Russian Federation are outside of protected areas. Both Weinberg <em>et al</em>. (1997) and Paltsyn (2001) suggested expanding the area under protected area status in the area. Weinberg <em>et al</em>. (1997) suggested that the eastern portion of Sailguem Ridge near the Mongolian border could be a possible new protected area, as well as in the upper reaches of the Chagan-Burgazy River. Paltsyn (2001) noted that WWF has developed a long-term program to promote sustainable development in the Altai-Sayan region, which could have benefits for argali.<br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Tajikistan</strong><br/> Argali occur in Pamir National Park (26,000 km²), and the Zorkul Zapovednik (870 km²), although neither protected area is fully functional (Schaller and Kang 2008). Argali have generally benefited from the substantial reduction in domestic livestock grazing in the high-elevation Pamirs following Tajikistan’s independence in 1991 (Fedosenko 1999a). Trophy hunting began in 1987, the same year that local hunting was prohibited (Fedosenko 1999b). Argali are legally protected and quotas for trophy hunts are issued by the Government, numbering 40-80/year (Schaller and Kang 2008, Michel and Rosen, 2016). There are reports that additional animals are sometimes sold beyond the official quotas. However, poaching, by pastoralists, military, and border guards have been major threats – in part due to the civil war of the mid 1990s – and continue to be in less extent. Protection from excessive human mortality and human disturbance appears to be well controlled by hunting concessions in the southeastern corner, somewhat less so in other portions of argali range (Schaller 2003). Trophy hunts represent a substantial source of revenue that could be used for argali conservation; this appears to be occurring in some hunting concessions within Tajikistan, but not in others (Schaller 2003, Michel and Rosen 2016). Since 2013 a community-based group developed game management area in the northern part of Alichur Pamir; revenues from hunting, tourism and conservation grants were used to prevent poaching and reduce livestock competition, resulting in an increase of argali numbers in this area. <br/> <br/><u> </u><strong>Uzbekistan</strong><br/> Severtzov’s argali are protected with the Nuratau Strictly Protected Area and a few individuals possibly survive in the Zaamin Strictly Protected Area, which however due to its location in the border zone had been of limited effectiveness since the 1990s. The species is included in the Red Book of Uzbekistan and protected from general hunting, although limited trophy hunting is permitted and occurs irregularly with up to 5 permits per year. Unfortunately, little law enforcement to prevent poaching occurs outside of the protected areas. Support for anti-poaching and improvement of pasture use are crucial.",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

It inhabits steep and rocky terrain in evergreen and deciduous forests, especially with exposed grassy ridges from about 500–2,000 m asl. It eats a wide range of plant material: grass, herbs and shoots, leaves of small trees, nuts, and even some fruit. Group home range size is typically around 40 hectares, with males occupying marked territories of 22–25 hectares during the mating season. They typically live in small groups of 4–12 individuals, with older males usually solitary. Gorals are diurnal, and are most active in the early morning and late evening, but can be active throughout on overcast days. It keeps to steeper slopes where it is very agile over rocky crags and cliffs. The gestation length is 6.5 months (Patton <em>et al</em>. 2000). Males and females reach sexual maturity at approximately three years, with a lifespan of up to 15 years or so. Mating takes place in early winter, and one, or rarely two-three, kids are born about 6.5 months later.","In Russia and the Republic of Korea, major threats to its survival include habitat loss due to forestry, agriculture, and poaching. In addition, the fragmentation of habitat due to development and roads is a major threat. Threats from heavy snow in Mt. Sorak, Samcheok city and Ulgin county are also observed (Cho <em>et al. </em>2015). Threats in China include shooting, snaring, habitat degradation, and competition from domestic livestock (Smith and Xie 2008). Poaching is both for traditional medicine and meat. In Russia, an increased number of small boats owned by people apparently have led to increased poaching pressure in seashore goral habitats.","In 2017, the total number of goral in Russia was estimated at 700–1,100 animals (Zaumyslova <em>et al.</em> 2017), with insignificant decline. Myslenkov and Voloshina (1989) indicated no decline in numbers or disappearance of any known local population, and that numbers along the Sea of Japan may have been slowly increasing. Lazo District has about 190-230 animals, Terneisky District around 200–250, Olginsky District 75–105, and Dalnegorsky District 95–25, Kavalerovski District 2–3, Partizanski District 13–23, Anuchinski District 38–60, Chuguevski District 14–22, Shkotovski District 5–7, Khasanski District 2–3 goral. <br/><br/>In the Republic of Korea, fewer than 50 animals were estimated to remain on Konbong mountain in Konsong-gun, Kangwon Province, near the demilitarized zone (DMZ) (Won 1988). Through active restoration efforts, it has been reported that there are about 1,000 individuals at the present time (Cho 2013).<br/><br/>There are no estimates available for DPR Korea. Won (1997) estimated less than 50 animals, but the basis for this estimate was unclear. <br/><br/>There are no reliable population estimates for Long-tailed Goral in China. Smith and Xie (2008) considered it to be strongly reduced in numbers.",Decreasing,"<p>Long-tailed Goral are found in eastern Russia (Primorsky Territory), northeastern China, the Republic of Korea (Grubb, 2005). It is possible that a population of Long-tailed Gorals the Democratic People’s Republic (DPR) of Korea has been extirpated. In Russia, Long-tailed Goral were previously distributed along almost the entire southern half of Sikhote-Alin range, (i.e. the entire Primorsky Territory and southern part of Khabarovsk Territory) and in Jewish Autonomus region. Currently, about 80% of Russian population is located alone the sea shore between Belkin cape (45.820278, 137.690833) and Ostrovnoy cape (42.810483, 133.719248) i.e. Sikhote-Alin range still harbours the population while Khabarovsk Territory and Jewish Autonomus region do not. Northeastern border of Long-tailed Goral range is located in Krasnoarmeyski district of Primorsky Territory, at the upstream of Kolumbe River where a goral was shot in year of 1997. &#160;Southwest border of Long-tailed Goral range in Primorsky Territory is located in Ussuri Nature Reserve. Since goral are confined to specific habitat—steep rocky slopes covered with sparse, montane broad-leaved forest, from sea level to about 1,000 m (Heptner <em>et al</em>., 1961), and cliffs and forests are necessary for goral habitats, there are just a few inland places with stable populations: landmark ‘Stone Gate’ in Dalnegorsk district, upstream of Milogradovka River in Olga district, watershed of Izvilinka River, Chuguevski district, and Prozrachnaya River, Anuchino district (Zaumyslova and Bondarchuk 2017).<br/><br/>In China the Long-tailed Goral is found in the northeast, and stretches along the Xiao Hinggan Ling mountains (Lesser Khingan range), along the lower reaches of Sungari and Amur Rivers in eastern Jilin and Heilong Jiang, and eastern Liaoning, and includes the Changbaishan range (Jilin) on the border with DPR Korea (Wang 2003, Smith and Xie 2008).<br/><br/>In DPR Korea, little is known of the recent distribution of this species (Shackleton, 1997). It is likely that it occurs (or rather it occurred) in the Hamgyong mountains which lie inland from the northeastern coastline, and in the Taebaek mountains in the southwest. Since the DMZ is restricted by a 243 km fence, the habitat is not connected to Republic of Korea. A third area where it may occur is the Nanghim mountains in the north-central part of DPR Korea. These are extensions of the Changhai mountains from Jilin (China).<br/><br/>In the Republic of Korea, from east sea coast of the city of Goseong-gun, Gangwon province, to the east of the city of Pocheon, Gyeonggi province.

The elevation and range where Red Goral&#160;is found supports one of the largest tracts of primary coniferous woodland in Asia, which along with its rocky outcrops, form the species' primary habitat (Zhang 1987, Wang 1998, Sheng <em>et al</em><em>.&#160;</em>1999). Most areas in its range receive abundant rainfall (2000 mm annually) most of which falls in the summer months of April to August (Zhang 1987). Red Gorals migrate seasonally, moving in the winter (typically, November through to March) to lower-elevation mixed deciduous and coniferous forests or glades and thickets below the snow line (Zhang 1987, Wang, 1998, Sheng <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1999, Rabinowitz 1999). Locals report that Red Gorals&#160;are most frequently observed at lower elevations during winter, returning to higher altitudes in April (Rabinowitz 1999). Red Gorals are diurnal, and are most active in the early morning and late evening, but can be active throughout on overcast days (Sheng <em>et al</em><em>.&#160;</em>1999). They graze on sunny slopes, retreating to steep rocky cliffs and sheltered ledges at night (Zhang 1987).</p>  <p>Red Goral is typically solitary, but small groups of 2-3, typically a female and her offspring, sometimes accompanied with a male, or an offspring from the previous two years, are not uncommon (Zhang 1987, Sheng <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1999, Nijhawan 2020 unpub. data). Group home range size is around 40 hectares, but males occupy marked territories of 22-25 hectares during the mating season (Duckworth and MacKinnon 2008). Although there are no long-term studies on Red Goral’s diet selection, Zhang (1987) and Sheng <em>et al</em><em>.</em> (1999) note that the diet consists primarily of lichens, but it also feeds on grasses, weeds, tender stems, leaves, and twigs from shrubs. Both males and females reach sexual maturity at approximately three years, with a lifespan of up to 15 years (Duckworth and MacKinnon 2008). Mating occurs in December, and single young are born in June after a six-month (170-218 days) gestation period (Duckworth and MacKinnon 2008, Smith and Xie 2008).</p>  <p>Captive females have been observed to reach sexual maturity at 1.5 years of age, giving birth at two, while males start to demonstrate rutting behaviour at three years. The estrus cycle last 17-23 days and 10-20 copulation attempts may occur during the female’s receptive period of anywhere between 6 to 72 hours (Zhang <em>et al.</em> 1993 in Xie 2006). </p>","<p>Illegal hunting and habitat loss caused by infrastructure development and expansion of monoculture forestry are major threats throughout the species’ range (Duckworth and MacKinnon 2008). Since the opening up of and the economic reforms in Tibet, large-scale hunting has had a major negative impact on the population of Red Goral. This is due primarily to the increasing number of immigrants and modern weapons (Duckworth and MacKinnon 2008). Although hunting bans have been enforced from time to time in some areas, poaching is still common especially when animals move down to their winter ranges (Zhang 1991). </p>  <p>Unsustainable illegal hunting is the major threat to the species in Myanmar too (Than Zaw pers. comm. 2020), where Rabinowitz (1999) reports that it is one of the most heavily hunted ungulates in its range. The meat is consumed locally, and the skins are sold to traders. Horns are valued medicinally in China (Than Zaw pers. comm. 2020). During Rabinowitz’s expedition to the mountains north of Putao in 1997, the village of Gawai claimed kills of up to 50 red gorals a year, while Tahawndam village estimated an annual offtake of 20–30 Red Gorals. Despite the hunting pressure, Rabinowitz and Khaing (1998) reported that Red Goral&#160;was one of the most common large mammals in the region at that time. </p>  In Arunachal too, unsustainable illegal hunting, particularly for commercial sale, is a significant threat. Many hunters both in Northern Myanmar and Arunachal Pradesh (India) claim to depend on the meat of Red Goral&#160;for their long hunting journeys for musk deer. Sale of musk deer pods is not only an important source of livelihood for the rural poor of this region; it also holds immense cultural value for most local communities (Nijhawan 2018). In Dibang Valley, Red Goral&#160;is a frequent bycatch in the traps set for musk deer (Nijhawan unpublished data).","Red Goral remains poorly studied throughout its range and recent population estimates are generally unavailable. The species appears to occur at low densities throughout its range. In a camera trap study conducted over 450 km² in Dibang Valley of Arunachal Pradesh, India, Nijhawan (2018) encountered 51 independent photographic detections of Red Goral&#160;over 7,631 trap nights. The Red Goral&#160;is easily sighted in some parts of Dibang Valley, often in pairs on steep rocky outcrops in the temperate zone above 2,000 meters, (Nijhawan 2020, unpub. data). Eastern Arunachal Pradesh is likely to contain a significant population of the species particularly in the Siang, Dibang and Lohit river basins and upstream areas of the Noa-Dihing river in Changlang district.<br/><br/>Sporadic camera trapping conducted by the Myanmar Forest Department and WCS in Hponkanrazi and Hkakaborazi areas in 2003-05 and 2015-16 recorded a total of 17 independent detection of Red Goral&#160;(Forest Department and WCS Myanmar, unpub. data). Rabinowitz and Khaing (1998) reported that despite hunting pressure, Red Goral&#160;was common to abundant in the mountains surrounding Hkakaborazi Protected Area, north of Nam Tamai River, although more recently, Than Zaw and W. Duckworth (pers. comm. 2006) suggested that the species is rare in Myanmar because of its naturally restricted range, compounded by the effects of trade-driven hunting.<br/><br/>In random sampling conducted in Tibet (Xizang), China during the summer of 1987-88, Zhang (1991) estimated between 810 and 1,370 individuals in the area, distributed as follows: 120 to 180 for Nyingchi, 60 to 220 for Bome, 320 to 380 for Zayu, 220 to 450 Medog, and 90 to 140 for Mainling. Wang (1998) suggested that total numbers in China were less than 1,500.<br/><br/>While it is difficult to accurately estimate the global population size of Red Goral&#160;given the paucity of systematic data, the total population size is probably under 8,000-10,000 mature individuals.<br/><br/>Field reports confirm that the species continues to face threats from hunting and habitat destruction from infrastructure development. For example, in Arunachal Pradesh’s Dibang Valley, the species has nearly disappeared from a few locations because of road construction and an associated spike in illegal hunting. However, given that this species occurs in very challenging and inaccessible terrain, which has given it natural protection from overexploitation, the estimated decline is likely to be around 10%.",Decreasing,"<p><em>Naemorhedus baileyi</em> has the most restricted range of all goral species being confined to the temperate mountains of northern Myanmar, China (southeast Tibet and Yunnan), and Northeast India (Arunachal Pradesh, near the Chinese and Burmese borders) (Grubb 2005, Singh 2002). It is found at higher elevations than most gorals, between altitudes of 2,000-4,500 m (Zhang 1987, Rabinowitz 1999, Smith and Xie 2008). Recent studies have found <em>N. baileyi</em> to be the only goral species in its range, contrary to previous accounts of range overlap with other goral species (Hayman 1961, Rabinowtiz and Khaing 1998, Nijhawan <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>In India’s Arunachal Pradesh, Red Goral&#160;presence has been confirmed from eastern part of the state including the districts of Upper Siang (Karthik Teegalapalli pers. comm. 2020), Dibang Valley (Nijhawan 2018), Lower Dibang Valley, Anjaw, Lohit (Nijhawan unpublished data 2019) and Changlang (Namdapha Tiger Reserve and the community forests beyond Vijaynagar bordering Myanmar). In Changlang, the species, locally known as Si, is commonly seen according to the local Lisu community. Recently conducted interviews with local hunters indicated that the species is also likely to be present in the higher catchment of Rivers Kameng. Kurung, Kumey and Subansiri (Nijhawan unpublished data 2020) in Arunachal Pradesh. However, these reports need confirmation through rigorous first-hand surveys.&#160; <br/><br/>In Myanmar, Red Goral&#160;has been confirmed only from the northern mountains of Kachin state in Putao district from Hponkanrazi Wildlife Sanctuary and Hkakaborazi National Park (Rabinowtiz and Khaing 1998, Rabinowtiz 1999, Forest Department and WCS Myanmar pers. comm. 2020). Within Hkakaborazi, <em>N. baileyi </em>was the only goral reported present, whereas south of Nam Tamai, where <em>N. caudatus </em>was reported, the Red Goral&#160;was absent (Rabinowtiz and Khaing 1998).<br/><br/>China contains the largest distribution (in terms of area) of the species with populations confirmed from two provinces: Tibet Autonomous Region (Xizang) and Yunnan. Nyingchi City prefecture of Tibet is reported as the primary distribution area of Red Goral with confirmed records from, but not limited to, the area around Nyingchi City, Motuo Nature Reserve, Linzhi Dongjiu Red Goral Nature Reserve, and Yarlung Zangbo Grand Canyon National Nature Reserve (Forestry Investigation and Planning Institute of the Tibet Autonomous Region 2017; Zhang Di pers. comm. 2020). According to summer surveys carried out in this region in 1987-88, the distribution area is between about 27° to 29°30'N and 96° to 98°E confined to the counties of Bome, Mainling, Bayi, Zayu, Nangxiang and Medog around the junction of the Pelung Zangbo and Yarlung Zangbo rivers (Feng <em>et al</em><em>. </em>1986; Zhang 1987, 1991; Rabinowitz 1999; Wang Sung <em>et al.</em> 1997). Recent accounts suggest that the species’ stronghold is to the south of the Sichuan-Tibet highway. In Yunnan, Red Goral&#160;is known to occur in Nùjiāng Lisu Autonomous Prefecture in Gongshan Derung and Nu Autonomous county where it was reported from Gaoligongshan National Nature Reserve in the 1980s, but information is lacking on its current status in the area (Wang 2003; Zhang Di pers. comm. 2020). Its presence has also been confirmed in Baima Snow Mountain National Nature Reserve in Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. All occurrences in Yunnan are limited to the west of Salween (Nujiang) River (Zhang Di pers. comm. 2020) The species’ range does not extend into Sichuan Province as previously believed. </p>",,Terrestrial,"The Red Goral&#160;is listed on Appendix I of CITES. It is protected as a Class I Protected Species in China. It received complete legal protection in 1987 (Zhang 1991). Populations are currently known from at least five protected areas in Tibet and Yunnan. A small herd has been breeding successfully in Shanghai Zoo. Duckworth and MacKinnon (2008) proposed the following conservation measures for Red Goral&#160;populations in China: 1) Enforce the existing protection laws for this species. 2) Establish two proposed protected areas that have not yet been acted on by the government of Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR): &#160;a) an area of 200 km diameter, with its centre at “big turning point of Yarlung Zangbo Jiang” (Zhang 1987); and b) an “International Mountain Research Centre” in Yegon county with eight nature reserves in the area surrounding Nanjabarva Peak (Mountaineering and Scientific Expedition, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 1985). These reserves would contain the core range of Red Goral, an area that is relatively pristine and has a widespread mountain ecosystem that supports high levels of biodiversity (Duckworth and MacKinnon 2008). <br/> In India, the Red Goral&#160;is legally protected under Schedule I (revised March 1987) of the Wildlife Protection Act (1972). While it is still hunted illegally, its hunting is naturally restricted owing to the inaccessibility of the terrain in which it exists. <br/><br/>This species is largely within protected areas in Myanmar, notably the Hponkanrazi Wildlife Sanctuary and the Hkakaborazi National Park (Duckworth and MacKinnon 2008).",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Based, particularly on camera-trapping results, Large-antlered Muntjac in most of its presumed range has a local population status more similar to the likes of Tiger (<em>Panthera tigris</em>), Saola (<em>Pseudoryx nghetinhensis</em>)<em> </em>and Gaur (<em>Bos gaurus</em>), all species that are unquestionably Critically Endangered (declines of 90% or more in the last 20–30 years) within the range of Large-antlered Muntjac, than to species such as Northern Red Muntjac, even though the latter is congeneric.<br/><br/>Although the paucity of solid survey data hinders the use of range reduction in red listing this species, such contraction is likely to be a contributory factor particularly over the next three generations when ongoing hunting and habitat trends will exterminate many of the small and isolated populations presumed still persisting. In 2015, although there are still essentially no hard data, such extirpations have almost certainly started to occur (e.g., in Xe Bang-Nouan National Protected Area (NPA), Lao PDR). The extreme paucity of recent (post-2000) records from most of this muntjac’s known range indicate that the species is now at very low densities, with a presumably numerically small but incalculable population in the majority of its former range. Surveys since 2008 bring even greater support to this statement, as well as more strongly suggesting that these low densities are hunting induced. The species may never have been as abundant in its range as Northern Red Muntjac overall, even though locally they are sometimes similar in abundance. But such a difference cannot be assumed, it may simply be that by the time of its scientific discovery, Large-antlered Muntjac was already greatly reduced across most its range, in the same way that sympatric Tiger, wild cattle, Asian Elephant (<em>Elephas maximus</em>)<em> </em>and even Sambar (<em>Rusa unicolor</em>)<em> </em>were by the early 1990s in Lao PDR and Viet Nam. However, assuming that pre-exploitation densities were in general somewhat lower than those of Northern Red Muntjac, the very low densities indicated for the 2008 assessment at least a 50% reduction in about 21 years (generation length is seven years for this species) in all of past, present and future. In 2015, these rates of decline now seem overly very optimistic, especially in light of the current situation in Nakai - Nam Theun NPA, see below). In 2008 data did not exist to allow empirical determination of actual decline rate, but its magnitude was based on: such a level of reduction in population would be barely detectable by survey styles to date, the species’ rarity seems both unnatural and recent, reflecting the massive scale of trade-driven snaring and the ubiquity of ‘subsistence’-level snaring, the ubiquity of non-targeted hunting methods which will wipe out even relict populations of individual species provided at least one other desirable species caught by the same means remain in numbers sufficient for hunting to be viable, the apparent association of the species with lower and mid altitude forests, probably particularly with broken canopy, and thus the overlap of populations with the highest hunting levels for wild meat, and the lack of secure source populations in large rugged forest-clothed massifs, the presence of a large hydropower project (Nam Theun 2, in central Lao PDR) within the healthiest known population, which flooded some prime habitat and, unintentionally, greatly facilitated trade-driven hunting throughout that population, and the inability of the last 15 years of stepped-up conservation activities in the region to make any serious inroads on hunting and trading of ungulates. Information since 2008 suggests that the decline rate was probably both higher than estimated and has if anything increased, despite positive developments in limited situations, in general the intensity of threats has greatly increased since 2008, yet the conservation response overall has failed to follow to a concomitant level. In particular the Nam Theun 2 hydropower project has probably had much greater negative impact than even the most realistic pre-impoundment scenarios predicted. In addition, the opening of access in the heart of the species’ range through recent construction of the Ho Chi Minh Highway through the Annamite Mountains in Viet Nam (with feeder roads into Lao PDR) has greatly increased hunting pressure.<br/><br/>In particular, the up-listing to Critically Endangered reflects further data from Viet Nam, suggesting that the species survives nowhere commonly, and in all well-surveyed areas is now extremely rare or extirpated. In contrast, the regularity with which trophy frontlets were found in the 1990s indicated that it was then still widespread. Furthermore, hunting pressure and forest clearance in southern Viet Nam, where there was a hope in 2008 that significant populations might persist, has increased substantially since the beginning of the century. Recent data from Lao PDR also suggests a bleaker picture than was hoped, with only one new area found where the species could be considered reasonably common, whilst in several other areas there has been confirmation of the species's rarity. Current trends on the Nakai Plateau and in other areas of Nakai-Nam Theun NPA suggest very significant declines are already underway. In the only other area where there is an indication of a significant population, Laving Laveun Provincial Protected Area, current factors suggest it is only a matter of time before seemingly inevitable declines begin. Whilst the Nakai-Nam Theun population and presumed similar populations in other remote sites tempered the 2008 listing by constituting large populations with presumed only moderate decline, and with a hope that law enforcement activities might significantly reduce hunting intensity, this can no longer be assumed. The global population has in the past 15-25 years has almost certainly exceeded a decline rate of over 90% and will surely do so in the future if current trends continue.<br/>&#160;<br/>The recommendations in 2008 that “it is vital that the surveys proposed in southern Viet Nam are undertaken and that the Nakai Plateau and Nakai–Nam Theun population be monitored closely in coming years, and that, based on these sources of information, the red list categorisation be reviewed regularly” (Timmins <em>et al.</em> 2008a) still hold true in 2016, it is unfortunate however that so little has been achieved in the intervening years.","The habitat preferences of the Large-antlered Muntjac remain unclear. Its global distribution is somewhat similar to better-understood species such as Crested Argus <em>Rheinardia ocellata</em> and Red-shanked Douc <em>Pygathrix nemaeus</em>, suggesting that it is tied to the evergreen and semi-evergreen forests characteristic of the Annamites, and cannot use the climatically drier hill semi-evergreen forests further north and west. But paradoxically, it is not now common in the ‘ever-wet’ eastern slopes of the Northern and Central Annamite ranges. Perhaps, as is strongly suspected with both Crested Argus and Red-shanked Douc, substantial population losses have resulted from very high hunting pressure in such regions. While such a proposition is consistent with the apparent decline at Vu Quang Nature Reserve during the 1990s as discussed in Eve <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2001: 45 and 122, see above, under Population), there is no real evidence for it, although information from villagers in Viet Nam does suggest such a pattern (B. Long pers. comm. 2008). An intrinsic sub-optimality of closed-canopy ever-wet forest cannot yet be ruled out. Both the areas for which there is reasonable evidence for relatively high abundance, the Nakai Plateau and adjacent areas of Nakai–Nam Theun NPA, and the Lam Dong Province, are both a rather heterogeneous mosaic of habitats, with extensive areas not supporting closed-canopy forest (based on historical rather than recent disturbance). Although there are a significant number of records from the Nakai Plateau in essentially mosaic habitat, many of the camera-trapped individuals in Nakai–Nam Theun NPA were within large closed canopy Semi-evergreen Forest blocks (Coudrat <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014a, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2015 based on a review of WMPA camera-trapping unpublished data). Although much of the Annamites in Lao PDR and Viet Nam could also be described as “a rather heterogeneous mosaic of habitats”, there are not many such extensive landscapes without high densities of human population and heavy fragmentation (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Habitat in Vu Quang NR is more contiguous and primarily evergreen forest, climatically wetter than the above two areas, but at lower altitudes much of the forest is somewhat opened-up (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). The areas of Laving Laveun PPA where the species was camera-trapped was essentially unbroken closed canopy forest, best considered Semi-evergreen forest at the mesic end of its spectrum, somewhat transitional with Wet Evergreen Forest, within relatively steep terrain (Duckworth <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010, Timmins 2013b). Muntjac remains in villages and camera-trapping in both Lao PDR and Viet Nam suggest a lack of syntopy between the Large-antlered Muntjac and the Roosevelts' group, even though there is a wide sympatry (W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. 2008, B. Long pers. comm. 2008, R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>The Large-antlered Muntjac’s altitudinal range remains somewhat uncertain: hunting areas around most villages from which specimens come span a wide range. Interviews of villagers throughout Quang Nam, Hue and Quang Tri provinces, Viet Nam, all suggested that this muntjac does not live much above 900 m asl (B. Long pers. comm. 2008), however the ability of villagers to identify muntjacs to species appears to be variable but in general poor (Timmins <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1998, Dersu 2008, Timmins 2013a, Timmins in press b). Altitudinal and other location specific information derived from remains of animals seen in villages needs evidence of its reliability: specifically, hunters’ statements of origins of skulls, no matter how certain-sounding, need to be taken carefully, often, hunters assertively associate skulls and lower jaws as from one animal when tooth-wear patterns show that they must have come from different individuals (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008), and attempts at corroborating the details of specific hunting incidents of Saola (a rare species) by carrying out repeat interviews has often shown conflicting statements and changes in ‘facts’ between the interviews (Timmins 2013b, Duckworth <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010: pp. 72-74, Timmins in press b).<br/><br/>The majority of camera-trapped individuals in Nakai-Nam Theun NPA have been below 1000 m with the highest-altitude detection thought to be around 1200 m, despite camera-trapping to much higher elevations (Coudrat <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014b, WMPA unpublished data). Records from Laving Laveun PPA came from 550-800 m (21 of 23 cameras being set between 500-800 m, Duckworth <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010). The records from Khe Nuoc Trong PNR came from below 200 m (Le Trong Trai pers. comm. 2015). In the southern Annamites the single record from Chu Yang Sin NP came from 900 m (BirdLife International 2010). The Dak Nong – Mondulkiri Plateau largely lies below 1000 m (Timmins in press a). Lam Ha District, Lam Dong lies predominantly between 900-1200 m with higher elevations in other districts of Lam Dong Province. The elevations of the camera-trap records from Bolikhamxay Province in the 1990s are not precisely known, but were likely to have been below 1000 m (based on reported locations and the terrain visible in the pictures, Robichaud and Stuart 1999, R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2015). Camera-trapping at elevations above 1500 m at sites where mammal populations appear not to have been severely impacted by hunting includes both Nakai-Nam Theun NPA and Xe Sap NPA, suggesting that the lack of records from such elevations are a genuine reflection of ecological habitat preferences (Coudrat <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014b, WMPA unpublished data, WWF Greater Mekong unpublished data, R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2015). The lower elevation limits of the species are much more poorly understood, particularly as recent presence (or lack thereof) at lower elevations is probably strongly affected by hunting, in Nakai-Nam Theun the species was evidently common down to c. 500 m, the lowest elevation that extensive camera-trapping was undertaken (Coudrat <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014b, Dersu 2008, WMPA unpublished data). Relatively few areas below 500 m in Lao PDR and almost none surveyed by camera-trapping are likely to be ecologically suitable, as the gradient in climate moving west away from the Annamite spine is in most areas likely to be far steeper than the equivalent gradient in elevation away from the Annamite spine. In Viet Nam there are so few records with known point localities that the lower altitudinal limits of the species are hard to even speculate, which in combination with the facts that almost all Annamite forest areas below c. 500 m probably experience(d) very intensive hunting pressure and there are very few areas left below this altitude large enough to hold viable populations makes it unlikely that the lower elevation limits will be determined. Many Annamite species show significant differences in lower altitudinal ‘limits’ between the eastern and western slopes (often much lower in the east), and the same could well be true for Large-antlered Muntjac (Timmins <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1999, R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2016). Taken together the data available suggest that the species mostly occurred below about 1,000 m asl (as previously speculated e.g. Timmins <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1998, Evans <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2000), but localised higher occurrence in undulating plateaux, for example in the Southern Annamites of Cambodia and Viet Nam, would not be surprising (e.g. Bauer 1997). <br/><br/>The lack of precisely located field records also hinders assessment of use of secondary habitats. As an ungulate dependent upon ground-level food (including fallen fruit, presumably, when available), densities would be expected to be higher in edge, broken and secondary areas than in closed-canopy tall evergreen forest.","Threats as identified by the 2008 assessment by and large still remain true in 2015. The 2008 assessment of threats is reiterated below along with updates and qualifications based on new information since that time.<br/><br/>As of 2008, suitable habitat for the Large-antlered Muntjac is still extensive (under the reasonable assumption that it uses secondary forest), but, especially within Viet Nam, it seems absent from many accessible, but superficially, at least, suitable habitat blocks. In the intervening period there has been an acceleration in the rate of habitat loss at low to mid elevations, especially in the Southern Annamites, as clearly indicated by comparison of satellite images from different periods over the last few decades. This strongly indicates that over-hunting is its primary threat. Heavy deployment of camera-traps in several interior forests of Viet Nam produced few photographs, showing that Large-antlered Muntjac can be rare even in the most remote areas. A decline would suggest great susceptibility to hunting, but it is possible that it was never common in the types of interior closed-canopy forest surveyed and is restricted to specific types (not yet camera-trapped) or may even be strongly associated with edges. If the latter, then a high proportion of the population would be facing very heavy hunting pressure as well as an accelerating threat of habitat loss due to clear-felling for plantation forestry, because of proximity to settlement of much of the suitable habitat. Whatever the explanation for the rarity of records in most camera-trapping areas, it suggests a much stronger level of threat than has hitherto been appreciated (e.g. by Timmins <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1998, Duckworth <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1999, the listing as only Provisionally At Risk in Lao PDR in the latter is now clearly inappropriately optimistic). While the socio-economic factors outlined in this section bear on the conservation status of all ungulates and primates, of most carnivores, and of many other mammals in Lao PDR and Viet Nam, Large-antlered Muntjac is probably one of two species (the other being Saola <em>Pseudoryx nghetinhensis</em>) which is most at global risk through them. This is because it is big enough to be a main wildlife meat source, it does not have populations secured in other countries such as India, Nepal and Thailand, with installed effective management in at least some protected areas, it does not have populations in the rugged mountain forest blocks where trade-driven hunting of species valued only for their meat (rather than high-value, low-weight, generally medicinal products that can be carried out efficiently from even the remotest areas) is limited by economics of accessibility, and it does not occur on the plains where (for a mix of essentially non-biological reasons) protected area management is being most successful in conserving ungulates (e.g. Cambodia).<br/><br/>Large-antlered Muntjacs are hunted within a thriving hunting and wildlife trading culture which abounds in all range states and in adjacent countries such as China and Thailand, involving many land vertebrate species, along with other forest products such as orchids and <em>Aquilaria </em>resin (e.g. Compton and Le Hai Quang 1998, Compton <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1999, Noreen and Claridge 2001). Hunters do not target Large-antlered Muntjacs, but are seeking any and all species with marketable meat and products for the medicinal markets. Such hunting reaches all this muntjac’s range, and with so many species and products, non-selective methods continue at high levels until the most resilient species is no longer common enough for hunting to be commercially viable. This non-specificity makes regional hunting practices a peculiarly strong driver of localised and, in aggregate, regional, extinctions (e.g. Tungittiplakorn and Dearden 2002). The regional wild meat trade has little likelihood of abating as long as there are any pigs, muntjacs, and civets to be hunted or there becomes a serious commitment on the behalf of range-state governments to address the issue. Large-antlered Muntjacs will be extinct long before these more resilient species become so rare that communities are driven to ‘fishing down’ for smaller species using methods that do not threaten Large-antlered Muntjacs. In 2015, the human population of Viet Nam exceeds 93 million, that of China 1 billion. Together, they comprise an enormous market for wildlife products. For example, tens of millions of wild turtles are imported, legally and illegally, into China annually (van Dijk <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2000 and papers therein). There has been no comparable study of ungulate trade levels.<br/><br/>Hunting in Large-antlered Muntjacs's range is therefore very high: in the Northern and Central Annamites of Viet Nam, in a range shared with Saola, an estimated eight million people, almost all with the propensity to eat wildlife and mostly with direct links to the urban wildlife trade, live within 100 km of forest inhabited by Saola, and probably nowhere in the range of Large-antlered Muntjac is further than 30 km from a village (Timmins <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Within the Northern and Central Annamites, every square kilometre of Vietnamese forest and of Lao forest that is within 5 km of the Vietnamese border probably has snares capable of capturing Large-antlered Muntjac set in it every year (Timmins <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Very localised law enforcement efforts especially in the Hue and Quang Nam Saola Nature Reserves since 2011/2012, has probably to some extent mitigated this, and some small pockets of high-elevation terrain and the remotest of areas (e.g. limestone terrain) probably escape such high pressure, but countering this, snaring intensity in Lao areas in particular has certainly increased. Intensity in some areas probably reaches many thousands of snare-nights per km² per year (Timmins <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007). Snaring is less intensive in Lao PDR at least away from the Vietnamese border, but the intensity and spatial scale of snaring is increasing dramatically (Timmins 2013a, Duckworth <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010, Timmins in press a, b, Coudrat <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014 a, b). Hunting intensity has in recent decades been generally lower in southern Viet Nam than in Lao PDR and the northern and central Annamites of Viet Nam, leaving many wildlife populations less depleted (e.g. Le Xuan Canh <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1997, Timmins and Duckworth 2000, Polet and Ling 2004), but the general increase in regional hunting intensity and economic wealth indicate that hunting intensity in this region must also be increasing. In 2014 this appears now to be almost certainly the case over large areas of the Southern Annamites, even though sites such as Cat Tien NP retain anomalously healthy large mammal populations in a Vietnamese context, in many areas in fact hunting intensity of ground dwelling mammals may be approaching the levels of the Northern and Central Annamites (Timmins in press a, R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014), furthermore habitat loss in the Southern Annamites appears to be accelerating with substantial loss of mid-elevation forest already having occurred for instance on the Dak Nong – Mondulkiri Plateau (Timmins in press a, R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2015 based on a review of satellite images).<br/><br/>Closed tropical evergreen forests have inherently low ungulate biomass (Robinson and Bennett 2000), and beyond this populations of all wild animals larger than 20 kg in most of Large-antlered Muntjac’s range have been significantly reduced by human exploitation (Timmins and Ou 2001, Timmins <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008), the paucity of records across its range shows that this includes Large-antlered Muntjac itself. Field survey encounter rates even with Northern Red Muntjacs and pigs in much of Large-antlered Muntjac's range are remarkably low compared with other areas in Asia (Timmins and Ou 2001, Timmins <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008), wild cattle, Asian Elephant, and Tiger are all nearing extinction in this muntjac’s range (e.g. Duckworth and Hedges 1998), and in some of the worst-hit protected areas even the generally robust Northern Red Muntjac and wild pig are ecologically extinct (e.g. the western lowlands of Xe Bang-Nouan NPA, Lao PDR, J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008, based on 2007 field visit). Further surveys since 2008 have only reinforced this picture of dwindling wildlife populations and probable local extirpation of the most vulnerable species in ever more fragmented landscapes (Timmins in press a, b, Timmins 2013a, Suford 2010, Duckworth <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010, Timmins 2009. In the Nakai Plateau and Nakai-Nam Theun NPA, in some sectors the Large-antlered Muntjac and Northern Red Muntjac are similar in abundance. Comparison with other areas, where the former is much scarcer than the latter, implies that the Large-antlered is much more sensitive to hunting than is the Northern Red Similar results from Laving Laveun PPA further reinforce the probability that hunting above all else is the primary factor behind scarcity of the species in most Annamite forests at mid elevations (R.J Timmins pers. comm 2015). It may be intentionally targeted more (although there is no evidence for this, and it seems unlikely), or some facet of population biology such as fecundity (possible given its slightly larger size) may make it less resilient, or it may be associated with habitats that (for other reasons) are targeted by hunters. This latter factor is certainly true at the landscape scale: Large-antlered Muntjac primarily uses lower altitudes, yet forest blocks remote enough for hunting levels to be restrained by the economics of access and removal of meat are primarily mountainous areas of high altitude forest. If Large-antlered Muntjac is an edge species, densities in large un-encroached closed forest blocks would be low anyway. The lower-altitude disturbed forests may be the most suitable habitat for this muntjac, but because they are closer to high human population densities than are montane or little-encroached blocks, they support higher levels of generalised snaring and hunting. In comparison, Northern Red Muntjac has large populations in such high-altitude remote forest blocks, which may act as a repopulation reservoir for lower altitude areas. It is difficult to think of any habitat that could be a source for Large-antlered Muntjac. Since 2008 there have been no new observations to suggest that the above speculation is not broadly accurate, whilst new camera-trapping data solidifies the assumption that the species is primarily associated with forests below c. 1,000 m.<br/><br/>While demand for wild meat is the major driver of muntjac trade, parts such as antlers may be used for medicinal purposes. There is also the curio/status symbol appeal of trophy antlers: some are even on display in Bangkok (A.J. Lynam pers. comm. 2000). Since 2008 there appears to have been an upsurge in the trade in trophy antlers (of all species), to the extent that it is now often difficult to find Large-antlered Muntjac trophies within villages, the trade appears to favour trophies with large antlers (Timmins 2013a, R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014), one can only speculate that this will inevitably increase pressure on the species.<br/><br/>The effects of hunting in Lao PDR and Viet Nam have been exacerbated during the last two decades by habitat loss and various socio-economic factors, of which the most biologically significant seem to be:<br/><br/>Economic development and expanding wealth in the region are increasing the demand for wildlife meat and ‘medicines’ (Timmins <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007). Sage and Nguyen Cu (2001) and Timmins <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2007) highlighted a common misconception, especially in documentation of development projects in the region, that poverty is a principal cause of biodiversity loss, but as they pointed out for Saola, the main driver of threats for Saola, Large-antlered Muntjac and many other species, at least for the mid-term, is not rural poverty but increasing urban wealth in Indochina and China. In Viet Nam “the free market economy has resulted in feverish periods of trade in wild species nationwide, with negative impacts on biodiversity” (Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam 2004). In Cambodia, the same factor has fostered a thriving bushmeat market and hunting of species for international wildlife trade (Timmins and Ou 2001, Maxwell <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2006, Timmins 2006). There is a rapid, ongoing, expansion of wealthy social strata in Lao PDR, directly accelerated by illegal trade in rosewood, wild meat, and other forest resources, and by the economics of large infrastructure projects (e.g. Nan Theun 2 hydro-electric power project), creating a significantly greater in-country demand for luxury meats such as venison (W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. 2007). Markets along major roads such as route 13 (e.g. at Ban Namthon) have expanded, not contracted, in the last 15 years and have a huge (albeit unquantified) turnover of wild meat, at this specific market, multiple stalls are selling dried muntjac meat daily (balance of muntjac species unknown). If anything, trade has grown since 2008, and become more sophisticated, this appears particularly so in Lao PDR, as its border with Viet Nam has become increasingly opened up by new roads and upgrading of old border crossings (R.J. Timmins pers. comm 2015).<br/><br/>Road development in Viet Nam, especially the recent construction through the Annamite Mountains in Viet Nam of the Ho Chi Minh Highway, parallel to the Lao border, with its many feeder roads to Lao PDR and Cambodia that boost connectivity of rural areas to regional wildlife trade markets, is a severe and probably unmitigatable threat (Timmins <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). From the late 1990s there has also been a dramatic upgrading and expansion of national and regional road networks in Lao PDR, primarily it seems to make all inhabited areas of the country readily accessible (W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. 2008). New road linkages in Mondulkiri Province, Cambodia, are making the area’s natural resources more easily marketable (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Since 2008 road development and upgrading has continued and probably even increased in intensity especially in what were once remote border areas (Timmins 2013a, Timmins in press a,b).<br/><br/>Shifting cultivation of local communities is resulting in a net loss of forest and even of dense secondary habitats, and is fragmenting larger forest blocks because of the dispersion of settlements. Shifting cultivation per se could even be beneficial for this muntjac, but recent trends are decreasing the suitability of what might be called ‘the shifting cultivation estate’. These trends centre round a decline in cycle length in rotational systems (hindering regrowth during the fallow period), partly through the increasing number of people depending upon an annually decreasing area, as forest land is lost to infrastructure, tree plantation crops and other forms of continuous agriculture, and partly through well-intentioned government policy to eradicate shifting cultivation. Habitat loss due to shifting cultivation has probably increased in intensity in many habitats of most relevance to the species since 2008, e.g. peripheral degraded forest at mid elevation (Timmins 2013a, Timmins in press a,b) especially in the southern Annamites of Viet Nam where rubber, pine and acacia plantations are targeted on secondary forest patches.<br/><br/>Recent moves towards landscape-scale habitat clearance for agro-industrial developments particularly in plateau areas of Cambodia and southern Viet Nam, and even in foothill areas of northern parts of the Lao and Vietnamese range of the species, would presumably remove available habitat, further fragment remaining forest areas, increase local affluence and result in new roads. However, this muntjac’s potential use of plantations is not assessed, and probably cannot be, because all such developments are increasing the area in which hunting is easy and at high levels (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Since 2008 as with most other threats, habitat loss from concessions appears to be on the increase, with for instance large areas of plateau forest already lost in the Southern Annamites (Timmins in press a).<br/><br/>Hydropower development throughout the Annamites, particularly in the Nam Theun/Nam Kading basin in Lao PDR, floods habitat but more importantly fuels hunting levels through increasing access, affluence and market connectivity. The Nakai Plateau, part of the only area known still to support good numbers of Large-antlered Muntjac, was flooded for a hydropower headpond during mid 2008. This destroyed part of the species' range on the plateau, but the project will continue to stimulate hunting. Currently, there are barely-navigable stretches of rocky channel (called kengs) on all streams flowing out from the NPA. All these kengs will be easily passable when the reservoir is full. As predicted the Nam Theun 2 reservoir has had a huge negative effect on remaining plateau areas and the NPA (W.G. Robichaud and J. W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2015). Nam Kading NPA, further down the same catchment, is also threatened by a hydropower project which will result in a highly dendritic headpond allowing ready access to most of this NPA and so undoubtedly will increase hunting levels significantly. Other reservoirs have in the interim been completed in both Lao PDR (e.g. on the Nam Gnouang) and Viet Nam (e.g., a reservoir abutting the Hue SNR) surely leading to similar consequences (Timmins in press b, R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>Growing economic stability and developing infrastructure in all three range countries have initiated a flood of proposals for industrial-scale mineral extraction, particularly in the mineral-rich Annamites (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). The effects of this on proportionate loss of habitat remain to be seen, they will probably be overshadowed the presence of large numbers of non-local workers with good market connectivity and thus a propensity to hunt, or to pay local people to hunt. In 2015 expansion of mineral concessions has perhaps not been as dramatic as feared, although there are still plans and rumours concerning concessions in many areas, and small-scale gold mining operations are present in many relatively remote forest areas (Timmins 2013a, Timmins in press b).<br/><br/>Recent changes in immigration agreements between Lao PDR and Viet Nam and between Lao PDR and China make it much easier for Vietnamese and Chinese people to visit, settle in and conduct business in Lao PDR, and with a clear build-up of Vietnamese nationals in pivotal wildlife trade centres such as Ban Lak-20 (= ‘Ban Lak Xao’) on the edge of Nakai–Nam Theun NPA, trade networks with Viet Nam are now better than ever and still improving (W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. 2007).<br/><br/>Additional factors hindering the species' survival include:<br/><br/>The difficulties of distinction between this species and Northern Red Muntjac impede its potential legal protection, particularly in situations where a differential status between the Large-antlered and Northern Red applies.<br/><br/>Customary rights of local people to hunt ‘sustainably’ within most Lao and some Vietnamese protected areas urgently need modification if most of the ungulate species are to survive in such areas (see the Conservation Measures section).<br/><br/>As pointed out by Timmins <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2007), protected area management skills and commitment to the system are still evolving in the Annamites, and this progress lags behind expansion of market-led hunting. Currently, existing protected areas are not stanching declines in ungulates. Protected areas have so far proven impotent in the control of poaching or as a mechanism to safeguard areas from economic development such as hydropower projects, road construction, and mining (Timmins <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007). It will require a major consolidation of effort to install effective anti-hunting measures in any protected area within the range of Large-antlered Muntjac within the next five years (Timmins <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008) and protected area strengthening projects should be thinking in terms of a few decades of collaboration, not a few years (e.g., Leisher 2001). Yet, there is even the danger of the few currently promising protected areas regressing through loss of external funding and talented professionals, ongoing political indifference towards them, and thereby forcing an unfettered short-termism in local residents’ behaviour through a lack of alternative options. There is no plausible method to conserve this species (and others of high value to the wildlife trade which show little resilience to hunting) alternative to protected areas, the problem is arising not through a flawed concept, but through naive optimism about the time-scales and resource inputs needed to effect situational change, coupled with insufficient political will to enact effective protected area management by all range state governments.<br/><br/>The potential of Nakai–Nam Theun NPA to conserve the species has fallen far short of expectations. The area receives substantial, guaranteed annual funding from the Nam Theun 2 hydropower project (approximately USD 1 million annually), in compensation for reservoir inundation of wildlife habitat on the Nakai Plateau. As of 2015, after nearly a decade of over USD 1 million being spent per year by the NPA’s management, there is little progress in restraining offtake of ungulates and other wildlife. This reflects low starting capacity resulting from inappropriate staff selection policies, a poorly structured capacity-building programme, no link between performance and provision of annual budget, internal financial irregularities and, most trenchantly, uneven commitment to the protected area’s aims internally, and from the mass of other government bodies with influence over WMPA.. National-level government policy favours tangible aspects of rural development (road building, plantation agriculture, etc.) over what is perceived as ‘wildlife conservation’. Corruption that both protects and promotes the unsustainable offtake of natural resources (e.g., forest timber, wildlife for trade) is also a major issue. The situation reached a crisis point in 2014 when two external reviews corroborated the Nam Theun 2 project’s own International Environmental and Social Panel of Experts’ long-standing and intensifying concerns over continued gross underperformance, and the panel recommended dissolution of the WMPA management structure (McDowell <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). As of late 2015, most WMPA senior staff have in fact been removed, but their replacements have not yet been appointed.<br/><br/>In Bolikhamxay Province to the north, some progress has been made in wildlife conservation, particularly through a decade-long cooperative program between the province and the Wildlife Conservation Society. However, ongoing restriction by the province and central government for program personnel to enter some of the most important areas in the Annamites along the border of Viet Nam, due to unspecified ‘security concerns’, considerably hamper attempts to conserve rare ungulates there if still present, such as Saola and Large-antlered Muntjac.<br/><br/>The only site within the species’ range where levels of law enforcement patrolling and protected management are close to levels required to reduce threats to Large-antlered Muntjac are the Hue and Quang Nam Saola Nature Reserves in central Viet Nam, and possibly some focal areas of Nakai-Nam Theun. However even at these sites it is likely that few, if any, areas are either sufficiently remote, or patrolled with sufficient regularity or intensity, to remove threats to the species. In addition there are no confirmed recent records of Large-antlered Muntjac from the two reserves in Viet Nam, which clearly suffered extensive hunting prior to gazettement, and the species may have become extinct from these sites. Adjacent areas of eastern Xe Sap National Protected Area, Lao PDR, receive little protection and despite efforts to establish enforcement teams with similar mandates as within Hue and Quang Nam, current patrol intensity and levels of snare removal are not close to that required. It should be noted that snare removal in these sites is conducted primarily by trained, local community members, with ranger assistance and support from WWF, not primarily by government staff.<br/><br/>There is a lack of appreciation in the decision-making levels relevant to protected areas, including those with externally collaborative management support projects, of the biodiversity value of lower altitude yet degraded forests relative to high altitude forests which have been less encroached. This results in mis-prioritisation of core protected zones within protected areas. The common situation is that all lower-altitude forests are degraded, and it is this very degradation that makes them of high priority: their conservation status is already so poor that there are no pristine areas left in most of the range of the Large-antlered Muntjac. This is a problem for a wide suite of species restricted to the lower altitudes, not just to this muntjac, but because of its globally small range, it may be the mammal at most global risk through this factor (with the possible exception of Saola).","Evidence for the Large-antlered Muntjac comes from much of the Annamite mountain range, mostly as trophy antlers in villages abutting or within forest (Timmins <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1998, Do Tuoc and Le Trong Trai pers. comm. to R.J. Timmins 1990s, B. Long pers. comm. to R.J. Timmins 2006, W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. to R.J. Timmins 2007, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, 2014, Le Trong Trai pers. comm. 2015). The very little field-based evidence of Large-antlered Muntjac contrasts with Northern Red Muntjac <em>Muntiacus vaginalis </em>being among the most frequently recorded large mammals during field surveys in Lao and Viet Nam (Timmins in press b, Timmins 2013a, Duckworth <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010, Timmins <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1998, Timmins and Ou 2001, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>In most known Lao sites holding Large-antlered Muntjac, few trophies were found compared with those of Northern Red Muntjac, the only exception is the Nakai Plateau and Nakai–Nam Theun NPA where, overall, numbers of trophies of the two species were roughly equal, and which constitute the only area of Lao PDR in which trophy evidence was found commonly over a wide area (Schaller and Vrba 1996, Timmins <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1998). Around the Nam Noy and Nam Phao river basins, Large-antlered Muntjac trophies even outnumber those of Northern Red Muntjac (W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. 2008, based on surveys in 2007–2008). Distribution and relative abundance in the Xe Sap NPA–Dakchung&#160; area, based on the frequency of trophy antlers discovered in villages, another region of the main Annamite spine visited several times appears, by contrast, to be patchy (Timmins 2013a, Schaller and Vrba 1996, Showler <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1998, Steinmetz 1998, Steinmetz <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1999, Timmins <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1998).<br/><br/>During 1998–1999, camera-trapping in Bolikhamxay Province recorded the species only twice (Robichaud and Stuart 1999), which at the time seemed a relatively low ‘encounter’ rate, however given the relatively low effort (probably less than 1,800 trap nights W. Robichaud pers. comm. 2015) in comparison to some recent camera-trapping surveys it now seems noteworthy (R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). More recent but somewhat limited camera-trapping in Phou Chomvoy PPA and Phou Sithone Endangered Species Conservation Area, both areas almost certainly within the historical range of Large-antlered Muntjac, did not detect the species (Timmins in press b, IEWMP unpublished data, Chanthasone_Phommachanh unpublished data), and as already mentioned the species has not been detected by camera-trapping in Nam Kading NPA, although this may be due to camera-trapping being largely in ecologically unsuitable areas (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014 based on WCS unpublished data). A substantial and widespread camera-trapping effort conducted over several years from 2006–2011 in the Nakai–Nam Theun NPA and other areas of the Nakai Plateau recorded many Large-antlered Muntjacs in some sectors in a ‘trap’ encounter rate similar to that of Northern Red Muntjac there (Coudrat <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014a, Robichaud <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> in prep, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2015 based on a review of Watershed Management and Protection Authority [WMPA] unpublished camera-trapping data). The plateau and NPA’s Large-antlered Muntjac population stood out as exceptionally large both in the mid 1990s (when it could be compared with many other sites surveyed using comparable methodology) and in a mid-2000s context (despite a paucity of contemporary similar studies in other sites). In an Indochinese context, the Nakai Plateau and Nakai-Nam Theun NPA were found in 1994–1996 to hold substantial populations of other wildlife which have declined steeply through over-harvest in Indochina. Recent (2006–2007) surveys of the plateau showed that some had by then gone, such as Tiger (<em>Panthera tigris</em>), but others, such as turtles, otters, Asian Elephants (<em>Elephas maximus</em>), and, of most direct relevance to inferring the status of this muntjac, Sambar (<em>Rusa unicolor</em>) remained in numbers outstandingly high compared with other areas surveyed about the same time (Dersu 2008, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). However, occupation of the NPA seems somewhat patchy, not just for ecological reasons: in one of the sectors where camera-trapping was carried out, no Large-antlered Muntjacs were found, although Northern Red Muntjac and the <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> species-complex were recorded frequently (Robichaud <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> in prep.), at the time of the camera-trapping this coincided with the area of the NPA thought on the basis of several lines of evidence to be most heavily affected by hunting (both from Lao and Viet Namese hunters) (R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2015).<br/><br/>In June–July 2010 a short duration camera-trapping project was conducted in Laving Laveun Provincial Protected Area (PPA), in Savannakhet Province, Lao PDR, in forest close to the border with Viet Nam and apparently transitional in nature with Wet Evergreen Forest. This resulted in nine independent detections from seven camera locations, and a further five probable detections from a further two camera locations (Duckworth <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010). Northern Red Muntjac was not certainly camera trapped during the survey, although animals in the <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> species-complex were recorded (Duckworth <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010). Recent camera-trapping in Xe Sap NPA has so far failed to detect Large-antlered Muntjac, although 74% of 4,630 trap-days was at elevations above 1,000 m (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2015 based on WWF Greater Mekong unpublished data, Gray and Thongsamouth in prep), surveys in 2011 also did not find any Large-antlered Muntjac trophies within villages around the periphery of the NPA (Timmins 2013a).<br/><br/>In general, surveys undertaken throughout Lao PDR suggest that typical quarry species of large mammal are well below carrying capacity even within large habitat blocks (Timmins and Ou 2001, Timmins and Duckworth 2008), and the paucity of evidence for the Large-antlered Muntjac elsewhere in its Lao range indicates a conservation status similar to that of wild oxen or large hornbills, rather than to that of other ungulates of comparable size such as other muntjac species or wild pigs. Camera-trapping in Nakai-Nam Theun NPA during 2006–2011 appears to indicate significant declines of ground-dwelling large mammal populations especially Sambar, cats and some small carnivores, by comparison with direct observation and sign surveys in 1994–1996, intensive snaring is now commonplace within the NPA and the area has particularly suffered from incursion from over the Vietnamese border (Coudrat <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014 a,b; Duckworth 1998; Evans <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2000; RJT pers. comm. 2008 based on WMPA unpublished data; W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. 2007). However snaring is still likely to be only a fraction of the intensity of that on average in the majority of Vietnamese Annamite forests (at least those that retain any large mammals of commercial value), and of particular significance in terms of assessing status and trends of large mammals, snaring has only been at a significantly high level in a majority of the NPA for a relatively short time (probably less than 10 years) compared with the considerably more prolonged duration of snaring on average in Vietnamese forests and some other border areas of Lao PDR (R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). Although muntjacs of all species are still apparently numerous in Nakai Nam Theun NPA, significant declines are almost certainly in progress, as on the Nakai Plateau (the semi-quantitative methods used have low power to detect changes even of quite large proportion, if the species is still ‘common’). Elsewhere in Lao PDR over the same period, anecdotal information and a small number of re-surveys suggest that declines in mammals of muntjac size and over (in magnitude obvious even by subjective survey means) are widespread (Timmins and Duckworth 2012; Duckworth in press; Timmins 2013a; Suford 2010; Timmins 2009; Timmins in press a,b; Timmins and Robichaud 2005; J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008 but based largely on areas outside the Large-antlered Muntjac’s range).<br/><br/>In Viet Nam the situation seems to be if anything considerably worse, with no evidence for anything other than very small numbers surviving, although one area which seems to have held large numbers at least into the 1990s has not been re-surveyed. In and around Pu Mat National Park, despite a number of trophies in local villages in the 1990s, fairly intensive camera-trapping in the late 1990s resulted in perhaps only one image of Large-antlered Muntjac compared with dozens portraying Northern Red Muntjac and several showing animals of the <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> group (Timmins <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1998, SFNC 2000, RJT pers. obs. based on SFNC unpublished data). However, the spatial overlap between the areas providing the village trophies and where camera-trapping took place is not known. More recent surveys in Pu Mat National Park, from 2012 and 2013, indicate that ungulate densities have declined precipitously from previous years, suggesting that if anything the situation has worsened (A. Tilker pers. comm. 2015).&#160; Slightly further south in Vu Quang Nature Reserve, Dawson and Do Tuoc (1997) considered Large-antlered Muntjac as common as Northern Red Muntjac, an assessment echoing that from the adjacent Lao area of Nakai–Nam Theun NPA and Nakai Plateau (see above). However, Eve <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> (2001: 45 and 122) concluded a major decline at Vu Quang NR during the 1990s: Dawson (1994) recorded that 13 Large-antlered Muntjacs were caught in snares in the 1993/1994 season alone, and observed one Large-antlered Muntjac in the southern part of the reserve at this time, but in several years’ presence, including various biological surveys, in the late 1990s, no new evidence of the species was recorded.<br/><br/>From Vu Quang NR southwards, there are, as in Lao PDR, sporadic records of trophies, but little information other than, in many instances, anecdotal reports of the species’ scarcity (see the Distribution section).<br/><br/>In Khe Nuoc Trong proposed nature reserve, Le Thuy District, Quang Binh Province, Large-antlered Muntjac was camera-trapped at least once (with two other provisionally identified records) during 2011–2014, all below 200 m elevation over the course of 9,200 trap days using 100 camera-traps (Le Trong Trai pers. comm. 2014, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2015). Extensive camera-trapping in Thua Tien Hue and Quang Nam Provinces between 2002–2006 captured only a single possible Large-antlered Muntjac against numerous pictures of Northern Red Muntjac and several animals of the <em>M. rooseveltorum </em>species-complex (Dickinson and Van Ngoc Thinh 2006, Long 2005, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). More recently between 2012 and 2014 greater than 19,000 camera-trap days from 127 locations largely below 1000 m in the Hue and Quang Nam Saola Nature Reserves did not detect the species with certainty (WWF Greater Mekong unpublished data, T. Gray pers. comm. 2014). This suggests a current rarity that seems to reflect a steep recent decline rather than naturally low densities based on interviews of villagers throughout Quang Nam, Hue and Quang Tri provinces (B. Long pers. comm. 2008). This is corroborated by camera-trapping results for other species, i.e. Sambar only detected from five of 127 locations, Saola only detected from a single location and Crested Argus only detected from two locations (WWF Greater Mekong unpublished data), interview data for Saola based partly on the remains of hunted animals which indicate a significant decline in reports over time (N.M. Wilkinson pers. comm. 2012, 2014, Turvey <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014) and field surveys which have found evidence of high hunting intensity and low abundance of all ungulates in the majority of areas (A. Tilker pers. comm. 2014, R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2015).<br/><br/>In the mid 1990s, two Hanoi institutes obtained five freshly hunted animals from the Lam Ha District, Lam Dong Province in the Southern Annamites (see Distribution) where the species was said to be relatively common (Do Tuoc and Pham Trong Anh pers. comm. to R.J. Timmins). The Da Lat Biology Institute in Lam Dong Province began amassing specimens in 1990 and by October 1995 held only 271 mammal specimens. Remarkably, 19 (in translation: six stuffed mounts, four skinned heads (skulls?) and 9 skins (trophies?)) of these were of <em>M. vuquangensis</em>, against only 12 <em>M. vaginalis</em>. These were the two most numerous mammal species in the collection (Pham Trong Anh <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1996). It is not known if the institute deliberately sought Large-antlered Muntjac, or whether the numbers reflect the relative frequency with which animals were being hunted. The only somewhat relevant survey traced within that region since, a survey of Chu Yang Sin NP, in an adjacent area of Dak Lak Province, camera-trapped the species on a single occasion (BirdLife International 2010, details of survey effort are not given). Given the lack of traced information from Lam Dong present conservation status of Large-antlered Muntjac there is unknown. Southern Viet Nam had in previous decades often proven to harbour less depleted large mammal populations than further north (e.g. Le Xuan Canh <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1997, Polet and Ling 2004), however this may no longer be the case over much of the south, with evidence that hunting intensity and forest loss has greatly increased and become much more similar to the situation in the centre and north (see Threats). In Viet Nam, especially the north, large mammal densities are, in general, even more depressed than in Lao PDR (Tilker 2014, Willcox <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014, Timmins in press a, Timmins <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1999, Timmins and Trinh Viet Cuong 2001, Timmins 2002, Timmins and Ou 2001, Timmins <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2007, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008).",Decreasing,"The Large-antlered Muntjac is known only from the Annamite mountain chain and associated hill ranges of Lao PDR, Viet Nam and, marginally, eastern Cambodia. All current records from Cambodia, like many from Lao PDR and most from Viet Nam, are trophy antlers held by local hunters (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2006, 2015). Large-antlered Muntjac does not inhabit the northern highlands of Lao PDR or Viet Nam, nor the Mekong plain. Its distribution and status in Lao PDR were reviewed by Timmins <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> (1998), but no comparable compilation is available for Viet Nam. There have been no significant extensions of known Lao range since this collation. <br/><br/>In neither Lao PDR nor Viet Nam is there any marked discontinuity in landforms between the Annamite range and the northern highlands. Yet Large-antlered Muntjac seems not to extend into the latter region as defined in Baltzer <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> (2001). In particular, extensive camera-trapping in Nam Et – Phou Louey NPA in the northern highlands of Lao PDR, where mammal populations are, in regional terms, reasonably healthy, has not detected the species despite hundreds of photographs of muntjacs being obtained. It should be noted that the majority of camera locations were at elevations greater than 1,000 m, which are potentially naturally unsuitable for the species (Johnson <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2006, R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2015). Its trophies have been reported furthest to the north-east from the Pu Huong Nature Reserve, Nghe An Province, Viet Nam (Cao Tien Trung and A. Grieser Johns pers. comm. to R.J. Timmins 2008). Searches further north in Viet Nam have not found the species (e.g., Le Trong Trai <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 1999c, Le Trong Trai and Do Tuoc pers. comm. to R.J. Timmins in the 1990s). The most northerly evidence in the main Annamite spine is from Pu Mat National Park, Nghe An Province on the Vietnamese side and from southern Bolikhamxay Province on the Lao side, with presence also to the west in southern Nam Kading NPA (Schaller and Vrba 1996, Timmins <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 1998, SFNC 2000, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). In Lao PDR, the species might yet be found as far north as southern Xiangkhouang Province and Xaysomboun Province, which remain largely unsurveyed, as does most of intervening northern Bolikhamxay Province. The species’s westward limit is unclear, but presence may be localised and dependent on favourable ecological conditions in combination with historical patterns of anthropogenic forest use, with perhaps much lower natural ecological densities in what presumably are suboptimal habitats in the ‘drier’ western regions of central Lao PDR. Relatively extensive camera-trapping in Nam Kading NPA has not detected the species, even in areas where ungulates were clearly still reasonably common for the region, suggesting to some degree a natural pattern, however much of the camera-trapping was apparently at relatively high elevations, and furthermore the southeastern part of the NPA where trophies had been found in peripheral villages in the 1990s was not covered well by camera-trapping (R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2015 based on WCS unpublished data/Tropical Ecology, Assessment and Monitoring (TEAM) Network unpublished data).<br/><br/>South of southern Bolikhamxay Province and southern Nam Kading NPA in Lao PDR, evidence of Large-antlered Muntjac has been found in the Annamites, particularly Nakai–Nam Theun NPA and the Nakai Plateau, and outlying hill ranges including the foothills in and around Phou Xang He NPA, Xe Bang-Nouan NPA and Dong Phou Vieng NPA, the Lao–Vietnamese border area in the region of Hin Namno NPA, south of there in Laving Laveun Provincial Protected Area, and the main body of the central Annamites in Xe Sap NPA, the Dakchung Plateau and Dong Ampham NPA (Timmins 2013a, Duckworth <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010, Schaller and Vrba 1996, Davidson <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 1997, Timmins <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 1998, Steinmetz 1998, Steinmetz <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 1999, Robichaud <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> in prep.). Based on the results from Nam Kading it seems likely that in outlying hill ranges such as Phou Xang He and Xe Bang Nouan the species was naturally always localised.<br/><br/>In Viet Nam, south of Pu Mat National Park, the Large-antlered Muntjac has been recorded in several Annamite sites including Vu Quang Nature Reserve (now National Park), Ha Tinh Province (Dawson and Do Tuoc 1997, Eve <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2001: 45 and 122). From Vu Quang NP southwards, there are, as in Lao PDR, sporadic records of trophies, but little other information save for anecdotal reports of the species’s scarcity (Le Xuan Canh <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 1997, Le Trong Trai and Richardson 1999, Le Trong Trai <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 1999a, 1999b, 2001, Timmins <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 1999, Timmins and Trinh Viet Cuong 2001, Le Manh Hung <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2002, Thua Thien Hue Province Forest Protection Department, Thua Thien Hue and Quang Nam Provinces: B. Long, Kon Plong area, Kon Tum Province: Do Tuoc, A Luoi District, Thua Thien Hue Province and Kon Cha Rang NR, Gia Lai province: Le Trong Trai, all pers. comm. to R.J. Timmins). In the mid 1990s the Forest Inventory and Planning Institute and the Institute of Ecology and Biological Resources obtained two and three, respectively, freshly hunted animals from the Lam Ha District, Lam Dong Province in the Southern Annamites (a region often referred to as the Lang Bian or Dalat Plateau), which they mounted as specimens for the respective institutions (Do Tuoc and Pham Trong Anh pers. comm. to RJT). The Da Lat Biology Institute in Lam Dong in October 1995 held 19 <em>M. vuquangensis</em>, reportedly mostly from some or all of the districts of Lac Duong, Di Linh, Bao Loc and Lam Ha (Pham Trong Anh <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 1996). This area is also one of the few with reasonable historical evidence for Large-antlered Muntjac (Millet 1930, Bauer 1997). No published recent survey has determined the conservation status of the Large-antlered Muntjac in this area, and its southern limit remains poorly known, although the species presumably does not occur south of the southern slopes of the Southern Annamites.<br/><br/>In Cambodia, the Large-antlered Muntjac is known only through trophy antlers seen in villages and markets of the Mondulkiri Plateau (Desai and Lic 1996, Timmins and Ou 2001, Walston 2001). It is probably very localised: extensive camera-trapping at low elevations on the southern slope in Siema Biodiversity Conservation Area has not detected the species (J.L. Walston and T.D. Evans pers. comm. to R.J. Timmins based on WCS unpublished data, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2015 based on a review of WCS camera-trap images in 2011), and at higher elevations closed canopy semi-evergreen forest forms a mosaic with deciduous forests, savanna and grassland, the latter are believed to be unsuitable for the species (Timmins and Ou 2001, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Slight doubt over provenance of trophies in Mondulkiri reflects the heavy trade with Viet Nam (albeit mostly to Viet Nam from Cambodia) and lack of influence on hunters’ movements of the international border. On ecological grounds there seems little question that this muntjac should occur in Cambodia, although it may already have been hunted out.<br/><br/>CBD and BGMNP (2012) state that three individuals of this species were camera-trapped during a project run by Bu Gia Map NP in Binh Phuoc Province, southern Viet Nam, on the border with Siema BCA. A picture of a muntjac labelled as “Mang lớn <em>Megamuntiacus vuquangensis</em>?” (CBD and BGMNP 2012: pg 45) is unclear, but is almost certainly not a Large-antlered Muntjac, no further details of the camera-trapping project or the purported Large-antlered Muntjac photos are given (Timmins <em>in press</em> a). Given the propensity in general for camera-trap photos to be misidentified (e.g., AWCSG–GWC 2011) and the subtle differences between Large-antlered and Northern Red Muntjacs (Timmins <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 1998, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014) it is best that these reports are discounted until the pictures can be independently verified (Timmins <em>in press</em> a).","Large-antlered Muntjacs are hunted within a thriving hunting and wildlife trading culture which abounds in all range states and in adjacent countries such as China and Thailand. Hunters do not target Large-antlered Muntjacs, but are seeking any and all species with marketable meat and products for the medicinal markets. Such hunting reaches all this muntjac’s range, and with so many species and products, non-selective methods continue at high levels until the most resilient species is no longer common enough for hunting to be commercially viable. This non-specificity makes regional hunting practices a peculiarly strong driver of localised and, in aggregate, regional, extinctions (e.g., Tungittiplakorn and Dearden 2002). While demand for wild meat is the major driver of muntjac trade, parts such as antlers may be used for medicinal purposes. There is also the curio/status symbol appeal of trophy antlers: some are even on display in Bangkok (A.J. Lynam pers. comm. 2000). Since 2008 there appears to have been an upsurge in the trade in trophy antlers (of all species), to the extent that it is now often difficult to find Large-antlered Muntjac trophies within villages, the trade appears to favour trophies with large antlers (Timmins 2013a, R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014), one can only speculate that this will inevitably increase pressure on the species. Economic development and expanding wealth in the region are increasing the demand for wildlife meat and ‘medicines’ (Timmins <em>et al</em>. 2007).",Terrestrial,"This species is listed in CITES – Appendix I.<br/><br/>The survival of the Large-antlered Muntjac depends on the viability of populations within protected areas, many of which (particularly in Lao PDR) are currently potentially highly suitable for the species due to their typically large size (Timmins <em>et al.</em> 1998, see also Timmins and Duckworth 1999, Timmins and Duckworth 2008). Although Large-antlered Muntjac populations within protected areas face unrestrained hunting, populations outside protected areas are likely to be faring even less well. The limited success to-date for protected areas is a reflection of the time it takes to form an effectively functioning system (see threats), rather than a demonstration that the species would better be conserved outside them. Actions of primary importance include the stemming of further habitat loss at lower altitudes and, most importantly, controls on hunting (Timmins <em>et al.</em> 1998).<br/><br/>The single most important conservation measure for the Large-antlered Muntjac is to develop an effective conservation management system in Nakai–Nam Theun NPA, and to help strengthen protection activities there, especially through building technical capacity, and the appointment of senior staff with motivation to conserve wildlife. Initiation of effective protection and management in Laving–Laveun NPA is similarly important, as it may be in a contiguous provincial protected area to the north of Laving-Laveun, Khoun Xe Nong Ma PPA, in Khammouane Province, Lao PDR. As of late 2015, the Nam Theun 2-funded protected area management project for Nakai-Nam Theun has made minimal progress despite receiving many million dollars (see ‘Threats’). Xe Sap NPA, in southern Laos, has recently been the beneficiary of a large conservation project, ""Carbon and Biodiversity"" (CarBi), coordinated by WWF and funded mainly by the German development bank, KfW. Components of the project have focused on training and supervising a small number of anti-poaching patrols in Xe Sap. Unfortunately, as of 2015, project funds for Xe Sap patrolling were nearly exhausted. Few other protected areas within the Lao or Vietnamese range of the species currently have more than paper protection. Conservation management needs much wider recognition of the value of lower-altitude forests in protected areas throughout the species’ range (see the Threats section).<br/><br/>The status of the species is very little understood in the southern Annamites and so a focus there should be on status assessments. If sites are found with significant numbers then they would automatically become priorities for enhanced management and protection.<br/><br/>At its meeting in 2013, the Saola Working Group of the IUCN SSC Asian Wild Cattle Specialist Group, adopted a “zero threats” goal for Saola priority areas, that is, that the protection goal should be “…zero active snares (and other traps that pose risk to Saola), zero domestic hunting dogs and zero illegal firearms in priority Saola areas” (Saola Working Group 2013). The rationale for this goal is that for a Critically Endangered species like Saola, any level of snaring or hunting where some Saolas might survive presents a significant threat to the species’ survival. With Large-antlered Muntjac now also elevated to Critically Endangered, the same “zero threats” goal is likewise appropriate.<br/><br/>Conservation breeding is often proposed when animals are in imminent danger of extinction, a point at which in some, perhaps many, cases it may be too late to save the species by any means. As Large-antlered Muntjac appears to be following a status trajectory similar to that of Saola, a species for which conservation breeding is now recognised as the priority intervention (albeit later than would have been optimal), it would be prudent to initiate conservation breeding as soon as possible for Large-antlered Muntjac. Conservation breeding for Saola could theoretically be relatively easily combined with that for Large-antlered Muntjac. As for Saola, there are no known Large-antlered Muntjacs in captivity anywhere in the world today, so such a program would have to start from zero. Fortunately, for the time-being, Large-antlered Muntjac remains relatively easily detectable within probably at least two areas of Lao PDR, making capture potentially possible less challenging.<br/><br/>Considering the genetic distance between the animals in the northern-central Annamites and the southern Annamites, a conservation breeding program may well be needed in southern Vietnam also.<br/><br/>Management in all protected areas within the species’s range must address the issues of how customary hunting by local people can be reconciled with the conservation of Critically Endangered species. The magnitude of difficulty of this balancing act is often underestimated, through an uncritical acceptance of the fact (in any case, disputable, when status of rhinoceroses in South-east Asia and a multitude of species in south-central China is considered) that before ‘international’ conservation principles and practice these species did not become extinct under the custodianship of customary hunting. This is a flawed comparison because in the intervening period human populations have exploded, much wildlife habitat has been lost to other land uses, modern weapons allow far more effective harvest of wildlife than did any customary techniques, and modern connectivity and urban affluence have generated a limitless market for wild meat (e.g. Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 2012). In sum, many more people depend on a far smaller area than before, and a new, infinite market can be met using hunting methods which previously did not exist. This means that there is no possibility that unfettered ‘customary’ hunting can conserve ungulates in Lao PDR and Viet Nam, even if ‘customary hunting’ could be defined in a modern context. Greater recognition is also urgent that the two groups that will chiefly bear the damage of current heavy hunting are, self-evidently, the wildlife and, perhaps paradoxically, the local communities: after the current short-term bonanza is over, local people who have not bought their way out of subsistence (and current trends suggest this will be a large proportion of them: most of the financial benefits of wildlife trade flow to already-urbanised traders and other adventives) will lose this income source and most of their non-fish protein. Instead of the currently sterile polarisation within conservation implementing agencies of ‘local people vs wildlife’, which would better be termed ‘short-term human interest vs long-term human interest’, universal recognition that wild mammals are fundamental to rural poverty alleviation is needed (Krahn and Johnson 2007). Inviolate non-hunting core areas may be the most important tool in meeting this challenge. Even though they can legally be established in protected areas in both countries, there has been minimal progress in generating on-ground reality in this regard. Designation and outlining of core areas needs to flow from biologically sound analyses of population needs of species such as the Large-antlered Muntjac, to prevent core areas too small to sustain off-take in surrounding hunting zones or even survival within the core zones themselves. It is important that core areas are not selected starting from the assumption that they will be the areas traditionally not part of local community hunting areas: in many protected areas, these will be remote high-altitude terrain, and thus largely unsuitable for Large-antlered Muntjac. There is the danger that this occurs through the well-meaning intention, to minimise disruption to already marginalized communities. Instead, a longer-term viewpoint is necessary, that if core areas do not succeed in protecting populations of favoured quarry mammals, serious dietary and resource-flow disruption to these same communities is inevitable. It is already happening in some parts of Lao PDR (Krahn and Johnson 2007) and, presumably, Viet Nam.<br/><br/>Surveys for the Large-antlered Muntjac (a combination of searches for evidence in local villages followed by camera-trapping) in Vietnamese portions of the Southern Annamites, especially Lam Dong Province, are needed, and on the basis of results, site-based conservation interventions may be warranted. The same may be true for yet-to-be identified areas of the southern Central Annamites. The weak understanding of Large-antlered Muntjac’s habitat use means that any indirect means (e.g. through habitat cover) to propose key sites for conservation intervention may simply overlook not just the best, but even any plausibly sensible, areas to select.<br/><br/>The Cambodian population, if extant, may be covered partly by the one or more protected areas (Phnom Nam Lyr WS, Mondulkiri Protection Forest, Siema Biodiversity Conservation Area), other parts of it might, however, occur outside these areas. There are, however, no serious protection activities within its presumed national range. Camera-trapping surveys are warranted, and on the basis of results localised species-specific conservation interventions might be appropriate.",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global
22155877,41788,Cervus nippon,Least Concern,,2015,2014-11-17 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Listed as Least Concern because of its abundant, increasing population in Japan, and stable population in Russia. The subpopulation in Taiwan is evidently holding steady. However, all other free-ranging subpopulations are very seriously threatened. In China all subpopulations are small (the largest numbering about 500) and fragmented, and the species appears to be in danger of extirpation in Korea and Viet Nam (possibly already extinct). In terms of applying the Red List Criteria to the species globally, the large subpopulation in Japan masks all population trends from elsewhere within its range, leading to a Least Concern listing. However, it is a priority to conduct new assessments of the mainland subspecies as soon as possible.","This species prefers woodlands and forest with dense understorey, but forages in open grassy areas (Smith and Xie 2008). The main diet includes grass, some browse, and even fruit. The species is crepuscular, but sometimes active by day and night, and forages singly or in small herds, with dominant males with harems. Herds migrate to lower valleys in winter. Adults can live up to 25 years. Typically, mating occurs in autumn and gestation is about 210-223 days with young being born in April and May.<br/><br/>In Tiebu Nature Reserve, Sichuan, Sika were reported to forage preferentially in small patches of subalpine shrub and subalpine brush mixed with forest (Guo 2002). Sika fed on a wide variety of plant species in Teibu. In Viet Nam, diet of <em>C. n. pseudaxis</em> was reported to included browse and fruits (Dang Huy Huynh, Tran Van Duc, and Hoang Minh Khien pers. comm.). In Taiwan, <em>C. n. taiouanus</em> inhabited open forests and grasslands of valley bottoms and foothills below 300 m (McCullough 1974, Horng-jye Su undated). <em>C. n. mandarinus</em> and <em>C. n. grassianus</em> probably occurred in upland forests  (IUCN 1972). <em>C. n. keramae</em> favours lowland forests and plains (WWF 1984). In Viet Nam, <em>C. n. pseudaxis</em> group size was 5-30 animals (Dang Huy Huynh, Tran Van Duc, and Hoang Minh Khien pers. comm.). In China, <em>C. e. sichuanicus</em> forms large aggregations during May-August (Sheng Helin and Zhang Endi pers. comm.). In Viet Nam, <em>C. n. pseudaxis</em> was thought to be primarily sedentary, although some seasonal movement took place depending on water availability (Dang Huy Huynh, Tran Van Duc and Hoang Minh Khien pers. comm.). In China, rut occurs during September-November. Fawning occurs in May-July following a 210-213 day gestation. Single fawns are the rule, but twins are sometimes observed among prime-aged females (Guo and Zheng 2005). Sexual maturity is reached at 1.5 years (Sheng and Ohtaishi 1993).","This species is threatened by habitat loss and hunting, particularly in Viet Nam, China, and the Koreas. The species is increasing in Japan (where it is hunted and culled to reduce crop and forest depredation), and stable in Russia and probably Taiwan. The subspecies in Viet Nam (<em>C. n. pseudaxi</em>) and Taiwan (<em>C. n. taiouanus</em>) were hunted for meat and antler velvet for use in traditional medicine (Dang Huy Huynh <em>et al</em>. 1990, McCullough 1974). In Viet Nam, velvet from <em>Cervus nippon</em> is traded in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City (Dang Huy Huynh, Tran Van Duc, and Hoang Minh Khien pers. comm.). All subspecies of Sika have been hunted widely in China during the past 100 years (Ohtaishi and Gao 1990) and in Korea. In Japan, Red Deer farming used to be very popular, but now animals are being released into the wild raising the risk of hybridization in the wild with <em>Cervus nippon</em>. Native and introduced populations are threatened by hybridization, with numerous populations of uncertain provenance or mixed ancestry (Grubb 2005). In China, in addition to continued loss of habitat, loss of genetic diversity through anthropogenic population subdivision is also a conservation concern (Lu <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/><em>C. n. pseudaxis</em> in Viet Nam, and <em>C. n. mandarinus</em> and <em>C. n. taiouanus</em> in China, were probably extirpated in the wild as a result of hunting and habitat conversion for agriculture (Ratajszczak 1990; Dang Huy Huynh, Tran Van Duc and Hoang Minh Khien pers. comms.; IUCN 1972). The small captive population of <em>C. n. pseudaxis</em> in Cuc Phuong National Park is presently threatened by poaching. In China, <em>C. e. sichuanicus</em> is threatened by poaching outside Tiebu Nature Reserve (Sheng Helin and Zhang Endi pers. comm. 1990), and by encroachment on their habitats (including by deer farms; Hu 1998). In Japan, <em>C. n. keramae</em> has been almost extirpated by hunting, and remains only on unoccupied islets where competition with feral goats and habitat change constitute serious threats (Anonymous 1990). Water pollution is a serious problem for the deer (WWF 1984).","There are no global population estimates. However, in summary, there is a large and growing population in Japan, and a stable population of 8,500-9,000 in Russia, but the species is in serious trouble in the rest of its range. There are probably fewer than 1,000 left in China, scattered in a few subpopulations across a once vast range. It is extinct in South Korea, and probably extinct in North Korea and Viet Nam. It also became extinct on Taiwan, but has been re-introduced there. More detailed information is provided below.<br/><br/><em>China</em>: Four subspecies of Sika are present in mainland China of which three are threatened and one, <em>C. n. mandarinus</em>, is probably extinct. There are 400-500 <em>C. n. sichuanicus</em> in the extreme north of Sichuan and in southern Gansu Province (Hu 1998), as well in two other areas (Baxi and Beihe) of Sichuan (Guo 2000). <em>C. n. kopschi</em> occurs as five isolated small populations: in the Tianmu Mountains region of northern Zhejiang (less than 30 animals); in southern Anhui (70-100); near the border with Jiangsu, in Pengze, Jiangxi (150 animals); in southern Guangxi; and possibly in northern Guangdong. <em>C. n. grassianus</em> occurred in two separate and declining populations in western Shanxi but has not been reported for some years and may now be extinct (Ohtaishi and Gao 1990; Sheng Helin and Zhang Endi pers. comm., 1990). The total number in China was estimated to be no more than 1,000 animals, with populations fragments (Hu 1998). Sika are believed to be declining in all of their remaining range within China (Hu 1998, Guo 2000), although  analyses of survival of <em>C. n. sichuanicus</em> in Tiebu Nature Reserve during the late 1980s suggest a possible reversal of that trend (Guo and Zheng 2005).<br/><br/><em>Korea</em>: Sika was reportedly common and widespread in north and central Korea but declined severely during the Japanese occupation of the country. After liberation it proved impossible to rebuild populations naturally from the surviving dispersed animals in Hamgyong North province, so the DPRK government initiated a captive breeding programme (Won Hong Koo 1968). The genetic purity of these animals is unclear as is their relationship to the Sika held captive in DPRK nowadays. Sika is either very rare or extinct as a wild animal in DPR Korea (J.W. Duckworth in litt. 2008). If it survives in DPR Korea, it will be in the extreme northeastern part of the country (Won and Smith 1999). It no longer survives in the wild in South Korea (Won and Smith 1999), including on Cheju Island.<br/><br/><em>Japan</em>: The species survives near heavily populated areas of Honshu, and their populations had been severely fragmented and reduced due to human activities (Yuasa <em>et al</em>. 2007). However, the Sika Deer population has been conspicuously increasing throughout Japan in recent years as hunting has been brought under control. On Hokkaido, for example, Sika have increased greatly during the last decades of the 20<sup>th</sup> century and the early 21<sup>st</sup> century (Agetsuma <em>et al</em>. 2007), and are now considered an agricultural and forest-plantation pest (Uno and Kaji 2006). Experimental hunting of males began in the 1950s, culling of females in the 1980s and hunting of females in the 1990s (Halley <em>et al</em>. 2006). <em>C. n. keramae</em> was introduced to the Kerama Islands from the Japanese mainland during the 17<sup>th</sup> century, and is reported to have subsequently developed as an insular form (IUCN 1972).<br/><br/><em>Russia</em>: According to Kuzyakin (n.d.), there are 8,500-9,000 Sika Deer in Russia, and the population is stable.<br/><br/><em>Taiwan</em>: <em>C. n. taiouanus</em> is endemic to Taiwan. It was extirpated by 1969 and re-introduced to Kenting National Park in 1988 (Green 1989).  <br/><br/><em>Viet Nam</em>: The species may now be extinct in the wild in this country. In 1990, two to four animals were reported from the western Nghe Tinh Mountains (Dang Huy Huynh <em>et al</em>. 1990), but it is highly doubtful that they survive there. Captive populations are present in Cuc Phuong National Park and Cat Ba National Park (Dang Huy Huynh <em>et al</em>. 1990).",Increasing,"The Sika was distributed across east Asia, from central China in the west to Japan and Korea in the east, and from the extreme eastern tip of Russia in the north to southern China and Viet Nam. Specifically, it was originally found in China (formerly from Manchuria south to Guangxi, and Sichuan to Anhui), North and South Korea (including Cheju Island) (but now probably extinct in both countries), Japan, Russia (a few places in Primorsky in the Far East), Taiwan (extinct in 1969, but subsequently re-introduced), and Viet Nam (probably now extinct). Wild populations are now very localized in China. In Japan, the species ranges widely from Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu, islands in the Seto Inland Sea (Awaji, Shodo, and others), Goto Islands, Ika, Yakushima, Mageshima, Kuchinoerabu-shima, Tsushima, and the Kerama Islands (introduced) (Okinawa Prefecture) (Abe 2005).<br/><br/>In China, <em>C. n. mandarinus</em> probably ranged across much of northeastern China, but by the mid-1930s its range had contracted to northeastern Jilin (IUCN 1972, Guo 1992), and is now believed to be extinct (Hu 1998, Smith and Xie 2008). <em>C. n. grassianus</em> ranged throughout western Shanxi Province, China (Ohtaishi and Gao 1990, Guo 1992), and is now believed to be extinct (Hu 1998, Smith and Xie 2008).<em> C. n. kopschi</em> ranged from the Yangtze River Basin eastward to the coast, and south as far as northern Guangdong Province (IUCN 1972); it remains in small numbers in southern China. <em>C. e. taiouanus</em> was widely distributed throughout Taiwan (Green 1989). Free ranging populations were extirpated in 1969, but captive individuals were re-introduced in 1989 (Smith and Xie 2008). <em>C. n. pseudaxis</em> was recorded from Cao Bang, Quang Ninh, Thanh Hoa, Hanoi, and Nghe Tinh provinces in Viet Nam (Dang Huy Huynh <em>et al</em>. 1990), but is probably now extinct in the wild (captive animals remain). <br/><br/>The species has been widely introduced. In the Philippines it was anciently introduced to Solo Island, with questions remaining as to its continued existence there. It was introduced in 17<sup>th</sup> century to Kerama Islands (Ryukyu Islands, Japan); and introduced in 19<sup>th</sup>-20<sup>th</sup> centuries to British Isles, mainland Europe (Armenia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Lithuania, Poland, western Russia, and Ukraine), New Zealand, USA, and small islands off Japan (Whitehead 1993, Wemmer 1998, Grubb, 2005). It is also widely farmed in Asia, particularly in China (Green <em>et al.</em>&#160;2007, Smith and Xie 2008). Only the native, extant range is included in the distribution map.",See Threats for details on Use and Trade.,Terrestrial,"The species is heavily depleted in the wild in China, and two of the Chinese subspecies may be extinct (<em>mandarinus</em> and <em>grassianus</em>), and others are threatened. However, large herds exist in captivity in China to meet the demand for velvet antlers used in traditional Asian medicine.<br/><br/>The species occurs in a number of protected areas, including: <em>C. n. sichuanicus</em> in China's Tiebu Nature Reserve (Guo 2000, Guo and Zheng 2005), and Baihe Nature Reserve (Hu 1998); <em>C. n. kopschi</em> in China's Taohonglin Nature Reserve (Hu 1998); <em>C. n. hortulorum</em> in Russia's Dalnevostochny Morskoy, Kedrovaya Pad, Khankaisky, Lazovsky, and Sikhote-Alinsky Nature Reserves; and <em>C. n. taiouanus</em> in Taiwan's Kenting National Park, as a result of The Formosan Deer Restoration Project was initiated in 1984 to re-establish subspecies (Green 1989).

The rise in hunting reflects institutional and socio-economic factors which are not readily reversible and therefore speedy solution is unlikely. Open-country herding deer are very susceptible to inadequately managed hunting in tropical Asia. This decline is continuing, except in national parks and inaccessible areas, but increased government surveillance and lower numbers of animals has meant that loss due to hunting is decreasing. The main threat now appears to be loss of habitat (G. Dryden pers. comm. 2014).","This is essentially a tropical and subtropical grassland species (Medway 1977; Oka 1998) but is highly flexible, with successful populations in forests, mountains, shrublands and marshes (Whitehead 1993, Oka 1998, Rouys and Theuerkauf 2003, Keith and Pellow 2005). It is found from sea-level to 900 m asl (G. Semiadi pers. comm., S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008). Some subpopulations make seasonal movements; for example, on New Guinea numbers in the border area between West Papua and Papua New Guinea peak during the wet season, whereas in the dry season many move to the interior of Papua New Guinea (Semiadi 2006).<br/><br/>In diet it is&#160;adaptable, as indicated by its dentition and mouth shape (Dryden and Bisseling 1999),&#160;and will eat herbs, the leaves and bark of shrubs, and even seaweed (Kitchener <em>et al</em>. 1990, Oka 1998, Keith and Pellow 2005), although it seems to prefer certain types of grass (Kitchener <em>et al</em>. 1990, Oka 1998), including in its native range (S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008). In New Caledonia and Australia, it is a threat to native trees (de Garine-Wichatitsky <em>et al</em>. 2005, Keith and Pellow 2005). In the Torres Strait Islands, mating occurs during spring (September-October) and calves are born in autumn (April-May). In other parts of Australia, Javan Deer seems to breed at any time of the year, with a mating peak from late June to August, and a calving peak from March to April (Kitchener <em>et al</em>. 1990). In Indonesia it is said to breed all year around (Whitehead 1993), although a June-September increase in mating activity was found in Bali (Oka 1998), and in Java there is a peak of mating behaviour between July and September (S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008).&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">Where hunting or other disturbance is not a big problem, Javan Deer are primarily diurnal, gathering in large groups in open areas at night. The rut tends to involve a lot of nocturnal activity, even in undisturbed/low hunting areas (Oka 1998, S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008 based on observations in East Java). Javan Deer are more social than their congeners (Kitchener <em>et al. </em>1990). Herds are segregated by sex, except during the mating season, and may comprise up to 25 individuals (Kitchener <em>et al.</em> 1990).","Java has highly fragmented natural habitats and has done for centuries, reflecting long-standing high human population densities. Many protected areas were established during the Dutch colonial period but from independence up until the 1970s they were largely under-funded and neglected. After hosting the World Parks Conference in 1982, the Indonesian government gazetted a swathe of national parks and more structured conservation planning began, funded by the World Bank and other donors. The focus was largely on the 'multi-function' national parks and much money was spent on infrastructure, some staff training and increased personnel. The 'lesser' protected areas such as ""wildlife reserves"" and ""nature reserves"" still had few staff and resources, and that has continued to the present. There was some habitat loss from protected areas through illegal logging, agricultural encroachment and other offtake, but the national parks of Java (several of which contain ideal habitat for Javan Deer and, at least into the mid 1990s, very large populations) remained remarkably intact for much of the period. During the 1980s and early to mid 1990s guns were tightly controlled and the military and police were feared and respected. The strong culture of caged bird keeping meant that hunting, including that within protected areas, was primarily for birds and some small game, through various forms of trapping, including snaring. Thus there was relatively little hunting of Javan Deer and populations were stable or even increasing. Socio-political changes from 1997 led to a reduction in the respect for the police and military and the rise of a viewpoint that protected areas were the peoples' resources and would therefore benefit from decentralised management (M. Tyson pers. comm. 2008). This policy change, which risked a ""tragedy of the commons"", has indeed led to increased habitat destruction and poaching in the past decade. The Javan Deer, as a large deer, is particularly threatened by this rapid rise in illegal hunting (S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008) and also by expansion of agriculture on Java and other forms of encroachment (G. Semiadi pers. comm.; S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008.). In Java, this deer is poached with snares and dogs, but mostly with guns in the late 1990s and 2000s (S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008). The Javan Deer is now seen as a source of extra income and of animal protein by many local communities despite being legally protected (Semiadi 2006) and coupled with the decentralisation of conservation management decisions and actions, macro-economic fluctuations and reduced authority of The Law, this impedes control of illegal hunting (S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008). Poaching has reportedly reduced numbers at Baluran National Park, formerly the largest population within the native range, and more widely across Java, but data are insufficient to determine rate of decline (E. Meijaard pers. comm. 2008). Similar trends are likely on Bali. In the rest of its Indonesian range, e.g. Sulawesi, where it is introduced and thus populations are not used in assessing the Red List Category, it is also heavily hunted and there were major population declines in the late 1990s, although at least on Sulawesi the population is now in slow recovery (G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2008). Poaching of this species in its native range is for meat, medicinal products (some traded internationally), handicrafts products, and, locally, pets.<br/><br/>During the 1980s-1990s, when poaching and land conversion were relatively well under control in Javan national parks, the chief threat to the large population of Javan Deer in Baluran National Park was loss of grazing area to invasion by the introduced tree <em>Acacia nilotica</em> (Leguminosae) that converts open grassland to dense thorny scrub-forest. This plant was introduced (without adequate risk assessment) as part of an attempt  to create a living fire-break around the park's grasslands, wild fire then being adjudged the major threat to the park's monsoon forests. Since that introduction, repeated cutting of the acacia has led to coppicing into very dense thickets that conta<em>in litt</em>le or no grass or other herbs and are difficult for the deer to penetrate. Thus habitat loss and poaching are now serious limiting factors in Baluran National Park, and habitat loss/degradation remains a severe long-term threat to be addressed (S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008). <em>Lantana camara</em> (Verbenaceae) is also a problem in Javan Deer habitat in Baluran National Park and elsewhere on Java (S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008).","<p>The Javan Rusa is common in much of its current range (Kitchener <em>et al</em>. 1990, Corbet and Hill 1992, Whitehead 1993, Heinsohn 2003, Moriarty 2004). Most populations are outside the native range (Corbet and Hill 1992, Whitehead 1993, Heinsohn 2003, Moriarty 2004), including some of the most buoyant: New Caledonia (de Garine-Wichatitsky <em>et al</em>. 2004), where the population is at least 120,000 (Desvals <em>et al.</em> 1992); Mauritius where numerous at circa 60,000, and an ecological problem (R.J. Safford <em>in litt</em>. 2008); Sulawesi and the Maluku islands (Indonesia; G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2008), Pulau Moyo (= Moyo island, a small island in the eastern part of Nusa Tenggara Timur, where deer are protected by local people; G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2008) and West Papua, Indonesia (over 8,000 estimated in Wasur National Park alone, in 1992; Anon. 1994). 4000 Javan Rusas were introduced from New Caledonia in the 1990s and are said to be expanding (Maudet 1999). There are sizeable populations (5,000 to 10,000 animals) located in New South Wales, Australia, and several small (&lt;100 animals) wild herds in the coastal areas of Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland (Moriarty 2004). The Rusa population was estimated to be 16,000 in 2000 (Moriarty 2004). Wild herd sizes appear to be increasing, as indicated by encroachment of Rusas into peri-urban areas in Sydney and Brisbane. A small population of Javan Rusa was introduced to the North Island of New Zealand, which is reportedly unlikely to expand (Fraser <em>et al.</em>&#160;2000).</p><p><br/></p>Conversely, populations have decreased substantially in some areas on Java, where it is a native (Semiadi 2006), including Baluran National Park which (at least in the 1990s) held the largest Javan Rusa population within its natural range. In 1996, 2,500-3,000 Javan Rusas were counted during a census when multiple teams of observers deployed simultaneously throughout deer habitat (Anonymous 1996, S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008). Between 12 September 1998 and 18 January 1999, the population was thought to be greater than 1,000 head and it is very likely to have declined still further. Major declines have also occurred in Alas Purwo National Pak (S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008). Even in the 1980s-mid 1990s, Bali had very few populations, probably only one of significance: in Bali Barat National Park (S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008). There are probably no more than ten populations in the native range (= Java and Bali) and given the size of the Baluran population, it is implausible that there could be more than 10,000 mature individuals within the native range (which would imply a census population of about 13,000-20,000) even in the mid-1990s (S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008).&#160;<span lang=""EN-NZ"">In 2014 the native population is thought to have continued to decrease except for the herds in relatively well managed <span lang=""EN-US"">protected areas such as Ujung Kulon and Meru Betiri National Parks in Java, <span lang=""EN-NZ"">(G.

It has been introduced to many other islands of the Indo-Pacific region (Corbet and Hill 1992, Heinsohn 2003, Grubb 2005,&#160;<span lang=""EN-NZ"">Groves and Grubb 2011). Some introductions apparently took place in antiquity within present-day Indonesia, to the Lesser Sunda islands, Maluku (= Molucca) islands (including Buru and Seram), Sulawesi, and Timor. On Timor, the species inhabits both West Timor (part of Indonesia) and Timor Leste (G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2008, based on 1998 data). Indonesian islands with introduced populations include: Alor, Ambon, Banda, Batjan, Buru, Butung, Flores, Halmahera, Komodo, Lembeh, Lombok, Mangole, Muna, Papua, Sanana, Saparua, Seram, Sulawesi, Sumba, Sumbawa, Taliabu, Ternate, Timor, and Wetar (Wiradteti pers. comm.). Like many large deer, the Javan Rusa is an able swimmer (Kitchener <em>et al</em>. 1990), hindering determination of its native range. The originally introduced population in Borneo is now probably extinct (Payne <em>et al</em>. 1985, G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2008), but in the 1990s soldiers returning from Timor brought some Javan Rusas to at least the Tanah Grgot and Penajam Paser Utara districts in East Kalimantan. Hybridization of Sambar <em>R. unicolor</em> (which occurs naturally in Borneo) with the introduced Javan Rusas has been confirmed from molecular and morphology in one captive herd (221 heads) belonging to the East Kalimantan Province's Animal Husbandry Office at Penajam Paser Utara district (G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/><p><span lang=""EN-NZ"">Javan Rusas were introduced to New Caledonia in the 1870s (Maudet 1999), and to Mauritius and Reunion Island in 1639. According to R.J. Safford (pers. comm. 2008) Réunion received several introductions from Mauritius; the current population is derived mainly from five batches introduced in 1954. Also seven (individual) Red Deer <em>Cervus elaphus</em> were introduced from France; the final outcome with the latter (including any hybridization with Javan Rusas which may or may not have occurred) is unknown but nowadays 'deer' are not common on Réunion, although they are still present in a few areas, and are a pest where they occur. Rodrigues holds no Javan Rusas, although there was a failed attempt to introduce them (Cheke and Hume 2008). Introductions have been made in the 20<sup>th</sup> century to New Zealand (1907, Fraser <em>et al.</em> 2000), Malaysia (1993/4), and to Brazil, Madagascar and Thailand (Maudet 1999). Javan Rusas were introduced to the Port Moresby region of Papua New Guinea from Java in 1900 (Maudet 1999) and a small population has persisted there and has spread north into the Owen Stanley Range with a herd near Wewak on the north coast; introductions to islands of the Bismarck Archipelago have either not persisted or are present in small numbers (Mammals of Papua 2009-2014). The first introductions to Australia were to Victoria (1868) and New South Wales (1890) (Maudet 1999) and wild herds of Rusas have spread to Queensland and South Australia (Moriarty 2004).</p><p><span lang=""EN-NZ""><br/></span></p><p><span lang=""EN-NZ"">Javan Rusas of Moluccan origin were introduced to West Papua in the first quarter of the 20th century; their range now includes the southern coastal plains of New Guinea from the Gulf of Papua to the Fak-Fak Peninsula, and the <span lang=""EN-US"">Doberai Peninsula<span lang=""EN-US""> and foothills of the Foja Mountains in the north <span lang=""EN-NZ"">(Mammals of Papua 2009-2014).&#160;An introduction was probably attempted onto Anjouan, in the Comoros, in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, but Javan Rusa is long extinct there (Louette 2004). On Madagascar, Javan Rusas were introduced near Périnet (Andasibe) around 1930, survived until at least 1955 but is now extirpated, probably having disappeared in the 1960s (Goodman and Benstead 2003: 1172-1173).

Introduced populations are not counted as part of this assessment.</span></span></p>","The wild native population is hunted for food, medicinal products, and handicraft products.&#160;When taken from the wild, specimens are usually killed during the capture process, with the exception of some juveniles which may be kept as pets (Semiadi 2005). Commonly firearms are the weapon of choice for this type of game.<br/><br/>The species is commercially farmed in Australia, New Caledonia, Mauritius, Réunion, and Thailand (de Vos 1982, le Bel 1997) and has been farmed experimentally in Indonesia (Java) and Papua New Guinea (de Vos 1982, Tapari 1990). Farming is mainly for venison and velvet. It is also hunted for its meat (and velvet) in many parts of Indonesia, New Guinea and New Caledonia (Semiadi 2006).

22157664,41784,Axis porcinus,Endangered,A2bcd,2015,2014-12-03 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"It is still believed that the most appropriate category for Hog Deer is Endangered A2bcd (past reduction of 50% or greater in three generations, taken here as about 21 years). A detailed assessment of the Red List status of Hog Deer in 2008 convincingly showed that the species had been undergoing a serious and overlooked global decline for decades. Those authors provided the following justification which, with few caveats, is considered to still hold true for the 2014 assessment: it is considered Endangered, through a combination of population trends across its range (see below). Reflecting the ever-increasing proportion of the total native population in well secured protected areas such as Kaziranga, despite an ongoing major reduction in occupancy and number of subpopulations, future declines in the total number of animals (A3 and A4) are unlikely to be at rates in the next three generations sufficient for Endangered. However, without concerted action, within the next decade or two Hog Deer is likely to warrant again listing as Endangered through a different criterion, B2ac (c through episodic flood-caused mass mortality), reflecting the loss of all subpopulations except a handful in protected areas with effective cohesive interventions against poaching and the wealth of other, habitat-related, threats facing Hog Deer. Currently the area of occupancy is far too high for listing as Endangered on this criterion, or even, probably, as Vulnerable.<br/><br/>During the mid and later decades of the twentieth century, the global population underwent rapid range-wide reductions, with the almost total loss of Hog Deer from Southeast Asia (when it was widespread and numerous in much of Cambodia, southern Viet Nam, lowland Thailand and probably plains Lao PDR) and massive declines in the Terai Arc Landscape subpopulations consequent upon the conquering of malaria and the influx of people to the area with wholesale habitat conversion and heavy hunting. Unquestionably at this time Hog Deer global population declines were at rates consistent with Endangered listing. By the mid 1980s (i.e., the start of the relevant period for a current A2 listing), subpopulations (at least those large enough to influence the overall global decline rate) had gone from Thailand and Bangladesh and, almost certainly, from Lao PDR, Viet Nam and China. It is likely that many Hog Deer remained in Cambodia, where subpopulations two to three decades ago may well have been in the thousands or even into the low tens of thousands, based on general perceptions of large-mammal abundance and relative wealth of suitable habitat (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008), and Myanmar, where Hog Deer was regarded as a widespread and common species of no conservation concern in the mid 1980s (various people per J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). In the interim, the Cambodian population has collapsed. Although there is a dearth of information on current status in Myanmar, there is no reason to assume that such a trend is not also in train there, although it may potentially be somewhat behind Cambodia. In sum, the rate of population decline in the last 21 years in the region comprising Cambodia, Viet Nam, Lao PDR, Thailand, China and Bangladesh has exceeded 90%, a continuation of such declines from the 1950s onwards.<br/><br/>Populations in India and Nepal - and perhaps Pakistan and Bhutan (no recent information traced) - have not declined at anything like such a rate in the last two decades. Declines in India are likely to have been more like 30–40% over the last 21 years, although this may be an underestimate (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008); even in high-profile protected areas such as Corbett Tiger Reserve, Jaldapara Wildlife Sanctuary and Dudhwa Tiger Reserve subpopulations are not secure. Declines have been at least 30% for Nepal (H.S. Baral pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>The trend in the population in Myanmar and its proportionate contribution to the overall global trend over the last three generations is the chief uncertainty. It was surely numerically large enough to have some influence on the global assessment of decline rate, given the abundance of prime habitat. Coupling the continued conversion of habitat to agriculture, the lack of protected areas specifically for the species (in contrast to those for Eld’s Deer), the uneven success of Eld’s Deer protected areas in conserving the species even with prioritised support and international collaboration, and the lack of awareness over the plight of grassland biodiversity in the country, as typified by current locations of protected areas, it is clear that whatever the surviving population of Hog Deer is in Myanmar, this is largely due to chance. In no other range state has chance resulted in the survival of large subpopulations: there has been almost regional extinction in the countries to the east of Myanmar, and a fast retraction to reasonably well-secured protected areas in the countries to the west. The current reality for Myanmar probably lies somewhere between these two, and, thus, subpopulations have probably declined by 40–60% or even more in the last three generations.<br/><br/>Combining these inferred regional decline rates, an overall global decline rate in the last 21 years of 50% is tenable. The Thai ‘wild-living’ subpopulation is re-introduced into artificially created habitats, and has not been used to influence the assessment; although it is within the species' native geographic range, it is possible that it is not the native subspecies. The Sri Lankan and Australian subpopulations, outside the native range, has not been used to influence the assessment (but seems to be declining anyway).<br/><br/>Hog Deer has not been listed as threatened prior to 2008. This was probably due in large part to a few large, high-density, South Asian subpopulations that give the appearance of ‘abundance’, but these are exceptional to its true status, of extinction across most of its former range and within much of its present range. This is not fully appreciated even at the present time, despite the analysis of Biswas and Mathur (2000) and subsequent work by Biswas across one of the two main range states (India).<br/><br/>In the six years since 2008, new subpopulations were found in Cambodia, but are probably not too small to have much influence on global population trends. However effective protection for any Cambodian subpopulations has failed to materialise, and declines in this short window have probably exceeded 90% driven by unprecedented economic development in Cambodia. The situation in Myanmar appears equally bleak, with similar current trends in exploitation of preferred habitats and weak protection measures, together with a lack of focus on the species (see also the 2014 assessment of Eld's Deer).<br/><br/>The situation in India and Nepal appears to be similar to that in 2008. A recent assessment on Northeast India, a major stronghold of the species found large local subpopulations still occur in Assam with sizeable numbers in northers West Bengal and Arunachal Pradesh (Choudhury 2013). There is a small but secured subpopulation in Manipur and scattered animals in other states of the region. However in Assam sharp declines have been recorded outside the protected areas such as in Lakhimpur and Dhemaji districts (Chodhury 2007).","Hog Deer is usually reported from habitat consisting of wet or moist tall grasslands, often associated with medium- to large-sized rivers (Bhowmik <em>et al</em>. 1999, Biswas and Mathur 2000, Biswas 2004), and appears to reach its highest densities in floodplain grasslands (Seidensticker 1976, Dhungel and O’Gara 1991, Karanth and Nichols 2000, Odden <em>et al</em>. 2005). It avoids closed-canopy forest, but will use coastal grasslands (e.g., Peacock 1933). Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. (2004) considered Hog Deer to be an obligate grassland species in the Terai Arc Landscape of India, and studies in India and Nepal have shown a preference for grasslands dominated by <em>Imperata cylindrica</em>&#160;(Biswas 2004 and references therein). Similar alluvial floodplain grassland seems to be used in Thailand and Indochina (Maxwell <em>et al</em>. 2007, Clark undated, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2006). In Bardia National Park, measured densities were much higher in the floodplain association than in the riverine association, and no Hog Deer was found in adjacent Sal <em>Shorea robusta</em> forest at all (Odden <em>et al</em>. 2005). In the hilly areas of northeastern India, it occurs in small grassy areas, light woodland and abandoned <em>juhms</em>&#160;with grass (Choudhury 2013, A. Choudhury pers. comm 2014). The highest elevation where it has been recorder was 1,500 m asl in Nagaland (Choudhury 2013). These seem to be marginal habitats supporting only low-density subpopulations (A.U. Choudhury pers. comm. 2006): they may historically have been primarily ‘sink’ subpopulations. The remnant population in Bangladesh is located in grassy, lightly wooded, hill country (Khan 2004). In the southwestern coastal lowlands of Cambodia, where apparently the species was once common (Dumas 1944), the species appears to use an open habitat mosaic including brackish <em>Eleocharis</em>&#160;sedge marshes and&#160;‘upland’ tall <em>Imperata cylindrica</em>&#160;grasslands, and areas of scrubby open secondary woodland interspersed with&#160;‘dry’ short stature grasslands; cane-grass floodplain grasslands are essentially absent in this region (Timmins and Sechres 2010, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). The reintroduced semi-wild subpopulations in Thailand occupy a variety of habitats for which there is no evidence of use by wild subpopulations in Thailand, Lao PDR, Viet Nam or Cambodia. One of the few detailed historical accounts of an abundant subpopulation in Southeast Asia was from extensive tall floodplain grasslands in the Dong Nai catchment, Viet Nam (Clark undated). Hog Deer is a primarily a grazer of young grasses, particularly <em>Imperata cylindrica</em> and <em>Saccharum</em> spp.; it also takes herbs, flowers, fruits and browse (young leaves and shoots of shrubs; Bhowmik <em>et al</em>. 1999, Dhungel and O’Gara 1991, Bisawas 2004, Wegge <em>et al</em>. 2006). It is much more a grazer and less a browser than is the Sambar <em>Rusa unicolor</em>. Animals occur in scrub and cinnamon gardens in Sri Lanka, where they cause considerable damage to home crops (McCarthy and Dissanayake 1992).<br/><br/>Where undisturbed, Hog Deer tend to be crepuscular, with significant day-time activity and some at night, especially in the hot and wet seasons (Dhungel and O’Gara 1991). In some areas it seems to have become more nocturnal and solitary (e.g., Cambodia; R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008), presumably through hunting pressure. The main social group is a female and fawn. When more Hog Deer are together, they do not form a strong ""unit"", fleeing when flushed in different directions rather than as one. In Chitwan, aggregations of up to 20 animals have been observed feeding on new shoots following fire (Dhungel and O’Gara 1991). In Kaziranga, aggregations of 40–80 animals are frequently seen on grazing grounds created by Great Indian Rhinoceros <em>Rhinoceros unicornis</em> and/or short grasslands near large water bodies (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008, based on observations in 1996). Home ranges vary widely in size, but average about five to 70 ha, depending on how the range is defined (Dhungel and O’Gara 1991, Odden <em>et al</em>. 2005). In Chitwan, Hog Deer is essentially sedentary (Dhungel and O’Gara 1991), but in cultivated landscapes (Sri Lanka) movements are reported to be influenced by agricultural seasons (McCarthy and Dissanayake 1992). Hog Deer moves into higher-lying grasslands in response to monsoon flooding in India, Myanmar and presumably throughout their range (Peacock 1933, Q. Qureshi pers. comm. 1995). The rut is during September–October in Nepal and India and (presumably based on captives) during September–February in China. One to two fawns are born during April–May in Nepal and during April–October in China. Gestation period is 220–230 days (Dhungel and O’Gara 1991, Sheng and Ohtaishi 1993). Fawns wean at six months, reaching sexual maturity at eight to 12 months. The maximum recorded life span is 20 years.","Hog Deer is threatened by hunting and by habitat loss and degradation; much prime Hog Deer habitat had probably been converted well before the 20th century (e.g., Peacock 1933). The balance between these threats and their current severity varies somewhat between ‘South Asia’ (here comprising India, Nepal, presumably Bhutan and perhaps Pakistan) and ‘Southeast Asia’ (here comprising China, Viet Nam, Lao PDR, Cambodia, Thailand and Bangladesh). In 2008 it was considered that there was insufficient information to judge for Myammar into which group it would fit however as of 2014 it is now clear that trends in habitats clearance, hunting pressure and conservation management in Myanmar are very similar to&#160;‘Southeast Asia’ especially Cambodia. Sri Lanka and Australia are considered outside the native range so not covered in detail here.<br/><br/>In the Mekong countries of Lao PDR, Cambodia, Thailand, Viet Nam and also probably China and Bangladesh, hunting has been, and remains, the primary direct threat to the species. In addition to local consumption of meat, the main factor presently driving such hunting is the thriving and probably increasing national, regional and East Asian markets trade in bushmeat, abetted by markets for traditional medicinal products derived from deer species and for trophy antlers (Tordoff <em>et al</em>. 2005, Maxwell <em>et al</em>. 2007). It is also possible that hunting could be stimulated by demand for captive animals, especially from zoos and menageries in Thailand and Cambodia (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008), although as of 2014 this is almost certainly insignificant (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). The species is apparently easy to hunt compared with other sympatric deer (e.g. Peacock 1933, Dumas 1944), and fawns are likely to be very vulnerable to dogs which almost always accompany human parties during excursions, however, brief, outside farm and residential land, even if these are not for hunting (Tordoff <em>et al</em>. 2005, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Hunting itself has been greatly augmented by habitat loss: the vast majority of tall floodplain grasslands have been lost in the region due to the suitability of such habitat for human settlement and agriculture, and only very small patches remain. This huge extent of habitat loss probably occurred largely after Hog Deer had been hunted down to negligible numbers (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). The coastal lowland open habitat mosaic of southwestern Cambodia in contrast remained extensive and relatively little changed even in 2008, however development pressure in the area has increased enormously in the intervening years, with considerable developments of agricultural and agroforestry plantations (Timmins and Sechrest 2010, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). Given these threats, which are ongoing, Hog Deer is one of the most threatened large mammals in Indochina (Timmins and Duckworth 2000, Tordoff <em>et al</em>. 2005, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). The most significant challenge to conserving the species there is the uncertainty involved with long term protected area-based conservation management. As of the end of 2014 there are still no specific conservation measures for the species in Cambodia; none of the known subpopulations occur substantially within a protected area and given hunting pressure and trends in habitat loss, these subpopulations are highly likely to be extirpated in the short to medium term (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014).<br/>Even in South Asia, where many protected areas are effective in conserving populations of large ungulates, Hog Deer declined precipitously in the 20th century through habitat loss and hunting. It is still in decline even within some protected areas (e.g. Bhowmik 2002; see below). In India, habitat loss to cultivation has greatly reduced the area available to Hog Deer, and has continued to do so outside protected areas even in recent decades (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. (2004) stated that high levels of malaria had previously discouraged settlement, agriculture, and thus habitat conversion in the Terai Arc Landscape, and that the conquering of malaria has made the Indian side of the Terai Arc Landscape ""one of the most densely populated regions of [India, with a] population growing at a much higher rate than the rest of [India]. Most of the fertile Terai plains have been taken over by agriculture"". Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. (2004) stated that controlling disturbance to Lagga Bagga forest block in Pilibhit Forest Division (now within a tiger reserve; B. Long pers. comm. 2008) is a huge challenge: many people rely on it for firewood, thatch grass and fodder, and that intensive protection and participatory management with these people are required to restore the area. Such a threat profile is typical of areas supporting Hog Deer. Outside protected areas, some Hog Deer remain in woodland areas where densities are very low, and although animals do appear to breed in such situations, it is unclear in the absence of adjacent high-density river plains populations how viable such woodland populations will be in the long term (A. Choudhury pers. comm. 2006). Protected areas are encroached for cultivation and even more so for livestock grazing, which is surely increasing pressure on Hog Deer along with many other species. As a grazing species, Hog Deer numbers are likely to be severely depressed by competition with domestic livestock (by analogy with other wild ruminants, as detailed by Madhusudan 2004), although no data were traced on this. Domestic stock are ubiquitous in all areas outside the protected area network and even occur in many within it, specifically at least: Chitwan; Orang; Jaldapara; and Gorumara (Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004, R.H. Emslie pers. comm., B.N. Talukdar pers. comm., S.S. Bist pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Most subpopulations in India are under severe threat from hunting (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008), although the largest subpopulation of the species, in Kaziranga, has been secured from this threat for many years. Poaching occurs in protected areas throughout the Indian range, especially in north Bengal, and can be associated with other human uses of protected areas perceived to be more legitimate, such as grazing camps (Biswas 2004). Many old skulls of Hog Deer were found across Arunachal Pradesh and Assam during the survey of Biswas <em>et al</em>. (2002). On average two to three skulls were recorded from most houses in villages randomly visited during the survey in Arunachal Pradesh. Regularly, shots were heard and machans (tree-houses made for poaching) were found during the surveys in Nameri National Park, Sonai-Rupai Wildlife Sanctuary and Namdapha Tiger Reserve. According to questionnaire, 52% of responses reported high incidence of Hog Deer hunting in neighbouring areas. Hunting was reported as the primary reason for the sudden decline of the Hog Deer population from north Bengal since 1877. Biswas <em>et al</em>. (2002) detailed evidence of Hog Deer hunting during the survey and past records from the district of Cooch Behar (West Bengal) back to the 18th century. Even today, in high-profile areas such a Corbett Tiger Reserve and Rajaji National Park, there are still instances of deer poaching, and poaching has seriously depleted abundance of large mammals in most of the Terai Arc Landscape. Some poaching is driven by a desire to seek adventure, the thrill of shikar and wild meat, some by crushing poverty of daily wage labourers and others, some to take advantage of the business opportunity of supplying a lucrative trade. Poaching is done with dogs, snares, spears and guns (Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004). Outside protected areas in India, enforcement of anti-hunting regulations is patchy and, unless there is effective specific intervention, all Hog Deer subpopulations in such areas will become extirpated in the near future from hunting (A. Choudhury pers. comm. 2006, N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). Hog Deer avidly eats rice and so in the past was “destroyed ruthlessly on such grounds” (Peacock 1933). It seems unlikely that killing Hog Deer solely for reduction of crop damage is nowadays a reason for population decline, although it may be a convenient excuse to kill deer. Most serious is that the predilection of Hog Deer to eat rice is likely to bring them into closer contact with people and therefore to increase easy opportunities for hunting. In Kratie, Cambodia, Hog Deer occur near, and seasonally forage in, rice fields, especially in the early rainy season. People set traps for wild pigs <em>Sus</em> species, which are more abundant than Hog Deer, and the traps sometimes kill Hog Deer. The local people now are reportedly refraining from using indiscriminate traps in the Hog Deer area, but such cooperation is unlikely to continue forever, because crop predation by pigs is really a problem (A. Maxwell pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>In today’s highly fragmented subpopulations which have limited dispersal possibility, flooding may take heavy tolls, especially in the Brahmaputra flood plain (Q. Qureshi pers. comm. 1995). In Kaziranga National Park, where the largest subpopulation of this species is found, flooding is likely to be a major threat: in 1998 the flood reduced the subpopulation to less than half its pre-flood number (A. Choudhury pers. comm. 2006). High floods both lead to drowning as animals are washed away also falling victim to road kill (A. Choudhury pers. comm. 2014). The situation is similar in Nepal where Hog Deer appears to be especially vulnerable because of the short-grass habitats it usually uses during flood season, and in protected area like Koshi Tappu, flooding probably causes wide fluctuations in population numbers (H.S. Baral pers. comm. 2008). Hog Deer subpopulations appear to rebound quickly even from heavy losses, but the fragmentation and increasing isolation of subpopulations into small areas, sometimes with no linkage to suitable higher ground, makes periodic losses from flooding a high risk for future site-level extinctions. Flooding is also a danger because, except in areas of effective anti-poaching activity, by marooning Hog Deer on little patches of high ground it makes them more easy to hunt (Peacock 1933).<br/><br/>A further threat also reflects the colossal habitat fragmentation in recent centuries. Prime Hog Deer habitats are naturally dynamic, and on a living floodplain new areas of grasslands are constantly created through natural processes to replace those changing through natural succession to woody vegetation; creation occurs through traumatic change of floodplain stream and land layout during spates (Dinerstein 1979, Lehmkuhl 1994, Peet <em>et al</em>. 1999). This is incompatible with farming and other human land-uses, which seek a predictable landscape. Hence, within Hog Deer range, there are very few active natural floodplains in which pre-exploitation processes shape the landscape in this way. Thus, the grasslands which are the prime habitat of Hog Deer generally require active management. In some protected areas grasslands are being lost by succession of wooded habitats, for example Chitwan (A. Choudhury pers. comm. 2006) and Bardia (Odden <em>et al</em>. 2005). By contrast, annual burning in Kaziranga, while maintaining a grass habitat, has rapidly changed the grassland structure and composition and how this change affects Hog Deer subpopulations is not known (S. Deb Roy pers. comm. 1996). In Nepal there is also succession of different grassland types and in particular <em>Imperata cylindrica</em> grasslands, which Hog Deer appears to favour at certain times of the year (Biswas 2004), are being replaced by larger cane grasses (H. S. Baral pers. comm. 2008). Locally, conservation management of grasslands to benefit rhinoceroses, for instance in Jaldapara, might negatively affect Hog Deer (Biswas 2004 and references within).<br/><br/>The invasive creeper <em>Mikania</em> sp. threatens Hog Deer’s favoured grasslands both within and outside protected areas, and after flooding and poaching is possibly the next most serious threat to the species in Nepal (H.S. Baral pers. comm. 2008). In combination with invasion by <em>Chromolaena odorata</em> (=<em>Eupatorium odoratum</em>), heavy livestock grazing pressure and invasion of some grasslands by <em>Acacia catechu</em> and <em>Dalbergia sissou</em>, the grassland area in Chitwan has been reduced from 20% to 4.7% of the national park (R.H. Emslie pers. comm.). <em>Mikania</em> sp. are also carpeting large areas of non-forest habitats in the Hukaung Valley, Myanmar (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). <em>Lantana camara</em> is also displacing native plants widely, and in Dudhwa Tiger Reserve, the creeper <em>Tiliacora acuminata</em> is proliferating across Hog Deer habitat (Kumar <em>et al</em>. 2002, Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004, N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). In Assam an invasive <em>Mimosa</em> sp. threatens the habitat in sites like Kaziranga and Orang National Parks, whereas in Manas National Park an invasive <em>Lea</em> sp. has become a major threat to the grassland habitat of the hog deer (B. Talukdar pers. comm. 2008). <br/><br/>Floodplain grasslands are strongly affected in their pace of natural succession by water flows and levels, and seasonal patterns in them. Hydropower development changes these parameters and thus threatens habitat, including a project under consideration across the Mekong which would affect the sole known subpopulation of <em>A. p. annamiticus</em> (that in Cambodia), and another across the Karnali river which would modify habitats in Bardia, Nepal (Odden <em>et al</em>. 2005). There have been proposals to dam the Brahmaputra River in Arunachal Pradesh, and should this happen, this could very negatively affect the habitat quality and Hog Deer carrying capacity of major parks like Kaziranga in future (by preventing or reducing the pulse of nutrients brought in by regular large floods, as well as changes in water levels and flows). In Jaldapara Sanctuary, the River Torsa no longer overflows as a result of massive flood-control structures. As a result the water table in the sanctuary is receding and the natural water-bodies and wallow-pools are slowly drying up (S.S. Bist pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Disease epidemics spreading from domestic livestock presumably pose a threat, especially given the close overlap of Hog Deer and domestic livestock in South Asia, the high densities especially of the latter, and the small and localised nature of Hog Deer subpopulations.<br/><br/>In Sri Lanka the continued survival of the introduced subpopulations depends on controlling hunting and maintaining traditional agricultural land use practices. The land is too intensively cultivated for the establishment of protected areas within the range of the species. Threats in the rest of the introduced range are not reviewed here.","<em style=""font-weight: bold;"">Pakistan</em><br/>Hog Deer is confined to isolated riverine grasslands along the Indus valley and its upper tributaries, mostly in the Indus River forest reserves of Sind Province, with small subpopulations around the Indus mouth and to the north of Sukkur (Roberts 1977). The species was listed for the protected areas of Chashma Lake Wildlife Sanctuary, Head Islam/Chak Kotora Game Reserve (greatly reduced in number), Lal Suhanra National Park (reintroduced), Taunsa Barrage Wildlife Sanctuary, and possibly Rasool Barrage Wildlife Sanctuary (WCMC 1992), but no information more recent than Whale (1996) has been traced.<br/><br/><em style=""font-weight: bold;"">India</em><br/>Hog Deer is found mainly in the Terai grasslands along the Himalayan foothills and the flood-plains of the Rivers Ganges and Brahmaputra, from Punjab in the west to Arunachal Pradesh in the east (Tandon 1989, Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004, Biswas 2004). Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. (2004), who made extensive surveys of the Terai Arc Landscape of India (for Tiger,&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Panthera tigris,</span>&#160;and various prey species), considered that Dudhwa Tiger Reserve is excellent habitat for Hog Deer; that there was a reasonable subpopulation in Pilhibit Forest Division, particularly the Lagga Bagga forest block (now within a Tiger reserve; B. Long pers. comm. 2008); that Kishanpur Wildife Sanctuary (203 km<sup>2</sup>), with one of the few remnants of Terai habitat in India, supported considerable numbers, and that Katarniaghat Wildife Division also held Hog Deer. Assessments conducted specifically for Hog Deer by Biswas <em>et al</em>. (2002; see also Biswas 2004) for India surmised that populations remained in 29–34 areas, with significant numbers only in the following: Arunachal Pradesh: 100–200 in D’ering, and 20–50 in Namdapha; Assam: 20–50 in Dibrusaikhowa, over 1,000 in Kaziranga (but see below), over 1,000 in Manas, 20–50 in Nameiri, 200–500 in Orang, 20–50 in Kobuchapori, 20–50 in Burachapori, and 20–50 in Sunai Rupa; Bihar: 100–200 in Valmiki; Uttrakand (= Uttaranchal): 200–500 in Corbett Tiger Reserve (but see below); Uttar Pradesh: 1,000–2,000 in Dudhwa, 20–50 in Katarniaghat, 100–200 in Kishanpur, and 20–50 in North Kheri Forest Division; and West Bengal: 100–200 in Gorumara and a population at Jaldapara. Their estimate for Pilhibit Forest Division was zero, <em>contra</em> Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. (2004). Biswas’s study also considered that Hog Deer had been lost from 35 historically known localities, and suggested it was ‘endangered’, with citations given for alarming decline even prior to the mid 1970s (Biswas 2004). The figures were not derived from rigorous sampling and some will surely need revision. Particularly, it is certain that there are over 10,000 Hog Deer in Kaziranga, with a best estimate of 14,000–16,000, at ecological densities of 38.6 (with SE 3.45) animals per km<sup>2</sup> (Karanth and Nicholls 2000, N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008); and in Corbett Tiger Reserve, only about 100 were reported in 2008 by Bivash Pandav (pers. comm. 2008) and while the actual number is unclear, densities are now very low, even in prime habitat (K.M. Chinnappa and Praveen per N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008), and a rapid decline is in place (A. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). Dudhwa Tiger Reserve also faces a suite of conservation problems meaning that population status of Hog Deer there is unlikely to be as healthy as in Kaziranga: poaching is rampant, and the creeper <em>Tiliacora acuminata</em>&#160;is proliferating across Hog Deer habitat (Kumar <em>et al</em>. 2002, Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004, N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). At Jaldapara Wildlife Sanctuary, where Biswas (1999) studied ecology of Hog Deer in the 1990s, sightings, and presumably populations, have now drastically declined (A.J.T. Johnsingh pers. comm. 2008). Hog Deer is now primarily restricted to protected areas (A. Choudhury pers. comm. 2006), but south of Rajaji National Park there are a few isolated groups along the river (perhaps totalling about 100 animals); these are outside protected areas (B. Pandav pers. comm. 2008). All such subpopulations outside protected areas are in very rapid decline (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). The presence of this species in Manipur and southern Assam (close to Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura) is based on records in Biswas <em>et al</em>. (2002); its current status there is unknown. All groups in these areas were estimated to be very small, and should not be assumed to persist. The more recent assessment by Choudhury (2013) indicated the following numbers in some key northeastern Indian reserves: Kaziranga (c. 10,000; marginal decline owing to high floods), Manas (c. 1,500; marginal increase since near extirpation in the 1989-1992 period), RG Orang (c. 500; all in Assam); Jaldapara (250+; marginal increase in recent years owing to improved protection, in Arunachal Pradesh); and Keibul Lamjao (c. 100) (in Manipur).<br/><br/><em style=""font-weight: bold;"">Bangladesh</em><br/>Hog Deer has disappeared from the Sundarbans (Salter 1984) and has not been reported from the Sylhet District, in the northeast, since the 1970s (Khan 2004). After a long period with no records, an animal was trapped by local people in 2002 (Khan 2004). Further surveys suggested that a few Hog Deer remained in the Chittagong Hill Tracts of the southeast (Khan 2004, Md Anwarul Islam pers. comm. 2008). Camera trapping and observational surveys during 2010-2011 in Chittagong Hill Tracts did not detect Hog Deer, however the surveys did not cover the low hills and degraded forest areas in which the species would most likely be expected to occur (S. Chakma per.comm. 2014). There is a small captive population derived from native animals (Md Anwarul Islam pers. comm. 2008). Within historic times, Hog Deer was never widespread in the country and pressure was on it from at least the 1970s (Md Anwarul Islam pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/><em style=""font-weight: bold;"">Nepal</em><br/>Hog Deer is locally abundant in the Terai, but is now restricted largely, if not entirely, to protected areas (P. Yonzon pers. comm. 2006, H.S. Baral pers. comm. 2008). Although subpopulations may currently be relatively stable, declines in the past 20–30 years are likely to have exceeded 30% (H.S. Baral pers. comm. 2008). Measured densities range from 0.1 per km<sup>2</sup> in riverine forest, to 16.5 per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in savanna, and 35 per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in grassland flood-plains (Seidensticker 1976, Dhungel and O’Gara 1991). In Bardia National Park, densities of 77.3 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in the floodplain association and 5.8 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in the riverine association (and zero in Sal forest) were measured (Odden <em>et al</em>. 2005). The species occurs in the following protected areas: Parsa Wildlife Reserve (with a very small subpopulation), Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve, Bardia National Park, Chitwan National Park, and Sukla Phanta Wildlife Reserve (Hem Sagar Baral pers. comm. 2008). Each of Suklaphanta, Bardia and Chitwan supports hundreds of Hog Deer. As of 2014, there has been no significant change in the population since 2008 (H.S. Baral pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/><em style=""font-weight: bold;"">Bhutan</em><br/>The small Bhutan subpopulation is found mostly along the southern foothills and small plains along the rivers. Animals have been observed in three protected areas along its border with Assam India, these are Phipsoo, Royal Manas and Khaling. The number of individuals in Royal Manas National Park could be greater than 150, with the grassland around the Gabhorukunda river as the main stronghold (A. Choudhury, pers. comm 2014). It has also been recorder from Mochu Wildlife Reserve.<br/><br/><em style=""font-weight: bold;"">China</em><br/>Hog Deer historically was recorded in southwest parts of Gengma and Cangyuan counties of Western Yunnan bordering Myanmar, and has recently been stated to be extinct in the country (Ohtaishi and Gao 1990, Smith and Xie Yan 2008).<br/><br/><em style=""font-weight: bold;"">Myanmar</em><br/>Hog Deer has long been known in Myanmar (e.g., Evans 1902) and occurred throughout the country wherever there were grassy plains (Peacock 1933). For the 2008 assessment detailed information on Hog Deer's current range or population status in Myanmar has not been traced. It was already in major decline by the time Peacock (1933) wrote. It was listed only for three protected areas by WCMC (1992): Pidaung, Kahilu, and Hlawga Wildlife Reserves. Of these, the Hlawga subpopulation of many dozen (in 2007) is a semi-captive, managed herd: the entire area, of several square kilometres, is fenced; however, it may be ‘native’ in that the founders were reputedly from animals captured locally during the 1980s (Saw Htoo Tha Po verbally 2007 to J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008)., but these have been added to over the years (T. Zaw pers. comm. 2014). As of 2014, there were still small numbers at Hlawga, but they appeared to be decreasing because of new management at the park and possibly hunting (T. Zaw pers. comm. 2014). The Pidaung Wildlife Sanctuary was set aside in 1918 to protect an unusual mix of evergreen forest and savanna-like ecosystems (Milton <em>et al</em>. 1964), and Hog Deer used to be very numerous within it (Peacock 1933); at this time it was the only site in the country where Hog Deer received a measure of protection. Today, the presence of permanent human settlements, roads and railway lines, plantations of sugar cane, military camps and permanent cultivation have completely altered large portions of the sanctuary, and an insignificant area of the original ecosystem remains (Rao <em>et al</em>. 2002). These land-uses are concentrated in the plains parts of the sanctuary, where Hog Deer used to live, and have converted so absolutely these areas that it is not obvious to someone driving along the road when the protected area is entered or exited (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008, based on visits in 2005-2006). People and dogs are ubiquitous and it seems implausible that any Hog Deer could survive here (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008, based on visits in 2005–2006). However park staff believe that a few animals still persist there (T. Zaw pers. comm. 2014). In 2010 and 2011 Hog Deer was confirmed by camera-trapping from Hukaung Valley in Kachin state (T. Zaw pers. comm. 2014), following on from reports from hunters' and conservation staff between 2005-2007 (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). At the turn of the century suitable habitat was very extensive in the Hukaung Valley, but as of 2014 review of remote imagery suggests that there has been massive loss of riparian grasslands to make way for agriculture and other anthropogenic land uses (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). Hog deer are still present in a fairly large area of floodplain grasslands including areas along the Tanai (Upper Chindwin), Tawan and Mogaung streams. Much of the grasslands where hog deer area known are outside of the Wildlife Sanctuary but as awareness of the species is increasing, it appears they occur further inside the Wildlife Sanctuary than previously thought (R. Tizard pers. comm. 2014). An FFI survey team recorded Hog Deer in the grasslands between the boundary of Indawgyi WS and the forest in 2012 (T. Zaw pers. comm. 2014). Several government staff indicated in 2005-2007 that the species is still locally common in lowland Myanmar (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). Pidaung was seen as a flagship protected area (it was one of the country’s first), and its current status does not augur well for the few other protected areas which contain suitable Hog Deer habitat. Extensive camera-trapping for a Tiger survey found no evidence of the species (Lynam 2003), but this may simply have reflected the focus of the survey on closed evergreen forests (habitats unsuitable for Hog Deer), as various other species known to be common but not using closed evergreen forest were also camera-trapped rarely if at all (T. Zaw <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/><em style=""font-weight: bold;"">Thailand</em><br/>The species was formerly abundant in the Chao Phraya Basin during the early 20th century, but had become extinct there by the mid-1960s (Humphrey and Bain 1990). There was formerly a huge export trade, for example 20,000 skins went out of the Gulf of Siam (it is not stated whether this was from Thailand, Cambodia, or both) in 1930–1931 (Dumas 1944). There was a plea for conservation attention to the species in Thailand in Lekagul and McNeely (1977), but this seems to have come too late. Animals reportedly from Thailand and possibly Myanmar have been used to build up numerous managed herds in captive and semi-wild conditions across the country, although the origins of the managed herds remain uncertain. Such animals were introduced into Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary and Propagation Station in northern Thailand in the early 1990s, at a higher elevation than is typical for the natural range of the species; this herd lives in open grassland around the edge of a reservoir (A. Pattanavibool pers. comm. 2006, R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2006). There is also an apparently large introduced subpopulation on the island of Ko Chang in the Gulf of Siam.<br/><br/><em style=""font-weight: bold;"">Lao PDR</em><br/>Hog Deer is probably extinct in Lao PDR and its past status is difficult to assess: there are few, if any, specimens held in international collections from the country, and there were no records (except of old trophies) during extensive surveys across the country in the 1990s (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999). However, Osgood (1932) specifically cautioned that it was much under-represented in zoological collections, despite it being locally common in Indochina. The extent to which this statement includes Lao PDR is unknown. All potentially suitable habitat patches are now small in size and are heavily used by local people, hunting pressure in Lao PDR is high, and it is inconceivable in the great majority of areas that any Hog Deer could still persist (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, 2014). <br/><br/><em style=""font-weight: bold;"">Viet Nam</em><br/>Hog Deer is thought to be extinct in Viet Nam, having previously occurred in some large subpopulations in suitable habitat (e.g. Clark undated) and apparently having been widespread in the south according to reports in Ratajszczak (1991). This reflects the rapidity with which suitable habitat has been lost and the heavy hunting pressure on large mammals throughout much of Viet Nam (Tordoff <em>et al</em>. 2005, Timmins and Duckworth 2000). If the species still occurs in Viet Nam, it is most likely to be along the Kon river in Kon Cha Rang Nature Reserve, the western Srepok river lowlands of Dak Lak Province, the Sa Tay area of Kon Tum and Gia Lai Provinces, the Dong Nai river lowlands and Lam Dong Province (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). However, there is no recent evidence other than unconfirmed reports, and a trophy which may be of Hog Deer from the Kon Cha Rang NR area. Other evidence, notably high hunting rates of ungulates in general, suggest that even very small numbers are unlikely to survive (Dang Huy Huynh 1986, Tordoff <em>et al</em>. 2005, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2006, 2014).<br/><br/><em style=""font-weight: bold;"">Cambodia</em><br/>Hog Deer used to be abundant on the vast marshy plains of Cambodia, such as around Sre Ambel, in the province of Kratie, around Kompong Som, and around Kampot; in the drier regions of much of the north it was not common (Dumas 1944). Increased wildlife surveys from 1994 onwards failed to find Hog Deer anywhere in Cambodia until it was re-found in Kratie in 2006, following concerns it might already be extinct (Tordoff <em>et al</em>. 2005, Maxwell <em>et al</em>. 2007). A few animals, probably in the low dozens, remain scattered in small groups in remnant areas of floodplain grasslands and other vegetation in Kratie Province (Maxwell <em>et al</em>. 2007, Bezuijen <em>et al</em>. 2008.). In 2008 the species was detected in grasslands and remained widespread (Timmins and Sechrest 2010). Potential habitat in the southwest was much greater in extent than in the Kratie floodplains suggesting that a much larger subpopulation of deer remained there at least at the turn of the century (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014) and the species was recorded from three additional sites in 2013 during focused surveys for the species (Brook <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). Since 2008 however there has been no effective protection of any of the known subpopulations or of other areas of habitat with good potential for persistence; and coastal areas have in the intervening six years seen high rates of conversion especially to plantation agriculture and forestry (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). All remaining subpopulations are likely to be small, possibly isolated from each other, and subject to hunting (Brook <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><em style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></em><em style=""font-weight: bold;"">Sri Lanka</em> (probably introduced)<br/>Hog Deer is restricted to largely cultivated landscapes within a 35 km<sup>2</sup> area, between Ambalangoda and Indurawa on the southwest coast, and inland as far as Elpitiya (McCarthy and Dissanayake 1992, 1994). It does not occur in any protected area. Hog Deer is thought to have been introduced to Sri Lanka by the Dutch or the Portuguese in the 16th century, or possibly by a Sinhalese ruler in the pre-colonial period or the British later on; suggestions that it is native are doubted because of the absence of records across central and southern India (Biswas and Mathur 2000). Vishvanath <em>et al.</em>&#160;(2014) recommend genetic studies to further clarify the status of Sri Lanka's Hog Deer subpopulation.<br/><br/><strong><em>Australia</em>&#160;</strong>(introduced)<br/>All extant subpopulations of Hog Deer are on the South Coast of Victoria. There are two managed subpopulations at reserves on Sunday Island and at Blond Bay. Additionally, there are scattered groups on private land between Wilson's Promontory and Orbost. These subpopulations derive from releases made in 1865 (Scroggie <em>et al.</em>&#160;2012).",Decreasing,"Hog Deer historically occurred from Pakistan, throughout northern and northeastern India, including the Himalayan foothill zone, east across non-Sundaic Southeast Asia and, marginally, southern China (southern Yunnan province), but it is now reduced to isolated subpopulations within this range. It is almost extirpated from east of Myanmar. It is extinct in Thailand (where it has, however, been reintroduced) and almost certainly in Viet Nam and Lao PDR (Humphrey and Bain 1990, Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Tordoff <em>et al</em>. 2005, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Very small numbers have been found recently in Bangladesh and in five areas in Cambodia (Khan 2004, Maxwell <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2007, Timmings and Sechrest 2010, Brook <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). A report on the internet in 2007 from China turned out to refer to a young Sambar (B.P.L. Chan pers. comm. 2012).  Hog Deer still probably occurs in at least several areas of Myanmar (J.W. Duckworth <em>in litt</em>. 2008, from various sources), and localised subpopulations survive in northern and northeastern India, Nepal, Bhutan (few recent data) and Pakistan (status uncertain; Biswas and Mathur 2000, Biswas 2004). Hog Deer has been introduced (not mapped) into Australia (specifically the coastal regions of south and east Gippsland; Moore and Mayze 1990), the United States (Texas, Florida and Hawaii; Grubb 2005) and it is presumed introduced into Sri Lanka; however there remains some discussion as to whether the species is native or introduced into Sri Lanka (Vishvanath <em>et al</em>. 2014) so the species is retained here as non-native until definitive information is received.","Hog Deer is hunted in various parts of its range. It is hunted for its meat (bushmeat trade), traditional  medicinal products and for trophy antlers. It is also  possible that hunting could be stimulated by demand for captive  animals.",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Hog Deer is fully protected in Bangladesh, India, and probably most or all other range states. One subspecies is listed on CITES Appendix I as<em> Axis porcinus annamiticus</em><em></em>.<br/><br/>Wetlands, especially floodplain grasslands, have traditionally been ignored by the protected area systems and other conservation initiatives of Lao PDR, Viet Nam and Cambodia (Tordoff <em>et al</em>. 2005, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2006). Most of the area supporting the single known subpopulation in Cambodia has been proposed for protected area status, but the situation is complicated by the inclusion of agricultural lands and traditional use areas of local people, and the high human population immediately nearby (Maxwell <em>et al</em>. 2007, Bezuijen <em>et al</em>. 2008); as of 2014 no protected status has been granted to this area (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). As soon as the subpopulation was found, a small conservation programme with external funding from WWF was started to support a small number of forestry rangers and local guardians to carry out patrolling and community outreach activities, in addition to basic research. These measures ceased due to a combination of factors including lack of funding and motivation in part brought on by the failure to establish the site as as protected area in c. 2008 (R.J. Timmins pers. comm 2014), but may be re-established by WWF with the Forestry Administration (Brook <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). Probably the bulk of the southwest Cambodian subpopulation lies outside of protected areas, although there was marginal inclusion within one protected area Botum Sakor National Park and the proposed Southwest Elephant Corridor, with confirmed occurrence near to the Dong Peng Multiple Use Area. However, in all of these areas deer are in peripheral areas, while conservation attention, is focused on extensive forest at their heart (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>In 2013 a national action plan was developed for the conservation of Hog Deer in Indochina. The plan recommends securing the Kratie subpopulation and one of the Southwest subpopulations (Andoung Teuk) thourgh establishing anti-poaching patrols, engaging local communities in the conservation oh Hog Deer, stabilizing land-use and formalizing protection for the sites. It also recommends the establishment of a conservation breeding programme for the species from ideally to other known small and isolated subpopulations in the Southwest (Forestry Administration, 2014). The plan has not yet been approved by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. To ensure protection and survival of animals, consideration should be given as to whether it would be useful for part of the areas to be strategically fenced to help deter poaching, agricultural encroachment and predation by dogs; but this would need to consider seasonal movements.<br/><br/>There are few areas in Viet Nam where suitable habitat is thought to remain, but if reasonable extents of alluvial grassland survive in the following areas surveys for Hog Deer may be warranted: Cat Tien National Park, the Kon river in the Kon Cha Rang Nature Reserve area, and the Sa Tay area of Kon Tum and Gia Lai Provinces; although given the high hunting pressure in Viet Nam it is becoming very unlikely that any animals could still survive (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). Cat Tien National Park retains significant areas of alluvial grasslands, and could potentially in the future become a site for reintroduction, however park management appears to be to some extent ignorant of the importance of these grasslands with ongoing schemes to re-establish forest and a fire management policy that is probably leading to woody encroachment of grasslands (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014, based on a visit in December 2013).<br/><br/>It is not certain what conservation measures are in place (if any) for the rediscovered subpopulation in Bangladesh.<br/><br/>There has been no comprehensive assessment of Hog Deer in Myanmar, but it probably exists mostly in unprotected plains grassland areas which, as in the Mekong countries, are conventionally seen as of low conservation value (Peacock 1933, J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2006). In 2010 an 11,000 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;extension of the Hukaung valley was established. Hog Deer were camera-trapped in three localities in the grasslands along the Tawang River; one in the core area and the other two on the edge of the core area and the extension. In the last two years (since 2012) this area has seen the development of human settlements and agricultural expansion (Than Zaw pers. comm.) resulting in considerable loss of grassland habitat (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). A clarification of the status of Hog Deer in Myanmar is urgent: there may yet remain areas supporting animals which have high conservation potential if they do not disappear before being known to conservation. This lack of conservation profile is the chief challenge to Hog Deer in Myanmar at the moment, as it was in Peacock’s (1933) day: “the butchery of these little deer and the failure to provide more than one small sanctuary for their preservation is certainly one of the weak spots in Myanmar game legislation...the existing legislation is singularly ineffective in preventing their wholesale destruction. Moreover, there are few forest reserves which are suitable for the Hog Deer, and the legislation concerned with such forests is little more than a gesture”. If not met head-on, there are no grounds to assume that Hog Deer national conservation status will not replicate that shown by all range states to the east (major population collapse), if indeed it has not already done so.<br/><br/>Most Hog Deer subpopulations remaining in India, Nepal and Bhutan are in protected areas where animals are at least somewhat, and in some cases well, protected from poaching (Biswas <em>et al</em>. 2002, Biswas 2004, Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004, Pralad Yonzon pers. comm. 2006, H. S. Baral pers. comm. 2008, A. Choudhury pers. comm. 2006, N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). Wildlife protection laws in India have also helped in retaining the specialized habitat of Hog Deer, arresting habitat loss and habitat conversion in some protected areas. Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. (2004) found a strong correlation with Hog Deer subpopulations and protected areas in the Terai Arc Landscape of India (similar to that for Barasingha <em>Rucervus duvaucelii</em>), in contrast to other deer which occur relatively widely outside protected areas. Some protected areas are not big enough to allow adequate ranging during heavy flood periods, and thus prevent heavy mortality during such periods, and all suffer from being too small to be allowed unfettered habitat succession, because new grasslands are not now being created by natural processes elsewhere (see Habitat and ecology). In India and Nepal, Hog Deer has benefited from conservation measures taken for Great Indian Rhinoceros and Barasingha in the same wet grassland habitats (Q. Qureshi pers. comm. 1995, Biswas 2004). However, grassland management for rhinoceros may in some cases be deleterious to Hog Deer (Biswas 2004).<br/><br/>In South Asia there is an urgent need to update the status review of Biswas and Mathur (2000), even though some large Hog Deer subpopulations inhabit some of the best-secured protected areas in the world. Even assuming that these protected areas continue to receive sufficient material and political support, such a review is necessary because all subpopulations face uncertain futures from a multitude of factors, some of which originate outside protected areas and beyond the zone of influence of protected area managers. The review needs to determine roughly the numbers remaining and the locations of all sizeable or potentially sizeable subpopulations, and especially for each make assessments of current and likely future conservation status and population trends, bearing in mind threats from poaching, agricultural encroachment, livestock grazing, natural habitat succession, perverse habitat management, invasive plant species, the risk of disease epidemics from domestic livestock, changes to water levels and flows (e.g. from upstream dams), further fragmentation of subpopulations and habitats, episodic mortality through flooding and abiotic risks such as insurgency (which can collapse protected area management, although it does not always do so). Confinement of subpopulations to small habitat patches isolated from other such patches raises the intrinsic threat of subpopulation loss significantly when considering the wide gamut of threats facing such subpopulations (Biswas and Singh 2002, Biswas 2004), and in some sites challenges may be so pervasive that long-term retention of Hog Deer subpopulations may be so difficult as to be an inefficient use of resources. An integrated South Asia-wide conservation plan may be the best route to direct resources to a representative set of areas where long-term persistence of large Hog Deer subpopulations can be assured provided sufficient resources are mobilised and deployed in the appropriate way. <br/><br/>By contrast, in Southeast Asia, any subpopulation found east of central Thailand (i.e. within the historical range of <em>A. p. annamiticus</em>, the western limit of which is not clear) warrants immediate attention. It is plausible that the recently found small and fragile subpopulation in Cambodia is the last stock of this taxon. The isolated small subpopulations in Bangladesh, although presumably of the nominate race, warrant priority protection in maintaining the ancestral geographic and habitat range of Hog Deer.  Species-specific intervention in Myanmar should probably, given the great challenges in the country (and, specifically, the uneven success to date with Eld’s Deer <em>Rucervus eldii</em> conservation), be fitted within larger initiatives such as conservation of the Hukaung Valley, probably the largest floodplain in tropical Asia retaining largely natural ecological processes of stream geography and habitat dynamics.<br/><br/>In Sri Lanka, where the species is restricted to privately-owned gardens, its survival depends on the goodwill of the landowners. The conservation value of this introduced subpopulation needs re-evaluation, considering approximate size, recent trend, ecological integrity and any genetic uniqueness, balanced against the likely cost of conservation interventions to secure the subpopulation’s future. Needs of other introduced subpopulations are not considered here.<br/><br/>There is a large total of animals in zoos of tropical Asia. Although at least one Mekong animal appeared in a zoo recently (in Cambodia in the mid 1990s, C.M. Poole pers. comm. 1998), so far as is known, all captive herds are derived from subpopulations from Thailand and Myanmar and further west. Reintroduction of animals in the range of the nominate, should it be needed, thus has many options. There is no captive buffer for <em>A. p. annamiticus</em>.",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

This is based on an inferred population decline as a result of habitat loss, which may have approached 20-25% over the last ten years. Habitat conversion to agriculture and cattle farming, and hunting and persecution by feral dogs are constant threats, and the species is confined to a human dominated landscape with only patches of remaining habitat. The former Pampas Deer range has been dramatically reduced from 95 to 99% of the original habitat in the last century. Today less than 1% of the habitat remains (González<em> </em>1993, 1996). Although the Pampas Deer is adaptable to some degree of habitat modification, it should be monitored to ensure rates of decline do not increase. Habitat fragmentation is a serious threat to the existing population (González 2004, González <em>et al.</em> 2010).","The species occupies a range of open habitats in the Neotropics, in particular grassland areas and the cerrado shrublands. In Argentina, it also occurs in coastal salt marshes.","Habitat conversion for agriculture and competition with domestic livestock have been reported as threats to the Pampas Deer (Wemmer 1998). Due to the fragmentation of the remaining habitat the small and isolated populations face other threats. Other threats include over-exploitation for food, hides, and sport, predation by feral dogs, and possibly bovine disease (Wemmer 1998). In Brazil in Paraná State, another cause of mortality, outside of the Conservation Units, is the juvenile and fawn mortality during the crop harvest (Braga 2004). Predation of fawns by feral pigs occurs in both San Luis and the Bahia Samborombon; and fawns are kept as pets by local people (J. Jackson pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Breeding of cattle and sheep is also signaled as one of the negative factors for the species, due to competition for food and habitat, or transmission of diseases (Jackson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1980, Cosse <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009, Giménez Dixon 1987). However, there are situations where agricultural activity is compatible with the conservation of the Pampas Deer (Merino <em><em>et al.</em></em>&#160;2011). The presence of dogs related with the cattle activities and, even more, of feral dogs that attack the deer is a serious threat (Jackson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1980, Beade <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2000).","There is not update information of total population size there are partial estimation for population specifically in the Southern part of South America<em>.</em> The populations from Argentina and Uruguay show a declining trend (González <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2002, González <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010). A minimum estimate for the total population size is 20,000 (Pinder 1994), while the maximum population size is estimated at 80,000 (Pinder 1994) individuals.<br/><br/>The largest extant populations are found in Brazil, in the northeast cerrado ecosystem where about 2,000 individuals live, and in the Pantanal where 20,000 to 40,000 exist (Pinder 1994). While in the last years two subpopulations were discovered, one further north on the island of Marajo, at the mouth of the Amazon River (Rossetti and de Toledo 2006), extending the species range, and the other in the south of the country a small subpopulation in Paraná State estimated to be less than 100 individuals (Braga <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005). <br/><br/>In Uruguay there are two main subpopulations: El Tapado (Salto Department) with 800 individuals, and Los Ajos (Rocha Department) with approximately 300 deer (Weber and González 2003). At the turn of the 20th century, the Argentinean population was likely very large since over 500,000 km² of grassland habitat was available. However, today only three small subpopulations remain: Corrientes (Ituzaingo Department) with about 170 individuals (Merino and Beccaceci 1999), in San Luís Province) with approximately 800-1000 individuals (Merino <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011) and coastal Bahía de Samborombóm (Buenos Aires Province) with about 200 individuals (Merino <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1997) and in Santa Fé “Bajos Submeridionales” area there is a small subpopulation estimated to be less than 50 individuals which lives in an area of 23,000 ha. (Vera Department, Pautasso 2011). A small subpopulation may still be extant in the southeastern part of Bolivia (Weber and González 2003). Small subpopulations of Pampas Deer may still be extant in the National Park Noel Kempff Mercado (Santa Cruz Department), in southwestern Bolivia (Anderson 1985, 1993; Tarifa 1993). However, it is restricted to relatively small patches of suitable habitat and may have become locally extinct in some of them.",Decreasing,"The Pampas Deer occurs in insular populations in western, northern, and  central Argentina, eastern Bolivia, central and southern Brazil,  Paraguay, and Uruguay. Prior to the 1800s, the species was abundant  throughout the grasslands of South America (Wemmer 1998, González <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em>  2010). The Pampas Deer was a widespread species occupying a range of  open habitats, including grasslands, pampas and the Brazilian savanna  known as the Cerrado, in eastern South America from 5º to 41ºS (Cabrera  1943, Jackson 1987, Merino <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1997, González <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1998, 2002, González 2004, Weber and González 2003, González <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em>&#160;2010). However, the area encompassed by these habitats has been  dramatically reduced to less than 1% of that present in 1900 (González <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1998). Currently, Pampas Deer populations are generally small and highly isolated (Jackson and Langguth 1987; González <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1998, 2002).","For information on use and trade, see under Threats.",Terrestrial,"Included on CITES Appendix I. <br/><br/>In Argentina the entire Samborombón Bay area has been a protected area since the 1970s. The area currently includes two provincial reserves (Bahia de Samborombón and Rincón de Ajó) and one national park “Campos del Tuyú”; all of which were created with the purpose of providing refuge and protection to Pampas Deer. The entire Bay was included in the List of Wetlands of International Importance of the Ramsar Convention and was declared as Wildlife Refuge in 1997.<br/><br/>A Pampas Deer PHVA workshop was conducted in Uruguay in 1993 and conservation recommendations were listed for the main populations in Uruguay (González&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1994). Several conservation deer workshops were facilitated by Deer Specialist Group to plan management and conservation strategies for this species. These have been followed up by diverse research and conservation activities in the region.<br/><br/>Recommended conservation actions include further population surveys, ecological research, strengthening of existing management of protected areas, creation of new protected areas, establishment of a collaborative captive breeding programme, and enlisting the co-operation of local landowners in maintaining this species (Wemmer 1998). In 1984 the Province of Buenos Aires declared the species a ""Natural Monument"" in Argentina (Gimenez Dixon 1991). The provinces of Corrientes, and San Luis did likewise in the 1990s. Uruguay also declared it Natural Monument in 1985 (decree 12/9/85).<br/><br/>In spite of all these efforts, the majority of populations remain in fragile condition. Recommended conservation actions include further population surveys, ecological research, strengthening of existing management of protected areas, creation of new protected areas, establishment of a collaborative captive breeding programme, and enlisting the co-operation of local landowners in maintaining this species (Wemmer 1998). Some measures must be implemented to develop privately owned protected areas in order to preserve these last populations. These measures must include exoneration of taxes by government agencies and other fiscal incentives to stimulate private conservation action (González <em>et al.</em> 2002.).",Neotropical,,false,false,Global
22160266,13927,Muntiacus feae,Data Deficient,,2016,2015-11-17 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The species is listed as Data Deficient due to uncertainties over the validity of many reports of the species, and thus uncertainty over its geographic and ecological range and conservation status. If the species has a predominantly montane distribution between the Isthmus of Kra and ca. 16°N, then it might only be Least Concern or Near Threatened (this latter would be based primarily on range criteria), due to stability of habitat in protected areas and a relatively low hunting intensity in Thailand, especially at higher elevations. However, if it has a much wider distribution in Myanmar and or has a distribution significantly down to lower elevations, the species could be in one of the threatened categories by hunting and habitat loss especially in Myanmar. The high uncertainty over the species’ status even in the minimum conservative range of the species in Myanmar further clouds the assessment. If the species occurs (or occurred) in lowland forests in Myanmar, then it would almost certainly qualify as threatened, due to the loss of forest to plantations and high hunting pressure.","The limited information available suggests that the species is tied to evergreen forests of the hills and mountains of western Thailand and adjacent Myanmar (and perhaps further afield). The elevational range of the species is uncertain. In Myanmar evergreen forests are found down to the lowlands because of a relatively wet climate throughout the year, but on the more seasonal eastern Thai side lower elevations are predominantly clothed in drier often deciduous forest types. Its ecology appears to be similar to other muntjacs and it seems to share some of the widespread socio-ecological traits of other muntjacs, i.e. it is predominantly solitary and favours fruits and leaves in its diet (Lekagul and McNeely 1977). <br/><br/>Towards the centre of their known Thai range, in Kuiburi National Park, Fea’s appears to be relatively common in evergreen forest, being camera-trapped more frequently than Northern Red Muntjac even at elevations of 300 m asl. In open forest types, however, Northern Red Muntjac clearly dominates, and Fea’s doesn’t appear to use deciduous forest types much (if at all), for example in Kuiburi National Park it comes right to the edge of open habitat but doesn’t cross the line out of evergreen forest. In contrast, northern red muntjac overlaps with Fea’s in evergreen forest, including high elevation, although Fea’s may be the more common in montane evergreen forest above 1000 m asl (R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2008, but see note under Distribution about provisional status of such records). Further north in Thung Yai Wildlife Sanctuary the species appears to be commoner (based on cameras, sightings and interviews) than Northern Red Muntjac in forest habitats up to at least 1,000 m asl (there has been little survey work at higher altitudes), although sign abundance of muntjac species certainly declines with increasing altitude, especially above 1,000 m asl (Steinmetz <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008, Wanlop Chutipong pers. comm. 2014, R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2008). In contrast within Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary, which lies at a similar latitude to Thung Yai Wildlife Sanctuary, but further east, Fea’s Muntjac is rare even in montane evergreen forest. This may be due to a rain shadow effect which leaves forest in the east drier than forests in Myanmar or close to the border in westernmost Thailand (R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2008). The animals camera-trapped in Kaeng Krachan National Park probably use both semi-evergreen forest and a narrow band of secondary mixed deciduous forest at elevations of around 350 m and above (Dusit Ngoprasert pers. comm. 2014).","The species may be threatened at some level by a decrease in available habitat and by hunting. Most remaining habitat for the species in its presumed Thai range is now effectively protected and many of the surviving forest blocks are large, in particular the Western Forest Complex. Therefore it seems unlikely that the species is in serious threat from either factor at the present there (but note the uncertainty over range and the identification of many records) (Anak Pattanavibool pers. comm. 2008, R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2008). The apparent commonness of Fea’s Muntjac at low elevations in Kuiburi National Park, where hunting of this and Northern Red Muntjac occurs, suggests a similar degree of tolerance to hunting pressure as the later species, hunting was thought to have been relatively heavy in the past, enough to have significantly reduced all ungulate populations, although the initiation of protection measures appears to have turned the tide (R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2008, 2014). The species' use of lower elevations is imprecisely known, and may be related to climatic factors, thus if the species naturally occurred at relatively high densities in ‘wet’ lower forests, then the threat level faced by the species would be undoubtedly higher. Thus, even within the Western Forest Complex the ‘available habitat’ for Fea’s Muntjac would be concentrated at higher elevation, and in Thailand’s protected areas as a whole, land below <em>ca.</em> 400 m and areas of gentle terrain at higher elevations forms only a moderate fraction, <em>ca.</em> 30% of the total area (Chutipong <em>et al.</em> 2014, Wanlop Chutipong pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>The Thanintharyi (= Tensasserim) region of Myanmar is currently relatively intact, but the ongoing and projected conversion of forests to oil palm plantation in southern Myanmar (Leimgruber <em>et al.</em> 2005) is some level of threat. Such conversion could destroy all large blocks of forest in the lowlands and adjacent lower hills, which includes some of the elevation range of the species. Forest and thus deer at higher elevations would probably remain secure. Altitudinal distribution of the species is too little understood to allow adequate assessment of this threat.<br/><br/>It is thought that the forests of Tenasserim are much more heavily poached than adjacent Thai forests, and for instance poachers from Myanmar regularly cross the border into Kuiburi National Park, despite the fact that ungulate densities in Kuiburi National Park are already relatively low, thus suggesting that hunting intensity is much higher and ungulate densities now much lower in Myanmar (R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2014). Hunting levels in the known Myanmar range can be assumed to be high (Than Thaw pers. comm. 2006).<br/><br/>In the Taninthayi Nature Reserve (1,700 kmsq), in the northern Thanithayi Range, wildlife protection is limited despite the presence of park staff, and local professional hunters come in to the Nature Reserve to hunt a wide variety of species including muntjac. Local people adjacent to the area also use snares in the vicinity of their agricultural areas, and some also use home-made guns. Around 2005 a gas pipeline was constructed across the southern part of Taninthayi Nature Reserve. The pipeline, with a service track alongside it, is guarded by the army who have camps along it. The military personnel mainly rely on wildlife for their daily ration. The area affected is perhaps 15% of the Nature Reserve. Logging is also occurring, although on a small scale. In the southern Taninthayi range the situation is worse, largely because of the presence of many immigrant workers from central Myanmar, who have come to the area to work for oil palm and rubber plantations. These workers both set snares themselves and have also taught local communities these same snaring techniques. Hunting is much more openly practiced and is probably at least twice as worse as in the northern part of the range. The government is also still issuing licences to private timber companies for forest conversion to plantations, and already huge areas of land in the lowlands have been cleared to make way for oil palm and rubber plantations. There are two proposed protected areas in southern Taninthayi Range and one proposed protected area in the northern Taninthayi Range, none of which have any permanent staff (all Nay Myo Shwe pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>In northern Myanmar (not confirmed to be within the species' range), muntjacs are commonly hunted, particularly for pelts (Than Thaw pers. comm. 2006). In Thailand, Fea’s Muntjac is apparently not specifically targeted by hunters, perhaps because of scarcity relative to <em>M. vaginalis </em>in many of the areas supporting most of the hunting, and in several especially eastern areas its primary range in higher elevations which are not visited frequently by hunters (Anak Pattanavibool pers. comm. 2008).","Taking Thai records assigned to <em>M. feae</em> as truly representing the species, it is not infrequently camera-trapped and observed in evergreen forests of the mountains in Western Thailand, especially the Klong Saeng forest complex, Thung Yai Wildlife Sanctuary and Kuiburi National Park, and at least in the latter two areas, in evergreen forest, appears as or more common than Northern Red Muntjac (Anak Pattanavibool pers. comm. 2008, R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2008, Wanlop Chutipong pers. comm. 2014, but see note under Distribution about provisional status of such records). <br/><br/>Other than one possible camera-trap photograph from northern Myanmar (see Geographic Range above), no primary sources have been traced for recent status in Myanmar. It is solely assumed that the species would have been relatively widespread in the climatically wetter forest of Tenasserim (than the drier more westerly Thai forests) in a latitudinal range similar to that in Thailand. But it is thought that the forests of Tenasserim are much more heavily poached than adjacent Thai forests (R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2014).",Unknown,"Although the distribution of this species is usually given as from the Isthmus of Kra north and east through southern Myanmar and the adjacent Thai borderlands (Groves and Grubb 1990, Grubb 2005), there was until recently scant evidence of clearly identifiable records (i.e. those accompanied by information on diagnostic characters) from either country (i.e. some range localities appear to be based solely on reports from local people, Tun Yin 1967). Recent discoveries of new species of muntjac and extensions of known range for other muntjac species mean that some previous Thai and Myanmar localities for ‘<em>M. feae</em>’ (see Groves and Grubb 1990) should be viewed with caution. The presence in China remains unconfirmed (see taxonomic note). This leaves only the type locality of east of Moulmein, Myanmar, Muang district (9.08°N, 99.14°E), Surathani Province, and Raheng, Pangna Province (northeast of Phuket island), based on the origin of Thai captive animals and a Gairdner specimen in the Natural History Museum (NHM), London. Two other Gairdner specimens in the NHM, London are incomplete lacking skulls and heads (one of these was reportedly obtained at 300 m asl) and therefore cannot morphologically be confirmed as being this species (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). <br/><br/>Photographs of several muntjacs from Kaeng Krachan National Park (Thailand) appear to be of this species (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, based on Dusit Ngoprasert/WCS unpublished data). Camera-trapping in the western forest complex of Thailand has apparently documented the species on several further occasions, and animals have also been observed in the field (Wanlop Chutipong pers. comm. 2014, Anak Pattanavibool pers. comm. 2008, R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2008), but identification of these animals could be considered provisional because it has been assumed that only two muntjac species inhabit this part of Thailand (<em>M. feae </em>and <em>M. vaginalis</em>), this might not be the case. Animals have usually been identified on the basis of dark pelage and especially the blackish tail (Anak Pattanavibool pers. comm. 2008, R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2008), but such characters do not rule out some other muntjac species confirmed from neighbouring areas, including, <em>M. gongshanensis</em> and some animals in the, <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> species complex. Dark pelage does not even completely rule out <em>M. vaginalis</em> (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). The most northerly of the recent records assigned to this species is from Mae Wong National Park in montane forest at 1,450 m asl (16° 4' 46'' N, 99° 7' 4'' E) (Anak Pattanavibool pers. comm. 2008). <br/><br/>One photograph from 1,250 m asl in Hponkanrazi Wildlife Sanctuary in northern Myanmar shows a male with some features similar to <em>M. feae</em> (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, based on WCS unpublished data), and may refer to this species, particularly in the light of suggestions that the species is in China (see taxonomic note). This site lies far from the generally accepted Myanmar range of <em>M. feae</em> and raises the possibility that the species might have a much wider range in Myanmar than generally assumed. This record is not included in the distribution map (which should be considered highly provisional in any case). This record would also indicate sympatry with <em>M. gongshanensis</em>.","It could be assumed that this species is hunted by the local human populations, in a similar fashion to other species of the same genus, as a source of meat and perhaps to a lesser degree of skins and traditional medicines.",Terrestrial,"The species is presumed to be found within protected areas throughout its range; in Thailand, it is largely confined to protected areas (because most suitable habitat is now within protected areas), but it almost certainly will be found to persist both in and out of them in Myanmar.<br/><br/>There is a need for taxonomic work, including a re-evaluation of recent field and captive animals (there is a small captive population within Thai zoos) presumed to be <em>M. feae</em> with reference to the holotype, to determine that such animals are indeed this species. Diagnostic characters for the species also need to be clarified in light of recent discoveries of other muntjacs superficially similar in various morphological characteristics. Confirmation in particular is needed of camera trap records from Thailand and Myanmar as referring to this species rather than to any other darkish muntjac, and suggestions of the species' occurrence in China and far northern Myanmar need to be investigated (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2006). The species' status, habitat associations, and elevational limits need to be established with greater certainty (R.J.

Duckworth in litt. 2008). However, further south in Korea, where unmodified waterways and patches of fallow habitat persist, Water Deer appears capable of living in rice-paddies (N. Moores pers. comm. 2008). As suggested by its name, Water Deer can swim (Guo and Zhang 2002), but appears unlikely to colonize areas &gt;20 km from a source population. <br/> <br/>Other than during the mating season, it is in general a solitary species; stable pairs or small groups have been reported in places with high population densities. The rut, in England, starts in late November and extends through December and occasionally into January. From May to July, females will deliver litters of up to six fawns although the most common figure is only from one to three). Offspring mortality is high, with up to 40% of juveniles dying during their first four weeks.","Poaching and habitat destruction are major threats to this species (Won and Smith 1999). The species is valued for its meat, and for the semi-digested milk found in the rumen of unweaned fawns, which is used in traditional medicine as a cure against indigestion in children (Won and Smith 1999). It is sometimes trapped as a pest in China, and is reported to be a low-concern pest of rice fields in DPR Korea (J.W. Duckworth in litt. 2008). Hunting is carried out at night with dogs (Sun Lixing pers. comm. 1990). Most hunting in DPR Korea is probably with snares; guns are highly restricted and active hunting with dogs, although doubtless occurring to some extent, is too publicly visible to be the preferred choice. Snares for deer are at very high density in forest hill areas; no assessment has been made of their usage in the lower Chongchon plain where Water Deer remain common. It is not therefore possible to speculate on the species' resilience to such hunting (J.W. Duckworth in litt. 2008).<br/><br/>In Yancheng Nature Reserve, poaching is reported as severe, and there is high mortality during periods of flooding. Fawns have been bought from local people to establish and support the captive population, where the mortality rate is reportedly high (Zhang 1994).&#160;Water Deer&#160;have evidently been reduced or extirpated in most of the reserve, remaining only in the relatively small core area (Xu <em>et al</em>. 1998, Zhu <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/><br/>Habitat loss through reclamation for agriculture and urban development is a major threat to&#160;Water Deer&#160;in eastern China (Xu <em>et al</em>. 1998). Formerly widespread areas of appropriate habitat north of the Yangtze River delta have been lost and the remaining areas fragmented, leaving remaining subpopulations of&#160;Water Deer&#160;vulnerable. <br/><br/>The Korean subpopulations, at least in DPR Korea, are highly threatened by habitat loss, on the assumption that wild population will not persist in fully agricultural landscapes. It is reported, however, to be ""moderately widespread"" at least in the Republic of Korea. In DPR Korea, agricultural policies have led to a large-scale land rezoning programme which involves the canalisation of streams, removal of damp hollows and generally the conversion to active farmland of all areas within the plains which have retained semi-natural vegetation to date. This programme is ongoing. Coastal habitats have so far fared better but there are ambitious plans for the reclamation of large proportions of the intertidal areas on the west coast, and this will involve major loss of the currently extensive suitable habitat present in natural coastal plains. With no empirical information on the use of purely agricultural regions by&#160;Water Deer&#160;in Korea, the precise effects of these ongoing and planned habitat changes are unclear; field study is required. Ground-dwelling mammals in DPR Korea are under heavy snaring pressure, at least in forest areas. The extent of snaring in the non-forest habitats occupied by this species and the effects of snaring on local populations are unclear. The situation in the lower Chongchon plain, an area with high human population densities and heavy conversion of plains land to agriculture (although retaining a largely natural coastal zone and channel profile for the river itself) suggest that either snaring levels are not so high in these areas or Water Deer&#160;are resilient to them (J.W. Duckworth <em>in litt</em>. 2008).","Population densities have been said to be rather low in most places within its native range (Ohtaishi and Gao 1990, Won and Smith 1999, Hu <em>et al</em>. 2006), but few if any primary data have been presented in support of this. Signs (footprints, faeces) and sightings suggest high densities persist in semi-natural habitats of at least the lower (tidal) Chongchon plain of west-central DPR Korea (Pyongan North and Pyongang South provinces) in 2000-2004 although, as indicated above, some supplementation by released stock cannot be ruled out (J.W. Duckworth in litt. 2008). At another area holding the species in DPR Korea, Mount Kuwol (Hwanghae South province), signs were difficult to find in 1999 despite specific searches, although local farmers reported that significant numbers were still present. Repeated searches in the Myohyang mountains (Pyongan North, Pyongang South and Chagang provinces) in 1999-2004 found no evidence of the species but suitable habitat was marginal. Water Deer are readily observed in the outskirts of Pyongyang but are presumably releases and/or the descendents of releases. Reasonable numbers are reported to persist elsewhere in the DPR Korea lowlands (Ju Jong Sil, Academy of Sciences, verbally 2003 to J.W. Duckworth). <br/><br/>Water Deer occur in the Republic of Korea and it said to be ""moderately widespread"", particularly along the west coast, as well as within the demilitarized zone between the two Koreas (Kim and Cho 2005), but its population cannot be estimated. <br/><br/>Within China, Ohtaishi and Gao (1990) estimated fewer than 10,000 individuals in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River; 1,200-1,500 in coastal areas of Jiangsu; 600-800 in the Zhoushan Islands of Zhejiang; and 1,000 in the Poyang Lake (Jiangxi) region. Sheng (1998) estimated 500-1,1000 in the coastal areas of Jiangsu (see also Xu <em>et al</em>. 1998), 1,500 in the Zhoushan Islands, around 1,000 in the Poyong Lake region, and an additional ~500 individuals in Anhui. <br/><br/>Hu <em>et al</em>. (2006) present a map showing a considerable reduction in the current distribution of <em>H. inermis</em> compared with its known, historical range, and describe population declines of the species as ""drastic"". Their map suggests that the species no longer occurs in Jilin, Liaoning, Hebei, Shaanxi, Shandong, Henan, or Fujian provinces, and has become rarer in Hubei, Hunan, and Zhejiang provinces. However, the time period over which this range reduction is not known with any precision. Hu <em>et al.</em> (2006) also provide data suggesting that <em>H. inermis</em> in the eastern-most (and densest) populations within China in Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces retain a relatively high amount of genetic diversity, although populations on the Zhoushan archipelago displayed some divergence from those on the mainland. Within Yancheng Nature Reserve, their geographic distribution decreased and became markedly more fragmented between the 1980s and 2001 (Zhu <em>et al</em>. 2004).",Decreasing,"This species occurs in China (formerly from Liaoning to Guangxi including the lower Yangtze Basin) and Korea; it has been introduced to England and France (Whitehead 1993).<br/><br/>The Chinese population was originally found in Jilin and Liaoning provinces in the northeast of the country, in the eastern Yangtze Basin and islands at the mouth of this river, and in the southeast of the country in northwestern Guangdong, southern Hunan and central and eastern Guangxi (Ohtaishi and Gao 1990). According to Hu <em>et al</em>. (2006) it is now restricted in China to the central portion of that distribution in the eastern Yangtze Basin, and populations in northeastern and southeastern China are now extinct. <br/><br/>Currently, the species' distribution in both Koreas may be substantially reduced, but little specific information is available. It is reported as being ""relatively widespread"" in the Republic of Korea (N. Moores pers. comm. 2008), particularly along the west coast. It apparently remains relatively widespread in the lower-lying parts of DPR Korea, but assessing the true status is confounded by repeated reports of widespread and frequent releases of captive-bred stock. It is unclear at what levels these occurred in the past; since the mid-1990s they are likely to have been only at low, if any, levels in all except a few high profile areas. It is possible that Chinese stock have been included in the captive populations within DPR Korea, although this has not been confirmed (J.W. Duckworth in litt. 2008).","The Chinese Water Deer is legally and illegally hunted within its native area, as a source of venison and traditional medicines - the semi-digested milk found in the rumen of unweaned fawns is used in traditional medicine as a cure against indigestion in children (Won and Smith 1999).&#160;There is a very limited stalking market for this species in the UK.&#160;Specimens are usually killed during, or shortly after, the capture process.

However, nature reserve designation at Yancheng has evidently not prevented continued habitat loss and fragmentation (Zhu <em>et al</em>. 2004, Zhang <em>et al</em>. 2006a, b).

22165292,136551,Muntiacus vaginalis,Least Concern,,2016,2015-09-25 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Northern Red Muntjac are still widespread and common in much of South and South-east Asia, occur in many protected areas, and are resilient to habitat change and hunting. Populations in Pakistan and Bangladesh appear to be severely reduced, however. It is subject to intense trade-driven hunting in parts of its geographic range (particularly east of the Mekong) which are resulting in densities well below carrying capacity. There are thus regional variations in population trend. In Vietnam, Laos and parts of China declines probably have exceeded 30% in the last three generations (10–15 years) and on current trends can be confidently expected to do so in the next three generations in at least Laos and Vietnam and probably also Cambodia (reflecting major habitat fragmentation which compounds the effects of hunting). Future trends in China may be complex as recovery may be occurring in some areas (e.g. Hong Kong), whilst in others the population may be so small and restricted to remote and or nominally protected areas that the numbers of animals remaining to be hunted become a relatively small proportion of the total. The trend in Myanmar is clearly decreasing although the magnitude remains uncertain, but land clearance and protected area management there appears to be following a trajectory similar to that in Laos and Vietnam, albeit lagging behind by perhaps about a decade. On balance the large range in India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Thailand, probably greater than 50% of the species' geographic range, and enormous total population of these countries in only shallow decline, mean that the global population is unlikely to be declining overall (past present or future) at rates sufficient to warrant listing as even Near Threatened.","The Northern Red Muntjac inhabits a wide variety of forests and scrub, including level plains and rugged mountains, dense and open forests, evergreen and deciduous areas, old-growth and secondary forests, and even grass- and cropland near woody habitats, from sea-level commonly up to about 1,500 m asl and occasionally over, perhaps with some variation regionally (Blanford 1891, Prater 1971, Barrette 1977, 2004, Lekagul and McNeely 1977, Roberts 1977, Timmins <em>et al</em>. 1998, Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Teng <em>et al</em>. 2004). Within this broad habitat use, densities doubtless vary based on conditions. Steinmetz <em>et al</em>. (2008) found that signs, and presumably animals, were significantly more common in lower- than higher-lying areas of the Tenasserim–Dawna mountains, Thailand, noting that this was the opposite of the patterns that would be predicted if hunting (itself concentrated heavily in the lowlands) was the chief determinant of population densities. Population densities in Thailand are substantially higher in deciduous forest than in evergreen forest (Steinmetz and Mather 1996, Steinmetz<em> <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> </em>2010). Kushwaha <em>et al</em>. (2004) found that in Kumaon Himalaya (India), <em>M. vaginalis</em> frequently exploits grass- and herb-dominated environments, linked to highly logged locations, and with a preference for lower altitudes (although they did not specify what altitude range was covered, nor discuss the possibility that because logging tends to occur in valley bottoms and lower hills rather than on steep hills and ridges, a preference for lower altitudes could simply be a consequential effect of a preference for logged areas. Teng <em>et al</em>. (2004) found that in Hainan, muntjacs preferred shrub grassland and thorny shrubland, used dry savanna in proportion to its availability, and avoided woods, cultivated grass-plot, and deciduous monsoon forests. Sheng and Ohtaishi (1993) attributed the apparent stability in numbers of the Chinese population to logging activities, which were bringing about an increase of secondary forest and scrub dominated areas. A study of coffee estates around Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary, India, recorded Red Muntjac more widely than any other herbivorous mammal, including in coffee areas far from the sanctuary’s boundary (Bali <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>Its diet is based on fallen fruits, buds, small seeds, twigs, seed pods, tender leaves, and young grass (Barrette 1977, 2004, Lekagul and McNeely 1977, Roberts 1977, Chen <em>et al</em>. 2001, Teng <em>et al</em>. 2004). The species has been cited as a major dispersal agent of fruit-producing plants in southern China (Chen <em>et al</em>. 2001) and Thailand (Lekagul and McNeely 1977) and this is presumably so throughout its range.<br/><br/>In much of its range (although rather less than was popularly supposed until recently) this is the only muntjac species. Where congeners occur, it is widely sympatric, evidently even syntopic, with them, there is no solid evidence for competitive exclusion except perhaps at very high altitudes. Where it overlaps with Fea’s Muntjac <em>M. feae</em> in Thailand, Red clearly predominates in more deciduous habitats and lower altitudes, with Fea’s apparently more common in high altitudes and fully evergreen forest (R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2008). It probably occurs throughout the range of Large-antlered Muntjac <em>M. vuquangensis</em> (e.g. Timmins <em>et al</em>. 1998). There is extensive overlap with muntjacs of the <em>M. rooseveltorum</em> species-complex (<em>M. rooseveltorum</em>, <em>M. truongsonensis</em>, <em>M. puhoatensis</em> and <em>M. putaoensis</em>), but there may be areas above about 1,500 m asl where the latter greatly outnumber <em>M. vaginalis</em> and some where <em>M. vaginalis</em> is absent (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, based on examination of numerous camera-trap photographs from many camera-trap programmes). Camera-trap results from northern Myanmar suggest that Red Muntjac occurs largely below the altitudinal range of <em>M. gongshanensis</em>, but fully through the range of <em>M. putaoensis</em> (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008 based on WCS unpublished data). Schaller and Rabinowitz (2004), however, reported many <em>M. vaginalis</em> at high altitudes in Arunachal Pradesh, with one direct sighting at 3,000 m asl near Tawang, and there may therefore be significant local variation in the upper altitudinal limit. Two specimens in the Natural History Museum, London from Nepal have recorded altitudes of 11,400 and 8,500 feet (3,450 and 2,590 m asl) (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Camera-trapping in Bhutan has recorded the species relatively commonly between 2000 and 3650 m, over essentially the full elevation range surveyed, where this may be the only muntjac species present (K. Vernes, S. Dorji and R. Rajaratnam based on unpublished data pers. comm. 2014, photos seen by R.J. Timmins 2014).<br/><br/>Northern Red Muntjac appears to be able to breed all year around, although the existence of well-defined breeding seasons has been suggested for some populations, particularly in those inhabiting locations with a more seasonal climate (Barrette 1977, Lekagul and McNeely 1977, Roberts 1977, Chen <em>et al</em>. 2001). In any case, ""peaks"" of mating activity are present, at least, in some areas (Prater 1971, Barrette 1977, Roberts 1977). Despite only a single fawn being born each occasion, overall lifetime output is high (Barrette 2004). Even where births occur throughout the year, there is still a fairly rigid cycle of antler formation and shedding, synchronised at the population level (Barrette 1977, Mishra 1982, Acharjyo and Patnaik 1984). It tends to be solitary (Eisenberg and Lockhart 1972, Seidensticker 1976, Karanth and Sunquist 1992, Barrette 2004), reports of small groups could be attributed to mating pairs or to female/offspring units, or to temporary incidental proximity of individuals at concentrations of high-value food, e.g. fallen fruit under a tree (Barrette 1977, 2004, Lekagul and McNeely 1977). Individuals seem strongly attached to a certain home range, but there is no convincing evidence of territoriality (Barrette 1977, 2004). Northern Red Muntjac is diurnal in some areas, nocturnal in others (Prater 1971, Barrette 1977, Lekagul and McNeely 1977, Roberts 1977) and is probably best regarded as crepuscular. It is an important prey for Leopard <em>Panthera pardus</em>, Tiger <em>P. tigris</em>, and Dhole <em>Cuon alpinus</em>.","Northern Red Muntjac are hunted widely, both legally and illegally, over most of its range (Sheng and Ohtaishi 1993, Madhusudan and Karanth 2002, Tungittiplakorn and Dearden 2002, Jathanna <em>et al</em>. 2003, Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2003, Santiapillai and Wijeyamohan 2003, Hansel 2004, Kaul <em>et al</em>. 2004, Kumara and Singh 2004, Rao <em>et al</em>. 2005, Steinmetz <em>et al</em>. 2008), and it is probably among the most used and most desired wild meats in South and South-east Asia (e.g. Srikosamatara <em>et al</em>. 1992, Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999). Patterns of threat vary across the species' range. Viet Nam, Lao PDR and to a lesser extent Cambodia and northern Thailand are apparently the areas where mammal hunting has been heaviest. In its mainland China range, rates may be even higher, because a recent fire-arm ban is said to have pushed up levels of gin-trapping (B.P.L. Chan pers. comm. 2008). Muntjacs are hunted within a thriving hunting and wildlife trading culture in this area and in adjacent countries such as China and Thailand, involving many land vertebrate species, along with other forest products such as orchids and <em>Aquilaria</em> resin (e.g. Compton and Le Hai Quang 1998, Compton <em>et al</em>. 1999, Noreen and Claridge 2001). Such hunting reaches all areas, although in large rugged mountain forest blocks trade-driven hunting of species valued only for their meat (rather than high-value, low-weight, generally medicinal products that can be carried out efficiently from even the remotest areas) is still limited by economics of accessibility. The regional wild meat trade has little likelihood of abating as long as there are any pigs, muntjacs, and civets to be hunted. The human population of Viet Nam is more than 90 million, that of China more than 1,000 million. Together, they comprise an enormous market for wildlife products. For example, tens of millions of wild turtles are imported, legally and illegally, into China annually (van Dijk <em>et al</em>. 2000). There has been no comparable study of ungulate trade levels. Within the Northern and Central Annamites, every square kilometre of Viet Namese forest and of Lao forest that is within 5 km of the Viet Namese border probably has snares capable of capturing muntjacs set in it every year (Timmins <em>et al</em>. 2007, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Intensity in some areas probably reaches many thousands of snare-nights per square kilometre per year (Timmins <em>et al</em>. 2007). Snaring is less intensive in Lao PDR at least away from the Viet Namese border, but is increasing dramatically (Timmins and Robichaud 2005, W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. to R.J. Timmins 2007, Coudrat <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014, Timmins and Duckworth 2012, R.J. Timmins in press b, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). Hunting intensity had in recent decades been generally lower in southern Viet Nam than in Lao PDR and northern Viet Nam, leaving many wildlife populations less depleted (e.g. Le Xuan Canh <em>et al</em>. 1997, Timmins and Duckworth 2000, Polet and Ling 2004), but the general increase in regional hunting intensity and economic wealth indicate that hunting intensity in this region must also be increasing (Timmins <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008), as of 2014 there are indications that hunting intensity has reached equivalent levels to the north, at least in some areas (Timmins in press a). In northern Thailand when muntjacs become rare, the animals are hunted in group drives, the meat is often sold (Tungittiplakorn and Dearden 2002).<br/><br/>Closed tropical evergreen forests have inherently low ungulate biomass (Robinson and Bennett 2000), and beyond this populations of all wild animals larger than 20 kg in Indochina have been significantly reduced by human exploitation (Timmins and Ou 2001, Timmins <em>et al</em>. 2007, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Field survey encounter rates with Northern Red Muntjacs in Lao PDR, Viet Nam, and Cambodia are remarkably low compared with other areas in its range (Timmins and Ou 2001, Timmins <em>et al</em>. 2007, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). In a recent reconnaissance survey of highly fragmented habitat in southern Lao PDR (Pathoumphon district, Champasak province), outside the protected area system, muntjac were the only ungulates (assumed to relate to this species on habitat and distribution) for which signs were commonly found, even wild pigs <em>Sus</em> sp(p). being noticeably more scarce (K. Khounboline and J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). This pattern is general throughout Lao PDR (K. Khounboline pers. comm. 2008). However, areas of heavy hunting have lost muntjacs or had them reduced to extreme rarity, not only forest isolates such as Houay Nhang (a few square kilometres,, just outside Vientiane, Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1994) but also, where hunting has been extremely heavy, less fragmented landscapes (such as the western lowlands of Xe Bang-Nouan National Protected Area in south Lao PDR, J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). In such areas, even though forest within them is in general heavily degraded, habitat is unlikely to be the prime cause of decline, because in some other areas of long-standing forest devastation now dominated by a mix of secondary ruderals, shrubs and grasses, muntjacs are still relatively common, e.g. <em>Phongsali</em> (far northern Lao PDR), where they can even still be heard from the provincial capital town (Duckworth and Robichaud 2005). Similarly, Red Muntjac is common and widespread in Hong Kong, an almost deforested landscape (Chek 2006, R. Corlett pers. comm. 2008), and studies in Hainan indicated selection of openings and other edge habitats rather than forest interiors (Teng <em>et al</em>. 2004), this seems generally true throughout South-east Asia (R.J. Timmins and J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). There is also evidence from elsewhere in its range that this species is better able than most ungulates to withstand a certain degree of continuous harvesting as well as habitat disturbance (Jathanna <em>et al</em> 2003), although this has rarely been based on quantified status assessment. In Nagarahole National Park, India, Madhusudan and Karanth (2002) found no difference in muntjac abundance between a heavily hunted and a lightly hunted site, compared with enormous differences for most other ungulates. In the context of Indochina, even their heavily-hunted site would, however, rank as lightly hunted (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008, from based on visit and discussion). Madhusudan and Karanth (2002) cautioned against assuming that these results indicated an intrinsic resilience to hunting by this muntjac: it is not so readily hunted as, for example, Chital <em>Axis axis</em>, because of its solitary nature, affinity for dense cover and therefore risks of getting caught are higher when using appropriate techniques to kill or capture it. However, the ubiquitous disparity in status between <em>M. vaginalis</em> and other ungulates (and indeed almost all other mammals of similar or larger body weight) in Indochina indicates that it is truly much more resilient to hunting. Muntjac populations are capable of recovering quickly from overexploitation if hunting is controlled: an overhunted, low density population freed from hunting pressure in Thailand increased 10-fold in 6 years, a rate of increase that is likely near the biological maximum attainable by the species (Steinmetz <em><em><em>et al.</em></em> </em>2010). An intensive study of hunting on mammals in two Hmong villages of northern Thailand classified quarry species into tiers representing the sequence of loss through overhunting, muntjacs (most or all were presumably <em>M. vaginalis</em>) fell in the fifth tier, persisting much longer than all other ruminants and with only species like squirrels, civets, and linsangs being placed later in the extinction sequence (Tungittiplakorn and Dearden 2002). Even so, villagers reported that muntjacs were greatly reduced in numbers in the area. The strongest demonstration of its remarkable resilience is that it is now common and widespread in Hong Kong, an almost deforested landscape which has in the past sustained hunting and habitat disruption heavy enough to force extinction even of squirrels. Red Muntjac were reduced to very low populations a few decades ago, but did not become extinct, and has increased rapidly in recent years (Shek 2006, R. Corlett pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>While wild meat is the major driver of South-east Asian muntjac trade, parts such as antlers are also heavily traded (e.g. Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Noreen and Claridge 2001).<br/><br/>Rapid economic development and expanding wealth in the species' range, particularly South-east Asia and China, are increasing the demand for wildlife meat and ‘medicines’ (Timmins <em>et al</em>. 2007). Timmins <em>et al</em>. (2007) highlighted a common misconception, especially in documentation of development projects in the region, that poverty is a principal cause of biodiversity loss, but as they pointed out for Saola <em>Pseudoryx nghetinhensis</em>, the main driver of threats to wild ungulates, at least for the mid-term, is not rural poverty but increasing urban wealth in Indochina and China. Similarly, in Thailand, trade-driven hunting has been the main cause of muntjac and other wildlife population declines, regardless of protected area status (Steinmetz <em><em><em>et al.</em></em> </em>2006). In Viet Nam “the free market economy has resulted in feverish periods of trade in wild species nationwide, with negative impacts on biodiversity” (Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam 2004). In Cambodia, the same factor has fostered a thriving bushmeat market and hunting of species for international wildlife trade (Timmins and Ou 2001, Maxwell <em>et al</em>. 2006, Timmins 2006). There is a rapid, ongoing, expansion of wealthy social strata in Lao PDR, directly accelerated by illegal trade in rosewood, wild meat, and other forest resources, and by the economics of large infrastructure projects (e.g. Nan Theun 2 hydro-electric power project), creating a significantly greater in-country demand for luxury meats such as venison (W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. 2007). Wild meat is chosen in preference to farmed meat despite a greater price per unit weight (e.g. Hansel 2004). Markets along major roads such as route 13 (e.g. at Ban Namthon) have expanded, not contracted, in the last 15 years and have a huge (albeit unquantified) turnover of wild meat, at this specific market, multiple stalls are selling dried muntjac meat daily (balance of muntjac species unknown). The effects of hunting in Lao PDR, Viet Nam, Cambodia and Thailand have been exacerbated during the last two decades by habitat loss and various socio-economic factors, of which the most biologically significant are discussed in the Red List account for Large-antlered Muntjac <em>M. vuquangensis</em>.<br/><br/>Thus, even though this is one of the most resilient of large mammals in Indochina persisting in fragmented landscapes and often in peripheral forest areas, populations in Indochina (Viet Nam, Lao PDR and Cambodia) are likely to be declining significantly (perhaps at a level to trigger VU i.e. 30% in 10–15 years, for the regional population) (Timmins<em> <em><em>et al.</em></em> </em>2008). Densities especially in Lao PDR and Viet Nam are generally well below carrying capacity, although in extensive areas of Cambodia are likely to be more natural, as they are across the range west of the Mekong (Timmins <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008). Since 2008 rates of decline in Indochina have almost certainly increased and are now quite likely to be in the region of ‘30% in 10–15 years’, especially in Lao and Cambodia where economic growth has seen widespread landscape level changes in infrastructure and land use and concomitant rise in the value of bushmeat and in hunting pressure, although most areas in Vietnam may have already been so depleted prior to 2008 that hunting of residual animals has been relatively difficult since then, thus tempering decline rates, even though hunting intensity has probably increased (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014).","This adaptable and widespread species remains locally common in most of its range (e.g. Whitehead 1993, Le Xuan Canh <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 1997, Timmins <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 1998, Duckworth <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 1999, Lynam <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2001, Lynam 2003, Johnsingh <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2004, Polet and Ling 2004, Johnson <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2006, Steinmetz <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008), even in Hong Kong, an almost totally deforested landscape which has in the past sustained hunting and habitat disruption heavy enough to force extinction even of squirrels (R. Corlett pers. comm. 2008, Shek <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2007). About 20–30 individuals were estimated by Roberts (1977, based on a 1972 estimate) for Margalla National Park in northern Pakistan, this would account for most of the population surviving in that country at the time. In Bangladesh the species is the most widespread wild ungulate, more widely distributed even than wild hogs. However, the population is declining and the species is nowhere very common. It is a rare species with only a small population in the Sundarbans which constitutes half of the remaining forests of Bangladesh, but it is uncommon to rare in the remaining hill forest areas of northeast and southeast of the country (Md Anwarul Islam in litt. 2008, Suprio Chakma pers. comm. 2014), this reflects “rampant...forest destruction” during the British colonial era which was, if anything, even worse after independence (Khan 2003). Hunting is the main current threat, rather than habitat loss as it is a well-adapted species. Even so, muntjacs (assumed to be this species) can still be seen readily in the north-east (P.M. Thompson pers. comm. 2008). In the southeast in the Chittagong Hill Tracts muntjacs were detected in all of 38 surveyed grid cells (each 10,000 ha and &gt;50% forest cover) during a camera-trapping survey in 2010-2011, suggesting occupancy of essentially all remaining suitable habitat patches (Suprio Chakma pers. comm. 2014). The species’ status in China is somewhat clouded by the overlap in range with<em> M. reevesi</em> (as well potentially as other muntjac species), both species have mapped ranges in eastern Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Guangdong, southern Hunan and southern Jiangxi and possibly western Fujian (Zhang <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 1997, Corbet and Hill 1992). In some areas camera-trap pictures of these two species may be very difficult to tell apart (R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). For instance there was much uncertainty about the identity of animals in Hong Kong with thoughts that perhaps only <em>M. reevesi </em>occured (Shek 2006), however camera-trapping surveys recently concluded that <em>M. vaginalis</em> [as <em>M. muntjak s.l.</em>] was the only species present (Shek <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2007), but further investigation is warranted as although some animals do appear to be diagnosable as <em>M. vaginalis</em>, some other captive animals at the Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden and a photo of a female in Shek (2006) show character combinations that make firm diagnosis as <em>M. vaginalis</em> or <em>M. reevesi </em>impossible, suggesting perhaps introgression (R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014), Shek <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> (2007) note significant differences in general pelage of muntjac in Hong Kong. In Hong Kong muntjac populations would appear to be stable and “very common”, having increased from a low point at some point in the past (Shek <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2007, Pei <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010). Population status of muntjacs is presumed to be worst in the southern provinces especially Guangxi, Guangdong, but it is currently unclear whether there are differences in status between <em>M. vaginalis</em> and <em>M. reevesi</em> in these provinces. On the basis of recent surveys using multiple methods including camera-trapping (Lau <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010) muntjacs (species uncertain) remain relatively widespread and appear to persist in most reasonably sized areas of suitable habitat in Guangxi, Guangdong and southern Jiangxi where hunting pressure is extremely high and populations of almost all large mammals are severely depressed or extirpated (Lau <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010, B.P.L. Chan and M.W.N. Lau pers. comm. 2014). However at a site based level muntjac in these provinces are notably scarcer than in Hong Kong, based on encounter rates of calls, faeces and camera-trap photographs, this is attributed by rural hunters to recent very heavy hunting with gin-traps precipitated by a fire-arm ban (B.P.L. Chan and M.W.N. Lau pers. comm. 2008). Status appears to be similar in Hainan, where <em>M. vaginalis</em> is currently the only known species, and hunting pressure is high (Lau <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010, M.W.N. Lau pers. comm. 2014), although in some well protected areas the species appears to be abundant with incredibly high densities reported (e.g. 54 animals/km²: Teng <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2005, such high densities are clearly unnatural and suggest either methodological error or peculiar ecological circumstances).<br/>Although Sheng and Ohtaishi (1993) stated that the total Chinese population of <em>M. vaginalis</em> [as <em>M. muntjak s. l.</em>] was about 500,000, the assumptions behind such a number were not explicit and it should be treated with great caution. Ohtaishi and Gao (1990) estimated that a total of 30,000 individuals were harvested each year on Hainan Island alone. <br/><br/>Populations are certainly also declining in Lao PDR, Cambodia and Viet Nam, through heavy trade-driven hunting (see threats). Muntjacs in a number of Thai protected areas are increasing (Steinmetz <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010, Steinmetz <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> in press) so the era of widespread population decline in Thailand might have largely ended, as few are likely to remain outside of protected areas. ‘Red’ muntjacs are common in Kaeng Krachan National Park, Thailand (Ngoprasert <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2007), but this is within the main transition zone between Sundaic and northern taxa, so the species there is/are unknown. Populations in Nepal are thought to be relatively stable (Hem Sagar Baral pers. comm. 2008). Muntjac in deciduous forests in western Thailand attain densities of 2.1–3.1 individuals/km² (Srikosamatara, 1993, Steinmetz and Mather, 1996, Sukmasuang, 2001). Densities are 2.2/km² in the deciduous forests of eastern Cambodia (Gray <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012). The following densities have been estimated in India: Bhadra Tiger Reserve, 3.64 +/- 0.63 (SE) per km² (Jathanna <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2003), Kanha moist deciduous forest, 0.6 animals per km² (Karanth and Nichols 2000), Nagarahole moist deciduous forest, 6 animals per km² (Karanth and Nichols 2000), Bandipur dry deciduous forest, 0.7 animals per km² (Karanth and Nichols 2000), Tadoba-Andhari dry deciduous forest, 0.9 animals per km² (Karanth and Kumar 2005), Melghat dry deciduous forest, 0.6 animals per km² (Karanth and Kumar 2005), Wilpattu, Sri Lanka, 2.5 animals per km² (Barrette 1977), Karnali-Bardia, Nepal, 1.7 animals per km² (Dinerstein 1987), and Rajaji National Park, 1 animal per km² (A.J.T. Johnsingh pers. comm. to Barrette 2004). Where studied, population densities are always well below those of herding ungulates (previous citations), but this is not so in areas where hunting has perverted ratios, where Northern Red Muntjac may even be the only deer species remaining.",Decreasing,"This species occurs in Sri Lanka, most of India, northern Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and southern China, including Hainan and southern Tibet, and into southeast Asia (Myanmar, Thailand, Lao PDR, Viet Nam, Cambodia) south to the northern part of the Thai–Malay peninsula (Roberts 1977, Groves and Grubb 1990, Ohtaishi and Gao 1990, Corbet and Hill 1992, Wang Ying-xiang 2002, Groves 2003, Grubb 2005). The precise southern range limit remains unclear on the Thai–Malay peninsula (see Taxonomy). It has been introduced in the Andaman Islands (Corbet and Hill 1992). It is widespread in most range states, except Pakistan (see Population).","This species is widely traded and hunted in China and Southeast Asian countries. China appears to be a major consumer and producer of&#160;<em>Muntiacus vaginalis</em>&#160;products. There is an intense commercial activity of this species from bordering Southeast Asian countries into China which involves meat, hides and medicinal products. (Ohtaishi and Gao 1990, Sheng and Ohtaishi 1993, Zhijun&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996, Duckworth&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1999, see also other references in General Information section).&#160;It is not usually kept as livestock.",Terrestrial,"Northern Red Muntjac occurs in many protected areas throughout its range and in most countries is covered by laws regulating hunting at some level. Across large parts of its range, the species would benefit if these national laws involving the protection of the species were more efficiently enforced, particularly those which relate to wildlife trading. Also, greater effort should be devoted to engaging local communities in the protection and recovery of wildlife populations in nearby protected areas. The proactive involvement of communities has resulted in increased population trends of muntjac and other hunted species at various sites in the region.",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global
22166396,42189,Muntiacus atherodes,Near Threatened,,2016,2015-02-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Muntiacus atherodes </em>apparently remains widespread and at least locally common. Although data strongly suggest it is predominantly a lowland species, it occurs substantially above the level lowlands; in these latter areas the pace of forest conversion is alone sufficient to result in listing as Vulnerable or Near Threatened for forest obligates even of somewhat shorter generation lengths (see BirdLife International 2001), but this muntjac appears to have too wide an altitudinal range for this to be applied. However, forest loss even up to 750 m has been significant (probably around 15% between 2000 and 2010) and some preliminary data suggest that the species is strongly associated with gentle terrain and avoids rugged areas and steep slopes, which could mean that the loss in terms of <em>M. atherodes</em> numbers has been an even higher proportion.<br/><br/>Muntjacs are subject to intense harvesting in at least some areas of Borneo, and there is good evidence from Malaysian Borneo that this depresses population densities significantly. There is also evidence that Yellow Muntjac is more scarce in logged than in old-growth forest, in contrast to the pattern shown by sympatric <em>M. muntjak</em>. Hunting, logging and post-logging conversion to non-forest are ongoing and can be predicted to continue to reduce populations. However, this species remains common in some areas with both heavy hunting and habitat conversion. Therefore, rates of decline cannot be calculated or even easily inferred (even of muntjac spp. in general, let alone of determining whether <em>M. atherodes</em> is changing in relative frequency).<br/><br/>Concerning the appropriate red list category for this species, there was little convergence of opinion during the 2008 assessment among people surveying mammals on Borneo, except that it was unlikely to fall in any of the threatened categories. Since 2008 what data there are have leant more weight to the probability that the rate of decline could be more substantial than generally conceived; after all detecting even 20% declines in inherently ‘common’ and widespread species is likely to be very difficult on the basis of largely ‘incidental’ data. During the 2008 assessment some felt strongly that it was unlikely that Bornean Yellow Muntjac could be declining fast enough to warrant listing even as Near Threatened. However, with hindsight, it now seems also plausible that when considering potential combined impacts of forest loss, logging and hunting in light of increasing understanding of the species’ ecology, that listing as Vulnerable under scenario A2cd is conceivable. Thus, with reservations, it is listed here as Near Threatened considering that there is reasonable likelihood that declines in the past fifteen years have exceeded 20% and might even have been significantly higher, yet it is an assessment based on few precise data, at times contradictory, and which warrants review whenever a clearer picture is available.","Payne <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (1985) stated that “available data suggests that this species predominates over the Red Muntjac in low hill ranges and coastal regions”, but Meijaard and Sheil (2008) pointed out that still “no robust quantitative data exist to support this [pattern]”. An incomplete review of altitudes associated with museum specimens by R.J. Timmins (pers. comm. 2008) suggests no readily apparent difference between <em>M. atherodes</em> and <em>M. muntjak</em> in the altitudes of historically collected animals, in fact there appear to have been very few muntjacs collected at altitudes over 900 m, presumably partly reflecting the relatively small area of Borneo above such altitudes (Timmins <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> pers. comm. 2008). There is, however, an opinion by many field observers that Bornean Yellow Muntjac is genuinely absent from mountains (Timmins <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> pers. comm. 2008), yet there are specimen records from over 900 m and camera-trap records from over 1,100 m (R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2015, Hearn <em><em>et al.</em></em> unpub. data).<br/><br/>Based on camera-trapping undertaken between 2008 and 2010 in Sabah in three forest areas all identifiable muntjac photographs were of <em>M. atherodes</em>. The three forest areas were Deramakot (FSC certified and well managed) [below 400 m] in which there were 1,916 trap-days of effort, where muntjacs were recorded from 27 of 48 camera stations, and out of these 18 had confirmed <em>M. atherodes</em>, Tangkulap (more disturbed by conventional selective logging but logging stopped 10 years ago) [below 400 m] in which there were 2,203 trap-days of effort, where muntjacs were recorded from 6 of 64 camera stations, at all six with confirmed <em>M.</em> <em>atherodes</em>, and Segaliud Lokan (also more disturbed by conventional selective logging, only RIL logging is being continued) [below 400 m] in which there were 2,933 trap-days of effort, where muntjacs were recorded from 11 of 58 camera stations, and out of these 10 locations had confirmed <em>M. atherodes</em>. <em>M. muntjak</em> by comparison was not definitely recorded, although single individuals photographed in Deramakot might have been this species and a female and fawn in Segaliud Lokan were probably this species. All three sites are lowland forest reserves and both Deramakot and Tangkulap had high patrol effort by rangers from Sabah Forestry Department during the study, no evidence of hunting was found during the project. In Segaliud Lokan rangers reported that sometimes they encountered hunters in the forest during patrolling, although no evidence of hunting was found during the project (all information from A. Mohamed and A. Wilting pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>It was common in Sungai Wain forest, Kalimantan, which spans 30–150 m asl, and clearly out numbers <em>M. muntjak</em> there (G.M. Fredriksson pers. comm. 2008). It also seems to be the predominant species in Sarawak Planted Forests, Bintulu Division, a mix of Acacia mangium plantation and natural forest, where it uses mature and immature plantation, freshly logged forest and relict tall forest, nearby it has also been found in oil palm (Belden <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2007, Belden Giman pers. comm. 2008). Since the 2008 assessment the population in this lowland area seems stable (Belden Giman pers. comm. 2014). In this mosaic region the majority of camera-trap photos have come from plantation areas rather than natural forest, and although harvesting has taken place in the plantations this seems not to have affected the muntjac population (Belden Giman pers. comm. 2014). In the Ulu Segama area of Danum Valley Conservation Area, Sabah, mostly at about 300 m Asl, <em>M. atherodes</em> was slightly more common than <em>M. muntjak</em> (Siew Te Wong pers. comm. 2008). Muntjacs were frequently seen, suspected to comprise roughly equal numbers of the two species, in the Batang Ai National Park, Sarawak, which lies mostly at 100–760 m asl (Meredith 1996). <em>M. atherodes</em> occurs down to sea-level (in e.g. Similajau National Park, Sarawak, Duckworth 1997) and up to at least 3,000 feet (approximately 900 m asl), based on specimens in the Field Museum (Chicago, USA, R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Mohd Azlan J. (pers. comm. 2008) has recorded muntjacs provisionally recorded as this species in hill dipterocarp forest at both Lambir Hills National Park and Lanjak Entimau Wildlife Sanctuary. Field observation suggests that it occurs naturally only below 1,000 m asl, although semi-captive individuals live as high as 3,000 m asl (Belden Giman pers. comm. 2006). Camera-trapping between 2010 and 2012, in 15 sites in Sabah and Sarawak recorded many muntjacs, based on provisional identification of the photos, it appeared that the two species may have had approximately similar abundance below <em>ca </em>300 m, but <em>M. atherodes</em> abundance declined very quickly with increasing elevation, the preliminary review of the data also suggested that <em>M. atherodes</em> abundance was lower in logged areas than in unlogged areas, while <em>M. muntjak</em> abundance was not discernably affected by logging (Brodie unpublished data, J. Brodie in litt. 2014).<br/><br/>Preliminary camera-trapping results from nine different forest reserves and protected areas across Sabah found high naive occupancy results for Yellow Muntjac from lowland sites, but low occupancy at highland sites, however the highest detections were from over 1,100 m (Hearn, Ross and Macdonald, unpublished data). It uses both primary and secondary forest (Matsubayashi and Sukor 2005, Belden Giman pers. comm. 2008), although no specific information is available on its tolerance to severe degradation and fragmentation. Preliminary analysis of muntjac records from camera-trapping between 2010 and 2012, in eight sites in Sabah and Sarawak, suggest the species might have lower abundance in newly logged forest, whilst <em>M. muntjak</em> abundance potentially was higher, compared with unlogged forest (Brodie unpublished data, J. Brodie in litt. 2014). Preliminary results from 9 different forest reserves and protected areas across Sabah also suggest Yellow Muntjac may be negatively affected by logging whilst Red Muntjac may be less affected (Hearn, Ross and Macdonald, unpub. data). Presumably <em>M. atherodes</em> cannot survive complete forest conversion, but this has not been demonstrated or even, it seems, specifically investigated.<br/><br/>Its diet includes herbs, seeds, grass and fruits (Payne <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1985). It is mostly active during the daytime (Payne <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1985, Yasuma and Abdullah 1997, Ross <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013) but at least sometimes at night (Duckworth 1997). It lives in small territories and moves either in pairs or alone (Payne <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1985). Breeding seasonality is unknown.","Habitat encroachment and hunting are both widespread on Borneo. Indeed, they are often associated and all the island’s ungulates suffer from the increased hunting that often accompanies logging (Bennett and Dahaban 1995, Bennett and Gumal 2001), such that hunting to local extinction is the chief detrimental effect of logging on ungulates in Sarawak (Bennett and Gumal 2001). Hunting is for meat, medicine and hides.<br/><br/>The extent to which habitat encroachment and hunting constitute threats specifically to <em>M. atherodes</em> is unclear, reflecting a paucity of studies to determine its resilience. Logging has been reported to lead to slight decreases in densities of the species, and this seems to be due to habitat change per se rather than elevated hunting (which usually accompanies logging; Bennett and Gumal 2001) because <em>M. muntjak</em> in the same study was found to increase strongly after logging (Heydon 1994). In the Sarawak Planted Forests, Bintulu Division, Sarawak, muntjacs (probably mostly this species) are among the commonest species camera-trapped in young <em>Acacia mangium</em> plantations (under four years old) and have been seen browsing on young acacia shoots. Footprints are common in the adjacent newly planted areas and forest fragments (Belden Giman pers. comm. 2008). However, this area contains a substantial proportion of natural, if somewhat degraded, forest, which in theory might be found to be necessary for populations in the highly altered habitats. Information on the species in landscape-scale plantations has not been traced. In terms of coping with fragmentation, <em>M. atherodes</em> has survived at least for several years in several forest isolates of 100 km² or less, Similajau National Park (Sarawak; J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. based on observations in 2005), Sepilok Forest Reserve (only 42 km²; muntjacs not confirmed as this species; Siew Te Wong pers. comm. 2008), and Sungai Wain (Kalimantan; G.M. Fredriksson pers. comm. 2008); in the latter, where there is little hunting except around the margins, it is common. But the current carving up of the formerly extensive forest of lowland Borneo is so recent that determining long-term persistence in such fragments is impossible; doomed populations in slow but fixed decline may account for records in fragmented and degraded areas. There is no good evidence that any muntjac is tied to old-growth forest, however, even in areas where two or more species are sympatric (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>Muntjacs are widely and heavily hunted on Borneo for meat, skins, and as a source of traditional remedies (Bennett <em>et al</em>. 2000; Mohd Azlan J. pers. comm. 2008; Belden Giman pers. comm. 2008; G. M. Fredriksson pers. comm. 2008; A. C. Sebastian pers. comm. 2008; Siew Te Wong pers. comm. 2008). Traditionally, hunting used traps, dogs and spears, and blowpipes. Hunters in remote parts of the interior still use these methods, but most animals now die by gunfire. Sarawak held 60,000 legally registered shotguns while Sabah held almost 13,000 in the mid 1990s (Bennett <em>et al</em>. 2000). Methods used in Indonesia include guns and spotlights along logging roads, snaring, and dogs (G. M. Fredriksson pers. comm. 2008). The combination of dogs and guns may be particularly efficient (Belden Giman pers. comm. 2008). Snaring is still very heavy for the region (although bears no comparison to the extremely intensive snaring levels found for instance in Vietnam, outside well-secured areas, but at least in some areas seems not to catch many of this species: Belden Giman (pers. comm. 2008) found during interviews with 75 longhouses inside the Sarawak Planted Forests (Bintulu) that the highest percentage (73% and 12%) of game species caught by snares were pigs and porcupines respectively; muntjacs (both species) totalled less than 2% of animals, even though in this area they are common. Shotguns remain the even bigger problem (Bennett <em>et al</em>. 2000; Mohd Azlan J. pers. comm. 2008; Siew Te Wong pers. comm. 2008). Unaccompanied packs of stray or even perhaps feral dogs are also likely to be a threat, particularly in forest isolates close to urban areas (e.g. Similajau National Park; J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). It is unlikely that hunters make any distinction between the two Bornean muntjac species directly, although it is plausible that <em>M. atherodes</em> is under higher hunting pressure than is <em>M. muntjak</em> reflecting its purported predominance in the lowlands, where most of the logging concessions currently lie. Plantation estates are also concentrated in the lowlands, but Bennett <em>et al</em>. (2000) found that hunting levels in them were low, not least because they supported so few animals that would-be hunters preferred to journey to forest areas. Even when these were nearby, few labourers were hunting, because of the demands of their job, and, crucially, the disincentives by plantations companies for them to own shotguns. As non-locals with limited financial security, most followed employer rules preventing ownership of guns. Experience elsewhere shows that in such situations, local hunters may see such concentrations of labourers as potential markets, therefore leading to an increase in hunting even though it is not undertaken directly by the labourers. As plantations cover ever more Bornean lowlands, this may become a more significant stimulant of hunting. Also, although some ethnic groups, at least the Punan, have traditional beliefs against eating muntjac meat (Belden Giman pers. comm. 2008), over most of (at least) Malaysian Borneo, “in general, everyone will hunt and eat anything” (Bennett <em>et al</em>. 2000). Much hunting is for the market rather than local use, so there is a limitless demand. Bennett and Gumal (2001) profiled the hunting of ungulates in Sarawak in the mid 1990s thus: muntjacs (along with Bearded Pig <em>Sus barbatus</em> and Sambar <em>Rusa unicolor</em>) are heavily shot for wild meat trade across Sarawak, and these ungulates are the species most sought by the restaurants. Wild meat is widely sold in towns, villages, restaurants and logging camps throughout Sarawak; 250 sales outlets were estimated across the state in 1996, with an annual trade worth 3.75 million USD. Along the Rejang river alone, in the mid 1980s, 250 muntjacs were sold per year (Caldecott 1988). The market for meat is great and in the 1990s was probably expanding. There were, then, no controls on commercial hunting of non-protected species (including muntjacs). The implementation of the Master Plan for Wildlife in Sarawak (Wildlife Conservation Society and Sarawak Forest Department 1996) introduced a strict ban on all wildlife trade, shotgun ownership and cartridge sales in the late 1990s (Bennett and Gumal 2001). Substantial numbers of muntjacs are, nevertheless, still killed in the state, as they are elsewhere in Borneo.<br/><br/>Bennett <em>et al</em>. (2000) considered the effects of this onslaught upon muntjacs (not distinguished to species) through a lengthy hunting study in February 1993 to June 1995, in both Bornean states of Malaysia (Sarawak and Sabah), each with eight study areas. Muntjacs constituted only 4–11% of animals killed, but index counts of signs show an inverse relationship between sign index and hunting pressure so strong that the latter over-rode the effects of habitat variables in determining their densities. Hunting was so ubiquitous, even in protected areas, that in the two states, only one site (part of Danum Valley, Sabah) could be found as a control, where there was primary forest but negligible hunting levels. They concluded that “the only single factor offering any effective protection for [quarry species of] wildlife is difficulty of access”; whether animals are protected or non-protected species, inside or outside protected areas, had no significant restraint on hunting levels. Since that study, much forest has been converted and muntjac populations in the smaller and more isolated areas that remain must now be more vulnerable to local extinctions.<br/><br/>Against this backdrop of evidence for widespread hunting of muntjacs, the <em>M. atherodes</em> population in Sarawak Planted Forests, Bintulu Division appears to have been stable between 2008 and 2014 despite some ongoing illegal hunting; in this area pigs <em>Sus </em>and Sambar <em>Rusa unicolor </em>appear to be the primary quarry (Belden Giman pers. comm. 2014).","This species appears to be widespread and often common throughout its range, wherever appropriate habitat occurs (Yasuma and Abdullah 1997, Belden Giman pers. comm. 2006; see further discussion in the Habitats and Ecology section). Numbers seem to be in some decline in the Indonesian part of Borneo (Semiadi 2006). They may also be in decline in Malaysian Borneo (Bennett <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2000), although this study did not distinguish the two species of muntjac. Around the Bintulu lowlands the species remains common despite major habitat disruption and high levels of hunting relative to the region (Belden Giman pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>Forest loss on Borneo below 750 m has been calculated as <em>ca</em> 16.5% between 2000 and 2010, this figure includes both peat swamp and mangrove forest where percentage losses have been higher than other forest types (derived for Borneo from Miettinen <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2011), however it seems likely that in forest types used by <em>M. atherodes</em> the loss has been over 10% and likely even over 15% (A. Wilting pers. comm. 2014). However there is evidence from at least one area that the species is able to use plantation forests (see the Habitats and Ecology section), which could mean that the percentage population decrease of <em>M. atherodes</em> below 750 m as a result of forest loss is somewhat less than the percentage loss of forest would suggest. Evidence from at least two separate studies suggests (see the Habitat and Ecology section) that significant population decline occurs during intensive logging operations, and that significant population depression continues for years after logging has ceased. Suggesting that even in remaining forests below 750 m [Between 1973 and 2010 an estimated 37.8 % of forest has been lost and an additional 34% of forests below 500m have been logged in some way (Gaveau <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014)] significant population declines have taken place. Hunting has been considered a significant issue for the species in many lowland areas, both logged and unlogged (see the Threats section) and this has undoubtedly resulted in further population reductions above and beyond those simply resulting from habitat changes as a result of logging or forest loss.<br/><br/>Estimating the true population reduction over <em>ca </em>the last 15 years (assuming a generation length of <em>ca </em>5 years) is extremely difficult, however a suspected decline of 20-25% seems quite plausible, in view of the likelihood that the species has a predominantly lowland distribution and favours gentle terrain (see the Habitat and Ecology section).",Decreasing,"This species occurs only on Borneo, and lives throughout the island; many specific localities are given in Groves and Grubb (1982). No information was traced concerning its presence in Brunei but presumably it lives there. It is present in both Indonesia (Kalimantan) and Malaysia (Sabah and Sarawak). The Bornean Yellow Muntjac is known from most of the forest protected areas in Sarawak, including Bako National Park, Lanjak-Entimau Wildlife Sanctuary, Similajau National Park, Lambir Hills National Park, Samunsam National Park, Gunung Gading National Park (in the lowland part), Mulu and Niah National Park, and has also been recorded in logged forest in the Bintulu area and in oil palm adjacent to recently logged forest in north-east of Bintulu (Belden Giman pers. comm. 2008).","The Bornean Yellow Muntjac is hunted for&#160;meat, skins, and as a source of traditional remedies. It is not usually kept as livestock.",Terrestrial,"Yellow Muntjac is known from many protected areas in Malaysia and Indonesia. Protected area coverage in the lowland plains is still relatively limited in Borneo, and many areas are, in terms of forest ungulate protection, sufficiently small (under 100 sq. km) that long-term persistence cannot be assumed; most places will require continuous hands-on activities against poaching. Even protected areas are not securing lowland forest on current trends, at least in some parts of Borneo: Curran <em>et al</em>. (2004) demonstrated substantial loss of lowland forest within protected areas of Indonesian Borneo. Indonesian forestry law protects all species of muntjac (D. Martyr pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>Heavy hunting with shotguns was found to be a severe problem for larger mammals and birds across Sarawak and the need for its control (of guns and of sale of ammunition, with firm legal underpinnings) was recognised in the Master Plan for Wildlife in Sarawak (Wildlife Conservation Society and Sarawak Forest Department 1996). As everywhere, people devise ways for circumventing the controls (illegal trade in bullets and locally made shot-guns, called bekakok, which have no administrative or legal paper-trail) and strong enforcement is required for the foreseeable future.<br/><br/>The long-term persistence of large populations of Bornean Yellow Muntjac, as distinct from isolated populations in well-secured protected areas, will depend upon their ability to use plantation landscapes of oil palm, rubber, acacia and others. Clarification of this is needed to assess the species’s conservation priorities. Of particular concern is the finding from Sabah suggesting that <em>M. atherodes</em> may be more a species of old-growth forest and <em>M. muntjak</em> the predominant species of logged areas (Heydon 1994). It is urgent to determine whether this is a generally applicable pattern across Borneo.<br/><br/>Close liaison with plantation estates and other employers of large numbers of labourers is essential as this offers the best medium to control hunting by employees. As the proportion of plantation rises this will become ever more important. Similar arrangements are needed with logging concession-holders, even more importantly because of the high hunting levels by and/for loggers. <br/><br/>In future studies, ways of enhancing information specific to muntjac species need to be sought and implemented. Many of the studies reviewed here would not, for example, have detected wild changes in the relative proportions of the two muntjac species within their results concerning muntjac spp. This is a major concern, given that <em>M. atherodes</em> is likely to be most everywhere sympatric with <em>M. muntjak</em>. With cheap digital cameras now available, some form of photography, by the hunter, of each animal killed should be considered (and this would be beneficial for other Bornean genera with closely similar species, e.g. chevrotains <em>Tragulus</em>). Most of the grey literature was not available to the present review and much could be learnt from a more comprehensive trawl of it and of active surveyors.",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

However potential rates of future population decline in both core populations (see below) may approach thresholds (&gt;80%) sufficient to merit a change in status to Critically Endangered in the near future. Monitoring and collating the extent of habitat loss and loss of populations over the next 5-10 years is required.</p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">There are two numerically significant units (defined through threat profile, recent history and short-term prospects, not as populations in any demographically meaningful sense) of wild Eld’s Deer, <em>R. e. thamin</em> in Myanmar and <em>R. e. siamensis</em> of Cambodia, Lao and Viet Nam (of which the overwhelming majority of animals are in Cambodia). Numbers in India are numerically less significant for determining species-level population trends and the semi-captive herds in Hainan (now increasing) are excluded as are introduced Thai subpopulations. Since the 2008 assessment rates of habitat loss and degradation within the species’ preferred lowland deciduous forest in Indochina, which supports the majority of the wild <em>R. e. siamensis</em> population, have accelerated due to expansion of economic and social land concessions into previously remote forested areas in Cambodia’s northern and eastern plains. This is impacting both protected and non-protected forests and no Eld’s Deer subpopulations are thus effectively secure. Given this threat (and the presumed status of the Myanmar subpopulations see below) regular re-assessment of the species’ IUCN categorization is merited. In addition, the Cambodian subpopulations are small (potentially none exceeding 50 mature individuals), functionally isolated, and largely outside the core zones of protected areas. All subpopulations also remain impacted by hunting.</span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">The status of the Myanmar subpopulations is also likely to be declining due to a combination of habitat loss and hunting. Recent (2014) evidence from Myanmar indicates considerable loss of suitable lowland deciduous forest in central Myanmar and a potentially significant decline at one of the countries two core sites (Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary) (W. McShea in litt. 2014). The Manipur subpopulation is stable but its small size (approximately 100 individuals; Hussain<em> et al. </em>2009, M.J Ranjitsinh in litt. 2014) and threatened habitat in a single small protected area leave little cause for long-term optimism.</p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">For the species to be categorised as Critically Endangered in the future (criteria A), an 80% decline over c. 15 years would be required, which would be likely to entail, assuming a stable Manipur subpopulation, the complete loss of Eld’s Deer populations from the remaining (one or two) sites in Lao PDR, and local extinctions from all but one protected area population in each of Cambodia and Myanmar. This scenario has not occurred, yet is possible but, perhaps, not likely. and therefore we maintain the previous assessment of Endangered. Regular monitoring of both rates of habitat loss and the status of core populations in both Cambodia and Myanmar is of critical importance for this species</span></p>","<p><span lang=""EN-US"">Populations in Lao PDR, Viet Nam and Cambodia seems to have occurred in a variety of primarily open, grass dominated habitats. Most evidence of presence comes from Deciduous Dipterocarp Forests which primarily occur in the highly monsoonal areas of the Mekong plains (Wharton 1957, Tordoff <em>et al.</em> 2005, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008), but historical populations known from, for instance, the Nakai and Bolaven plateaux of Lao PDR appear to have used a mosaic of small grasslands and wetlands amongst pine, semi-evergreen and other forest types, and those known from the Dalat and Kirirom plateaux would seemingly have occurred in more extensive pine/savanna habitats (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). The species may also have occurred in northern Lao PDR, where suitable habitat is localised to a few plains amid the generally unsuitable rugged densely forested terrain but no conclusive records have been traced (Duckworth <em>et al. </em>1999), and would have presumably inhabited Mixed Deciduous Forests and grasslands of anthropogenic origin, (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Populations in deciduous Dipterocarp Forest appear to favour open-canopy formations, with grass dominated understory, especially areas with extensive grassland patches, and avoid closed-canopy formations where small deciduous bamboos predominate in the understory (Timmins and Ou 2001, Timmins <em>et al.</em> 2003, Tordoff <em>et al.</em> 2005, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, Gray <em>et al. </em>2012, T. Gray pers. comm. 2013). Given the highly seasonal nature of such forest areas, permanent wetlands, usually in the form of forest pools or stream bed pools, are likely to be very significant to the species and the densities of animals that a given area can support (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008; T. Gray pers. comm. 2013). Despite suggestions to the contrary in some sources, there is no evidence that Eld’s Deer in these countries are particularly wetland associated, nor is there evidence that the species reached high densities in floodplain tall grasslands (contrary to the case with hog deer) (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). </p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">The grasslands that the species appears often to associate with are favoured over forest for conversion to rice paddies, and the paddies likewise appear attractive to the deer (T. Gray pers. comm. 2013). </span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">Males appear to be fond of wallowing. Anecdotal evidence suggests that deer do not make substantial movements and tend to remain year round within relatively small areas (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). At Ang Trapaeng Thmor Conservation Area deer are forced to disperse, during the wet-season, from flooded grassland and agricultural areas around a reservoir where breeding occurs, into adjacent areas of decidious Dipterocarp Forest (S. Mahood pers. comm. 2013). Lekagul and McNeely (1988) suggested that Eld’s Deer had been driven into drier areas by hunting and habitat destruction. However, this is clearly not the case in Cambodia where historically Eld’s Deer were considered one of the most abundant species in the open seasonally very dry forests of the north and east (Wharton 1957). </p>  <p>The Loktak lake population in Manipur, India, inhabits an area of floating marsh called locally ‘phumdi’ (Singh 1983, 2004). This population has adaptations of the feet which are thought to help the animals move easily in their marshland habitat (Pocock 1943), but Pocock (1943) speculated that elsewhere in north-east India Eld’s Deer would also have occupied drier plains.&#160;</p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">In Myanmar most Eld’s Deer occur in indaing forest, which is usually dominated by the tree <em>Dipterocarpus tuberculatus</em>, and is structurally and ecologically fairly equivalent to the Deciduous Dipterocarp Forest of Indochina and Thailand. There are two other types of deciduous forests used by the deer in Myanmar, dry (thandahat), and mixed (teak). All three forest types receive 100-200 cm of rainfall a year (Prescott 1987; Bronson 1989; McShea <em>et al. </em>1999, 2001; Myint Aung <em>et al.</em> 2001). Pristine habitat is now absent within the Myanmar range of Eld’s Deer and all populations use habitats at various stages of secondary succession (McShea <em>et al. </em>2005).</span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">The ecology of animals in Myanmar is likely to be similar to those in Indochina and Thailand reflecting the similarities in habitat, with dry-season movement closely correlated with the locations of water sources (Prescott 1987; McShea <em>et al. </em>1999, 2001). At the Hlawga wildlife park just outside Yangon, Myanmar, many species of Myanmar’s native wildlife have been introduced. In contrast to Hog Deer, Sambar and Northern Red Muntjac, which have all increased to good populations, Eld’s Deer has failed to establish itself within this small fenced area. This is attributed by staff, including a past veterinarian, to the area being too humid (it is said to be outside the native range of Eld’s Deer) although this has not been confirmed.</p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">The typical habitat of ‘Eld’s Deer in Hainan Island is scrubland and dry grassland together with sparse trees in hills below 200 m asl in altitude (Zeng <em>et al. </em>2005). </span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">Eld’s Deer feeds on grass and some browse and also take fallen fruits and flowers, and reportedly can live without water for several days. Eld’s Deer regularly visits salt licks. Stags are generally solitary except during the rut, while hinds congregate throughout most of the year (Gee 1961, Myint Aung pers. comm. 1996). Wharton (1957) recorded large herds in Cambodia in the 1950s, and Lekagul and McNeely (1988) stated that, prior to hunting reductions, herds of over 50 formed. In Keibul Lamjao National Park, <em>R. e. eldii </em>is thought to move from the ‘phumdi’ to island hillocks during periods of flooding (Green 1990). In China, the rut is during February-June, with a single fawn born from September to January. In India, calving occurs from mid-October to the end of December. Gestation period is between 237 and 240 days, and sexual maturity is reached at approximately 1.5-2.0 years (Wemmer and Grodinsky 1988).</p>","<p><span lang=""EN-US"">In Cambodia, Lao PDR and Viet Nam the most obvious threat to Eld’s Deer is hunting, which in addition to local consumption of meat is driven by a thriving and probably increasing trade in bushmeat, a national, regional and East Asian market for traditional medicinal products derived from the species, and a regional international market for trophy antlers (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1999, Timmins and Ou 2001, Tordoff <em>et al. </em>2005, Zeng <em>et al. </em>2005). However since 2010 large-scale habitat loss and conversion of Deciduous Dipterocarp Forest for Economic and Social Land Concessions, which also increased hunting pressure, has become an equally significant threat in Cambodia. In addition the highly fragmented nature and small population size of the remaining subpopulations makes the species’ perhaps vulnerable to small population threats.</p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">The influence of traditional medicinal trade is uncertain, but may be very significant as products derived from the species are reportedly more valuable than are those from other deer (Zeng <em>et al.</em> 2005). Some hunting in Cambodia is probably also driven by a demand for captive animals especially from zoos and menageries in Thailand and Cambodia (Salter and Sayer 1986, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). The species is apparently easy to hunt compared with other sympatric deer, and fawns are likely to be very vulnerable to dogs which almost always accompany human parties during forest visits, even when the visits are not for hunting (Tordoff <em>et al.</em> 2005, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Predation of fawns by domestic dogs, which are ubiquitous within dry forests in lowland Indochina, has been identified as a threat to the Savannakhet subpopulation in Lao PDR (P. Vongkhamheng pers. comm. 2013) and may also impact the scattered Cambodian subpopulations particularly those outside the cores of protected areas. The effects of hunting have been exacerbated by forest loss and fragmentation, which is rapidly accelerating with human population in-migration, infrastructural developments (especially roads), commercial agricultural expansion, economic land speculation and mineral extraction. Selective logging was initially one of the main driving forces, but it is now of relatively minor concern (Tordoff <em>et al.</em> 2005, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Human in-migration and subsequent agricultural encroachment into forest areas tends to concentrate on those habitats most used by Eld’s Deer, and thus the species has suffered more than most from hunting (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, Tordoff <em>et al. </em>2005). In-migration is also a commonly associated with land concessions in Cambodia. Indeed the loss of considerable (~500 km<sup>2</sup>) Eld’s Deer habitat in Preah Vihear province in 2011-12 was associated with a Social Land Concession given to military families. As an inhabitant of relatively open habitat through which travel and transport are easy, it is also likely to have been more heavily affected by a given level of hunting effort compared with species of rugged, dense hill evergreen forest; a similar scenario has been postulated for Jungle Cat <em>Felis chaus</em> (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 2005, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). </span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">Probably the most significant challenge to conserving the species in Lao PDR, Cambodia and Viet Nam is the uncertainty involved with long-term protected-area based conservation management. No protected areas within Cambodia are safe from conversion to other land-uses. Protected areas, even those that at present have relatively active and effective management, face an uncertain future with the possibility of excision of conservation status largely for land concessions, the lack of long-term security in external funding adequate to maintain high standards of management, fluctuations in political support necessary to uphold high protection standards and the consequential difficulties of maintaining a motivated and well-trained staff. </p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">Protected areas, primarily those along the tri-border area of Thailand where it adjoins both Lao PDR and Cambodia, and the Huai Kha Khaeng WS, were unable to prevent the decline and likely extirpation of Eld’s Deer from the wild in Thailand (see Bhumpakphan<em> et al. </em>2004). This decline was likely to have been driven by much the same reasons as in Indochina. If any Eld’s Deer do remain in the wild there, it seems unlikely that they will ever recover unassisted. There are few data on the introduced populations of <em>R. e. thamin</em> to non-native areas (see Bhumpakphan <em>et al. </em>2004).</span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">Threats to the species in Myanmar appear to be similar to those in Indochina, with perhaps more emphasis on exploitation for meat (Salter and Sayer 1986, Myint Aung pers. comm. 1997). </p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">Habitat loss in some range areas is still ongoing (Myint Aung 2004) and Koy <em>et al. </em>(2005) found that ‘patterns of percentage tree canopy-cover were negatively correlated with human population density, suggesting further threats to Eld's Deer populations as the human population continues to grow’. </span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">A support programme for the main site, Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary, had an encouraging start but following cessation of external funding the population is now in decline (see Population), while other protected areas in the country either failed to include appropriate habitat for the species (e.g. Alaungdaw Kathapa National Park) or failed to protect the habitat even within the protected area (e.g. Shwesettaw Wildlife Sanctuary). </p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">Overall, the challenges of generating functional protected areas which will sustain Eld’s Deer are similar to, and under current conditions even more daunting than, those outlined for Cambodia, Lao PDR and Viet Nam (above). In general, protected areas in Myanmar are themselves highly threatened by major shortfalls in funding and political will (Rao <em>et al.</em> 2002).</span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">The population on Hainan faces an uncertain future as a wild animal without hands-on management, because protected area management has not been effective in preventing poaching (see Pang <em>et al.</em> 2003, Zeng <em>et al. </em>2005). Loss of suitable habitat has been extensive and is continuing, but large enough areas probably remain for further population expansion, provided that herds in such situations could be adequately protected from poaching (see Zeng<em> et al.</em> 2005). Genetic analyses of the population suggest that there is low diversity resulting from a population bottleneck, and this could in the future threaten the population’s viability (Pang <em>et al.</em> 2003, Balakrishnan <em>et al.</em> 2003).</p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">Indian populations of Eld’s Deer declined due to some combination of hunting and habitat loss. Even at the Keibul Lamjao National Park, the habitats of the deer have been encroached for grazing, cultivation, and fish farming (Green 1990), but this seems to be mainly now under control (Singh 2004). This population is now most threatened by a hydro-electric project in Loktak Lake which maintains unnaturally high water levels during the dry season and has changed water flow patterns and water quality in the lake (Singh 2004). These in turn appear to be affecting the ecology of the Keibul Lamjao National Park floating marsh (Singh 2004, Sanjit <em>et al.</em> 2005). Floods could also seriously affect the population, which has no high ground to which it can easily escape (Singh 2004). There may also be the threat of low genetic diversity resulting from the effect of a very small founder population (Balakrishnan <em>et al</em>. 2004) and as a small isolated population it must also be considered at risk from disease transfer from domestic livestock, and potentially other factors.</span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">Eld’s Deer readily grazes on rice and some other agricultural products (McShea and Myint Aung 2001). This provides some potential for human-wildlife conflict, but under current conditions populations seem to be too low for this to be a serious problem (e.g. at the Chonbuly district population, Savannakhet province, Lao PDR; J.W. Duckworth in litt. 2008). Retributory killing may become more of a threat if populations are successfully rebuilt in areas close to agriculture.</p>","Based on both habitat extent and size of remaining patches, Myanmar and Cambodia are the pre-eminent countries for Eld's Deer (McShea <em>et al</em>. 2005). However, the actual status of remaining populations is more related to hunting levels.<br/><p><span lang=""EN-US"">In Cambodia declines since the late 1950s, when large herds were still readily seen (Wharton 1957), have been dramatic. In the first decade of the 21st century the species declined by 90% or more, given comparisons of aerial counts in 1994 with ground survey results from 1998 to 2008 (Olivier and Woodford 1994, Timmins and Ou 2001, Timmins <em>et al.</em> 2003, R.J Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Eld’s Deer may still occur over a relatively wide area, although localised within this, surviving as small remnant groups in the lowland forests of the north and east. The 2008 account suggested the total Cambodian population “could well be several thousand animals in a forest area that probably exceeds 20,000 km<sup>2</sup>”. However the current population is more likely &lt;700 individuals in a number of functionally isolated subpopulations despite remaining habitat. As a result of the scattered nature of the small Eld’s Deer subpopulations across northern and eastern Cambodia few occur within the cores of managed protected areas.&#160;</p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">Survey work in appropriate habitat between 1998 and 2008 detected subpopulations in at least 15 separate areas, with anecdotal evidence from several more areas (McShea <em>et al. </em>2005, Tordoff <em>et al</em>. 2005, Bird <em>et al.</em> 2006, Timmins 2006, Bezuijen <em>et al.</em> in press). A few may remain in the southwest, although there is little evidence other than for one small subpopulation in the Phnom Aural area which persisted until at least the late 1990s (Henshaw<em> et al.</em> 2002, Tordoff <em>et al.</em> 2005), but there is no more recent information. Gray <em>et al. </em>(2012) reviewed camera-trap data from eastern Cambodia between 1999 and 2007 and documented Eld’s Deer records from five of nine survey sites. However in three of these (Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary, areas of Seima Protected Forest and adjacent Snoul Wildlife Sanctuary and unprotected forest close to Prey Khieu at the Mondulkiri-Stung Treng provincial border) recent (post-2008) and extensive habitat loss is likely to have resulted in subpopulation extirpation.</span></p><p>Recent robust distance-based line transect surveys in a number of protected areas which support, or supported, the species (Mondulkiri Protected Forest, Seima Protection Forest, Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary, Preah Vihear Protected Forest and Kulen Promtep Wildlife Sanctuary) failed to detect sufficient Eld’s Deer for population estimation c.f. another globally threatened large ungulate in the landscape banteng Bos javancius (O’Kelly <em>et al. </em>2012, Gray <em>et al.</em> 2013, S. Mahood pers. comm. 2014).&#160;</p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">Only the subpopulations in Mondulkiri Protected Forest (~50-75 individuals) and Kulen Promtep Wildlife Sanctuary/Preah Vihear Protected Forest (probably a similar size to that in Mondulkiri Protected Forest) are likely resident year-round within a relatively well-patrolled and secured protected area. Numbers in western Siem Pang, Stung Treng province may be higher than previously suspected (BirdLife International Cambodia 2012) but the subpopulation, of between 50-150 individuals, occurs at a site directly threatened through ongoing conversion to Economic Land Concessions. At Ang Trapaeng Thmor Sarus Crane Conservation Area, Banteay Meanchey province, the subpopulation of 30-50 individuals disperses out of the protected area into community forestry during the wet-season (S. Mahood pers. comm. 2014).&#160;</p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US""><em>R. e. thamin</em> was still relatively widespread and abundant during the mid-1980s on the plains of central and northern Myanmar, where its range centred on the Irrawaddy Plain, including the Bago or Sittang Plain to the east. It was said to be present to the southeast, along the Thai border (Salter and Sayer 1986), and along the western border with Bangladesh (Lekagul and McNeely 1977), but these records are doubtful and a questionnaire in 1992 and surveys in 1997 could only find evidence for the species in the northeast (McShea<em> et al.</em> 2000). In 1992 a countrywide questionnaire was distributed by the then Wildlife Department of Myanmar, this resulted in reports of Eld’s Deer from 28 Myanmar townships, and 2,200 Eld’s Deer were estimated to remain within Myanmar, with the largest population (over 1,200 deer) in Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary (Myint Aung 1994, McShea <em>et al.</em> 2000). Regular transect surveys in Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary between 1983 and 1996 indicated a population decline of upwards of 40% (McShea <em>et al. </em>2000), with a population estimated at about 500 deer in the latter years (Myint Aung pers. comm. 1996). More recent evidence indicates a continued decline at this site and the population is likely now to be considerably below 100 individuals (W.J. McShea in litt. 2014).</span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">A nationwide survey of Myanmar in 1997 found evidence of Eld’s Deer within 23 of 24 townships surveyed, out of the 28 that were reported to contain Eld’s Deer in 1992. The four un-surveyed townships were considered very unlikely to still harbour deer because of the little remaining habitat within them (McShea <em>et al.</em> 2000). By 2003 a repeat of the 1992 surveys concluded that deer had disappeared from four townships and had declined in at least another four, but there were signs that in some townships populations were stable or even increasing (Myint Aung 2004). However, surveys in 2007 found Eld’s Deer in only 14 townships and had therefore seriously declined. Increases and decreases were in part put down to reforestation efforts and habitat loss respectively (Myint Aung 2004). More recent, anecdotal, assessment of habitat quality indicates considerable loss of lowland deciduous forest throughout central Myanmar in the last 10 years (W.J. McShea in litt. 2014). At Shwesettaw Wildlife Sanctuary, favourable habitat has been taken over by agriculture however more recent information suggests that the site may now hold the most significant Eld’s Deer population in the country with at least 200 individuals noted in 2004 (W.J. McShea in litt. 2014).&#160;</p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary was described in the 2008 assessment as “now the only viable population with nominal protection, and habitat currently appears more secure” however the assessors ominously noted that “protection efforts appear to be failing, at least partly reflecting changes in management. Since funding from the Smithsonian Institution ceased in 2003, the amount of patrolling and the Eld’s Deer population have decreased every year (W. McShea pers. comm. 2008); a causal link seems inescapable”. More recent, ad-hoc, observations support this conclusion and it is likely that Eld’s Deer populations in Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary have declined &gt;50% in the past 10 years.&#160;</span></p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">Two populations detected on the outskirts of Alaungdaw Kathapa National Park and Mahamyaing Wildlife Sanctuary were&#160; never protected by inclusion in the&#160; parks, and elsewhere in the country other populations and large blocks of suitable habitat have not been gazetted into the protected area system despite hopes that they would be (McShea <em>et al. </em>2000, W. McShea pers. comm. 2008).&#160;</p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">In Lao PDR there are one or two known populations. One (of probably under 50 animals) is in Savannakhet province (central Lao PDR) and has been the focus of a community led species-specific conservation project, with regular subjective monitoring of the population (Johnson <em>et al. </em>2004, A. Johnson pers. comm. 2007, T. Gray pers. comm. 2013). However this monitoring is not able to effectively estimate population size or trends.. In the late 1990s another small subpopulation, of probably the low dozens of animals, was found from Champasak Province, far south-western Lao PDR, in areas adjacent to the Dong Khanthung Provincial Protected Area, but there has been no recent re-evaluation of the site and it is quite plausible that the species has been hunted out there (Round 1998, Duckworth <em>et al. </em>1999, A. Johnson pers. comm. 2007, R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). It is unlikely, given the distribution of suitable habitat, the distribution of the human population, and the pervasive hunting culture in Lao PDR that any more significant populations of the species remain to be found (R.J. Timmins pers. obs.); lowland Savannakhet province was the only unprotected part of Lao PDR where in Duckworth <em>et al</em>. (1999: 41) recommended additional surveys of large mammals as likely to reveal new conservation priorities. One subpopulation was indeed found but since that was written, options for others have greatly declined due to extensive road-building, conversion of remaining dry forest habitat and assignment of much of the rest to plantation concessions (particularly on the western plains of the province) and continued extremely high levels of trade-driven large mammal hunting make the chances of any others remaining now very low (J.W. Duckworth in litt. 2008 from field assessment in late 2007).</span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">Survival in Viet Nam is now very doubtful. Eld’s Deer was still reported by local inhabitants in the early 2000’s (e.g. as reported in Nguyen Xuan Dang and Nguyen Thi Thuy (2004), but field surveys of such areas have failed to find the species (Do Tuoc pers. comm. 2006). Perhaps a few animals remain along the border with Cambodia (Do Tuoc pers. comm. 2006), but repeated recent surveys of one of the more promising areas, Yok Don National Park, has not produced good evidence (Le Xuan Canh <em>et al.</em> 1997, Eames<em> et al.</em> 2004). The reported distributions given by Dang Huy Huynh (1990) and Ratajszczak (1991) were either overly optimistic and based on unverified evidence, or indicate a recent swift decline in the species in Viet Nam; probably both factors are responsible.</p>  <p>Continued presence of ancestral wild populations in Thailand is also now very unlikely. At best a few remnant individuals may survive or immigrate. The Thai Royal Forestry Department has a captive breeding programme for both <em>R. e. thamin</em> and <em>R. e. eldii</em> and there have been attempts at introduction of the former in two areas (where it was never a native subspecies); numbers living in a ‘wild state’ are in the low tens (Naris Bhumpakphan <em>et al</em>. 2004).&#160;</p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">Although once distributed in the tropical zone of southwest Yunnan and further east, the South China Eld’s Deer has long been extirpated (Smith and Xie 2008<span lang=""EN-US"">, Zeng <em>et al.</em> 2005). By the 1970s the only remaining Chinese populations were on Hainan and had declined to some 40 animals in Dong Fang and Bai Sha Counties, primarily due to poaching, from a reported 500 individuals in 1950s (Zeng <em>et al.</em> 2005). In 1976 two protected areas, the Datian Nature Reserve, and the Bangxi NR, West Hainan, were founded around the two last remaining isolated herds of deer, with 26 and 20 animals respectively (Song and Zeng 2004, Pang <em>et al.</em> 2003, Zeng <em>et al. </em>2005). By 1981 the Bangxi NR population had been exterminated by poaching (Zeng <em>et al</em>. 2005). The animals in Datian NR were kept in fenced enclosures while the population grew, and at the current time the whole c. 13 km<sup>2</sup> of the reserve is enclosed (Song 1996, Pang <em>et al.</em> 2003, Zeng <em>et al. </em>2005). Initial problems with conservation efforts at Datian included encroachment of almost half its habitat by agriculture since its establishment, deer deaths through drought and overcrowding in small enclosures, and some poaching (Pang <em>et al. </em>2003, Zeng <em>et al</em>. 2005). By 1991 the Chinese population had rebounded to 346 animals, of which 261 were within the Datian Nature Reserve (Yuan <em>et al. </em>1993). By 2003 there were about 1,000 animals in Datian NR, and beginning in 1986 captive and semi-wild populations were established at other facilities, the total population in which was approximately 260 animals in 2003 (Song and Zeng 2004, Zeng <em>et al.</em> 2005). A semi-wild herd was founded once again in Bangxi NR, and by 2002 the population there was reportedly 115 animals (Zeng <em>et al</em>. 2005). In 2003 a third ‘wild’ herd was founded in Mihouling Reserve (Song and Zeng 2004, Zeng <em>et al. </em>2005).&#160;</span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">In India, <em>R. e. eldii </em>was thought to be extinct in the early 1950s but was subsequently rediscovered. By 1975, the only remaining wild population had declined to about 14 animals in the swamps of Loktak Lake, Manipur (Ranjitsinh 1978). On this basis, a floating marsh on the southern end of Loktak Lake was gazetted in 1977 as the Keibul Lamjao National Park (Ranjitsinh 1978). During 2006-2008, Eld’s Deer presence was recorded in a 21.5 - 22.7 km<sup>2</sup> area of the Keibul Lamjao National Park. Higher dung density was recorded from &gt;9.0 ± 0.18&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;area of the Park. The point count method used for population monitoring revealed the estimated density of 4.04, 4.08 and 4.05 individuals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;during 2006, 2007 and 2008 respectively, with a minimum of 2.97 individual per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;and maximum of 6.01 individuals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;at 95% confidence level. This yields the estimated mean population size as 91, 88 and 92 individuals during 2006, 2007 and 2008 respectively, with a minimum of 60 and maximum of 136 Sangai at 95% confidence level. This indicates that the population of Sangai in the Park is more or less stable (Hussain <em>et al.</em> 2009).&#160;</span></p>",Decreasing,"This species was formerly widely distributed across suitable habitats of South and Southeast Asia, from the Manipur region of northeastern India through much of Myanmar, Thailand, Lao PDR, Cambodia, and Viet Nam to the island of Hainan (China) in the east (Salter and Sayer 1986, Grubb 2005). The historical range was broken into four major components, consisting of the Manipur region of India inhabited by <em>R. e. eldii</em>; <em>R. e. thamin</em> on the central plains of Myanmar; <em>R. e. siamensis</em> populations in the lowlands of Thailand, Cambodia, Lao PDR and Viet Nam (separated by the mountains along the Thai-Myanmar border from <em>R. e. thamin</em>); and the population on Hainan and former populations in mainland southern China, which appear to have been disjunct outliers of <em>R. e. siamensis</em>, separated from its main range by mountainous terrain in Lao PDR and Viet Nam.<br/><br/>The global Eld's Deer population is currently very localized to small areas within the species' former range. <em>R. e. eldii</em> is now confined to a single small population at the southern end of Loktak Lake in Manipur, India (Singh 2004). <em>R. e. thamin</em> still occurs in several localised areas of central Myanmar, as well as there being introduced populations in Thailand (McShea <em>et al</em>. 2000, Aung 2004, Naris Bhumpakphan <em>et al</em>. 2004). <em>R. e. siamensis</em> occurs in one or two small localised populations in Lao PDR (Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2004), and as scattered small subpopulations mainly in the northern and eastern lowlands of Cambodia (Tordoff <em>et al</em>. 2005), and occurs in a relatively wild state in one protected area on Hainan, with additionally several other managed herds on that island (Pang <em>et al</em>. 2003).","Eld's Deer is hunted for food and other purposes. There are many captive animals, the uses of these other than for breeding stock are unknown.",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"This species is listed on CITES Appendix I. Although most Cambodian Eld’s Deer are within protected areas few occur within government approved Core Zones (Timmins <em>et al.</em> 2003, McShea<em> et al.</em> 2005, Tordoff <em>et al. </em>2005, Timmins 2006). The recent loss, or substantial decline of subpopulations in, and around, Seima Protected Forest, Phnom Prich and Snoul Wildlife Sanctuaries, and O’Yadao Protected Forest due to conversion to land concessions largely occurred because these subpopulations were on the edge of protected areas, close to villages, and in areas where conversion to other land-uses was difficult to prevent.Conservation management of the Kulen Wildlife Sanctuary, Preah Vihear Protection Forest, and, particularly, Ang Trapaeng Thmor Sarus Crane Conservation Area and Mondulkiri Protected Forest may be stabilising and perhaps even increasing Eld’s Deer populations, through externally funded conservation management projects supported by the Wildlife Conservation Society and The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF unpublished data, WCS unpublished data, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, T. Gray pers. comm. 2013, S. Mahood pers. comm. 2013). However evidence of increasing Eld’s Deer populations does not exist and recent intensive line-transects surveys have not detected sufficient individuals for robust population size estimation. These five areas cover well over 3,000 km<sup>2</sup> of relatively suitable Eld’s Deer habitat, and thus the most pressing conservation need is the continued support and consolidation of these protected areas. Only once this is in place would it be sensible to divert resources to protect Eld’s Deer in further areas of Cambodia currently with little to no active protection. However the intensities of law enforcement within these sites is highly variable and dependent upon both external non-governmental financial and technical support and political buy-in from governments. For example the temporary removal of provincial police from supporting patrolling activities in Mondulkiri Protected Forest in 2011 by provincial authorities resulted in at least one documented Eld’s Deer poaching event and a considerable influx of general illegal activity across the protected area.  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">An additional conservation action within the core zone of Mondulkiri Protected Forest is the artificial deepening of natural waterholes (trapaeng in Khmer) to ensure year-round water availability, which is also planned for Preah Vihear Protected Forest and Kulen Promtep Wildlife Sanctuary (S. Mahood pers. comm.). Research has indicated the majority of trapaeng are dry in the height of the dry-season and trapaeng deepening has been demonstrated to maintain enhance water retention and provide dry-season water access to Eld’s Deer and other threatened species (T. Gray pers. comm. 2014 and unpublished manuscript).</p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">The central Lao population in Chonbuly District, Savannakhet Province, is under nominal protection in a roughly 200 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;provincial protected area specifically designated for the species (Johnson <em>et al.</em> 2004). The area had an ongoing conservation management project supported by the Wildlife Conservation Society (Johnson <em>et al.</em> 2004) which since 2009 has been resumed by WWF with support of the Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund (T. Gray pers. comm. 2014). The single southern Lao population found during extensive surveys in the 1990s was small and inhabited a mosaic of farmland amidst forest, adjacent to a subsequently declared provincial protected area (Round 1998). Attempts to upgrade the provincial protected area to national status have failed (A. Johnson pers. comm. 2007)..</span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">In Thailand the protected area system failed to prevent the species' effective national extinction some years ago. Therefore, recent conservation efforts there have focused on the captive breeding of large numbers of <em>R. e. thamin</em> (see Bhumpakphan <em>et al.</em> 2004), which is not, however, native to most of Thailand. Attempts to introduce <em>R. e. thamin</em> to non-native areas have had limited success, although there is a residual herd at Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary and Propagation Station (Bhumpakphan<em> et al. </em>2004). Forty-five individuals were reintroduced into Huai Kha Khaeng WS and approximately 20 deer to Wang Lor Wildlife Sanctuary but then the programme was discontinued (W. McShea pers. comm. 2014). <em>R. e. siamensis</em> was the subject of an abortive Smithsonian Institution reintroduction program initiated in 1985. By 1989, progress was limited to construction of holding facilities at Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary and Propagation Station. As with other range states the most pressing conservation measures seem to be strengthening protected area management in those areas that cover the species' former range, so that reintroduction might be possible in the future, jointly with measures to align all stakeholders to ensure that introduction programmes do not create herds with a mix of <em>R. e. siamensis</em> and <em>R. e. thamin</em> ancestry.</p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">The Hainan population is now highly managed with most of the population in Datian NR, and other animals in Bangxi NR and Mihouling Reserve, and other captive facilities (Zeng <em>et al.</em> 2005). The species has been the subject of various avenues of research, for instance a population viability analysis was undertaken to examine demographic and environmental (drought) challenges to the two enclosed populations at the Hainan Datian Nature Reserve (Song 1996), with other research by Yuan <em>et al</em>. (1993) and Song (1993) (see also Zeng <em>et al.</em> 2005). But, the most important conservation measure needed appears to be strengthening of the protected area system so that deer can be re-established in a wild state without danger of poaching or habitat encroachment (see Zeng <em>et al.</em> 2005).</span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">India held 97 captive animals in 15 zoos in December 1992, a slight decline from over 100 in the mid-1980s (Decoux 1993); by 1994, 14 zoos held 107 animals (Sharma 1994). The population is probably inbred: all reportedly are descended from two founder pairs (Walker and Marimuthu 1991, see also Balakrishnan <em>et al. </em>2003). The 40&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;Keibul Lamjao National Park was gazetted in 1977 specifically to protect <em>R. e. eldii</em> (Ranjitsinh 1978). Subsequently projects at the park have raised public awareness, and local support has been developed for conserving the endemic Manipur subspecies, and largely halted encroachment of the species habitat (Singh 2004). Status surveys of <em>R. e. eldii </em>have been carried out annually in Keibul Lamjao National Park since 1975 (Ranjitsinh 1996, Singh 2004), and research has been undertaken by Singh (1983, 2004). A Wildlife Institute of India proposal in the 1980s to establish a second free-ranging population in Assam (Khan <em>et al.</em> 1993) was not implemented. Conservation needs are essentially mitigating detrimental effects of the hydropower project on the park, strengthening the protected area management of the park (e.g. through even further improvement of local relations and capacity building), increasing the park’s area to meet the needs of deer through appropriate research and potentially establishing further wild populations in other areas.</p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">In Myanmar, Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary and Shwesettaw Wildlife Sanctuary were established specifically to protect <em>R. e. thamin</em> (Salter and Sayer 1986), but little management has been undertaken and despite promising initial efforts, management effectiveness appears to be decreasing (Myint Aung 1990, W.J. McShea pers. comm. 2008). Deer were found on the outskirts of two other protected areas&#160; Alaungdaw Kathapa National Park and Mahamyaing Wildlife Sanctuary, but protection efforts were never extended to cover the appropriate area, and the majority of the remnant area occupied by the species are likely to be outside protected areas (McShea <em>et al.</em> 2000, W. McShea pers. comm. 2008). A number of reintroductions have taken place into enclosed sites such as Hlawga Wildlife Park, using animals from Rangoon Zoo and the wild. In 1995, an ecological study of radio-collared <em>R. e. thamin</em> was initiated in Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary by the Smithsonian Institution, and a community education project commenced later that year to raise local awareness of the deer and the wildlife sanctuary (Wemmer 1995). The Wildlife Division surveys the population annually using a basic line transect method. Conservation measures needed were recently assessed to include extending the protected areas network (McShea<em> et al.</em> 2000) but in the interim the most pressing needs seem to be to prevent further deterioration at Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary and to salvage the Shwesettaw Wildlife Sanctuary, if this is possible.</span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">McShea <em>et al.</em> (2005) argued that ""only Cambodia, with 11% suitable forest protected, has placed sufficient dry dipterocarp forest under protected status. Other Southeast Asia countries have not recognized dry dipterocarp forest as a significant ecotype worthy of conservation status"". It is certainly true that this forest type has been seen as a low priority in the conservation planning of all range states, but consideration that a country has placed 'sufficient' of any habitat type under protected status is subjective and a variety of measures can be used. In this case, 'sufficiency' was judged on the basis of proportion of a country's total suitable habitat that has been nominally protected. An alternative would be to consider factors like the actual amount of protected habitat, and whether this is enough to represent the range of biotic variation within the country; whether such habitat is in large enough blocks to remain ecologically functional into the long term, and whether protection is largely nominal or is genuinely effective. The last dichotomy is likely to be the chief determinant of whether Eld's deer will survive. Considering that no range states yet have existing protected areas which have secured the species on a long-term footing (although there are promising developments in several countries), and considering the speed with which populations can decrease, priority is necessary at present to concentrate most conservation actions for Eld’s Deer on securing existing protected areas for key populations which have real potential for success. This has become increasingly urgent given the accelerating threats to lowland deciduous dipterocarp forest in Cambodia both outside, and within, protected areas. Determining this potential will reflect situational factors as much or more than ‘traditional’ biological factors such as current Eld’s Deer status within them. Eld’s Deer could potentially persist in habitat mosaics of forest and agriculture, as they still do in some areas of Myanmar and Cambodia (McShea <em>et al. </em>2000, T. D. Evans pers. comm. 2007), but cultural predisposition to hunting and competing land uses make it unlikely that poaching can be controlled, or habitat management developed, without the context of a protected area, in most range countries (India and perhaps Myanmar being the most likely exceptions).</p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">There are large captive populations of the species, estimated in 2003 to number 180 <em>R. e. eldii</em>, 1,100 <em>R. e. thamin</em>, 23 <em>R. e. siamensis</em> (non-Hainan stock) and 280 <em>R. e. siamensis</em> (Hainan stock), but most captive groups are not managed with conservation in mind (Siriaroonrat 2004). There is some scope for using these animals in reintroduction programmes, particularly in Thailand where Eld’s Deer is nationally extinct yet the country is now probably in ‘the best financial and administrative position’ of all range states to conserve landscape-scale field populations of the species (McShea <em>et al. </em>2005).</span></p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

They are the only sirenians restricted to freshwater systems.&#160;<em>T. inunguis</em>&#160;occurs in waters with temperatures above 23<sup>o</sup>C (Gallivan <em>et al.</em> 1983), living in the three types of water in Amazonian rivers (white, black and clear), being more abundant in white waters, where there is greater primary production (Best 1984, Rosas 1994).</p><p>Individuals engage in long seasonal movements, moving from flooded areas during the wet season to deep water bodies during the dry season (Arraut <em>et al.</em> 2010, Kendall <em>et al.</em> 2014).

Although no specific studies are available for the species in the wild, it is believed that the reproductive cycle is similar to the West Indian Manatee’s, with a long gestation and lactation period (up to 24 months), and a birthing interval of 2 to 3 years (Best 1983); age at sexual maturity is suggested to be between 6 and 10 years (Rodrigues <em>et al.</em> 2002).</p>  <p>Generation length is 25 years, based on what is known for <em>T. manatus.</em></p>","<p>The commercial large scale capture of Amazonian Manatee was the main reason for the reduction of the populations of the species. The main current threats for Manatees are hunting for meat consumption (Denkinger 2010, Brice <em>et al.</em> 2011, Utreras <em>et al.</em> 2013, Sandoval 2015), entanglement in fishing nets and habitat alterations.</p>  <p><em>Illegal hunting</em>, for both subsistence and local use, is considered the main threat to Manatees in the Amazon. Manatee populations have supported a tremendous take in past centuries and, although not at commercial levels, hunting still takes place throughout the region (Barbosa <em>et al. </em>2010a, b; Franzini <em>et al. </em>2013; Silva <em>et al. </em>2014; M. Marmontel pers. obs). Most hunting is practiced with the use of traditional harpoons, but in Ecuador Manatees may be caught in traps set for <em>Arapaima</em> (Hidalgo 2010).</p>  <p>Hunters usually sell products to neighbors and nearby communities, but the meat is sometimes sold in local produce fairs or markets in the interior, or by order directly with the hunter. Public markets in Brazil (Manaus, Manacapuru, Beruri, Novo Airão, Tefé, Silves, Itapiranga, Itacoatiara, Santarém, Belém, Monte Alegre and Almeirim, Benjamin Constant, Atalaia do Norte) and Ecuador also illegally offer the meat for sale. Meat is sold in natura, or as ""mixira"" or subproducts such as sausage. The mixira, which is the meat preserved in its own fat, is one of the products that prolongs the pressure on the species, since it commands a high price.</p>  <p>Take estimates are available only for a few sites where conservation and research projects are taking place. Between 2002 and 2004, 64 Manatees were estimated to have been killed in the Amanã-Castanho area (3,000 km<sup>2</sup>) of Amanã SDR (Calvimontes 2009), most of them adult males. Between 2011 and 2015, the hunt count for the same area was 42 Manatees. Some 195 Manatees were estimated to have been killed between 2011 and 2015 in the Uatumã River valley (Brazil) through the expeditions of Project Protecting Life in Uatumã (S.M. Lazzarini pers. comm. 2016). In the Urucu region of Brazil 20 Manatees were captured between 2004 and 2007, 14 harpooned and 6 entangled (Franzini <em>et al.</em> 2013). Pantoja (2015) estimated 92 Manatees hunted in the area of the lower Javari river, Brazil, between 1980 and 2014. Based on interviews conducted in the Piagaçu Purus SDR (Purus river, Brazil), approximately 460 Manatees were killed in the protected area between 2004 and 2014 (Souza <em>et al. </em>2014).&#160;Based on 48 interviews, 36 manatees were captured in the Region of the Middle Madeira and Aripuanã Rivers (Amazon, Brazil) between 1986-2004: 89% poached and 11% entangled (Castelblanco-Martínez<em> et al</em>. 2007).</p><p> </p>  <p>The Natütama Foundation, which has a year-round Manatee monitoring program in place since 2002, registered three Manatees hunted in Colombia from 2003 to 2013 (Kendall 2013) and more than six in Peru from 2010-2015. Manatees are still being hunted in the river Putumayo upstream from Tarapaca and above the mouth of the Igaraparana, according to interviews with local Colombian fishermen, who say most of the hunters are Peruvian (S. Kendall pers. obs.). </p>  <p>In the Pacaya Samiria Reserve (Peru), Soto (2007) estimated an average of 35 Manatees killed in the basins of the Punahua, Ucayali and Marañon rivers.</p>  <p><strong>Incidental mortality, orphaned calves, and illegal captivity</strong></p>  <p>In addition to specific gillnets to hunt Manatees, the high use of fishing nets in the Amazon has increased incidental calf mortality in the past few years. These events have been documented in all Amazonian Manatee range countries (Reeves<em> et al. </em>1996, Orozco 2001, Franzini 2008, Souza 2015), and this is now a major threat for the species (Marmontel <em>et al.</em> 2012).</p>  <p>When calves survive drowning in nets, they may be kept alive for later sale<span lang=""EN-US""> as pets, kept in pools or areas close to water bodies, and sold or given to influential persons. The number of rescued calves every year has been increasing, but the number recorded represents a small sample of occurrences in the Amazon.</p>  <p>Between 2008 and 2010, in the Brazilian state of Pará, 28 stranded Manatees were rescued, of which only one was an adult (Sousa <em>et al. </em>2010). An important threat in Pará is the use of fishing corrals, as they are usually built over submerged aquatic vegetation beds, where Manatees feed, and have already trapped a Manatee (M. Sousa, pers. com. 2016).</p>  <p>Presently, several institutions in Brazil (Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazônia, Centro de Pesquisa e Preservação de Mamíferos Aquáticos, Mamirauá Institute and Zoofit) care for over 150 Manatees in captivity, mostly orphans. Between 2005 and 2015, INPA received an average of 10 calves per year. Of the 98 animals rescued during this period, 30% were accidentally caught in fishing nets (D. Souza pers. obs). In the past 10 years CPPMA received 39 calves for rehabilitation (S.M. Lazzarini pers. comm. 2016).</p>  <p>From 2010-2015, 3 calves died in nets or captivity in Peru (S. Kendall pers obs). It is estimated that two Amazonian Manatees are presently in captivity in Colombia (Castelblanco-Martínez&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2015).</p>  <p>Between 2007 and 2010, Centro de Rescate Amazónico (Iquitos, Peru) rescued 28 Manatees (Perea <em>et al. </em>2011), and until 2013 successfully rehabilitated 25 individuals (Landeo-Yauri <em>et al. </em>2013). Since 2011 &#160;the Centro released and monitored 11 of those rehabilitated animals (Landeo and&#160;Castelblanco-Martínez&#160;2015, Velásquez Varela <em>et al. </em>2015).</p>  <p><strong>Habitat alteration and disturbance</strong></p>  <p>Other anthropogenic actions have resulted in pollution, loss, alteration, degradation and fragmentation of habitats used by the Amazonian Manatee (Rosas and da Silva pers. comm. 2005, Kendall <em>et al. </em>2014). </p>  <p>Changes in the aquatic environment as habitat degradation due to deforestation, pollution, contamination of the rivers by mercury for the gold exploration (Amorim <em>et al.</em> 2000), pesticides and heavy metals from agricultural waste and oil spills are potential hazards to the Manatee´s food supply (Rosas <em>et al. </em>1991). These elements are absorbed by aquatic weeds and may directly affect the staple diet of the species (Rosas 1994). Roots of floating and rooted aquatic plants (<em>Paspalum, Eicchornia, Salvinia</em>) have been shown to be important methylation sites (Guimarães <em>et al. </em>2000).&#160;Over 300 dams are planned for the Amazon (Winemiller <em>et al. </em>2016), two of which are mega-enterprises in Brazil (Madeira and Xingu rivers). The building of dams can interfere with habitat quality, altering water speed, nutrient load and dynamics of macrophyte production (Junk and Nunes de Mello 1987). Brazil has extensive plans for navigation (Fearnside 2001, Brazil, PR, 2011) with dams allowing the opening of the waterway in the Tapajos river (Fearnside 2015) planned for soy transport, giving access to the Amazon river and the Atlantic ocean (Brazil, PR 2011, Millikan 2011).&#160;Amazonian Manatees are very sensitive to noise, and intense boat traffic on the Amazonian rivers can affect their behaviour and habitat use.</p>  <p>Oil spills may be a particular problem in Ecuador (Brice <em>et al. </em>2011, Utreras <em>et al. </em>2013, Brice 2014), where oil exploitation has been permitted in important refuges for the species (Utreras <em>et al. </em>2013). The use of fertilizers and weed control products in extensive monocultures (Utreras <em>et al. </em>2013), incidental captures in fishing nets, the use of dynamite, the increasing use of motorized boats including in the Cuyabeno and Jatuncocha systems where there are nature tourism activities (Utreras <em>et al. </em>2011a, b) are additional threats in Ecuador.</p>  <p>On the Peru-Colombia border, wood extraction activities are clogging lakes and stopping normal migrations of Manatees in the Atacuari area (S. Kendall pers obs).</p>  <p>Amazonian human populations are generally at low densities except in the large capital cities, but all of the issues above could be magnified by the increase in human population.</p><p>Tourism and transport are interfering more and more with low water resting places in the area around Puerto Nariño (Kendall <em>et al</em>. 2014).</p><p>Around the city of Belém and estuary of the Amazon River, boat traffic is intense and even ferries and cargo ships may interfere with Manatee movement (Miranda Leão <em>et al. </em>2014).</p>  <p><strong>Natural disasters, drought, climate change</strong></p><p>Extreme droughts may help make the Manatee an easier prey item for hunters, by causing isolation and entrapment. During the 2010 drought in the Piagaçu-Purus SDR (Purus River, Brazil), 180 Manatees were estimated killed (Souza <em>et al. </em>2014), but only a few cases of Manatees trapped by drought in the eastern Peruvian frontier area were recorded, and none in Colombia (S. Kendall pers obs).</p>  <p></p>","<p>Most of the waters inhabited by Amazonian Manatees are very murky and, probably as an adaptation to the past and ongoing hunting pressure, Amazonian Manatees are extremely secretive.&#160;T<span class=""alt-edited"">remendous<span class=""shorttext""> research efforts have been made,<span lang=""EN""> but&#160;there are no reliable population estimates available, although numbers are almost certainly lower than historical figures due to centuries of hunting. Analysis of feeding patches, direct sightings of <em>T. inunguis</em> and interview surveys have been used to try to estimate population numbers with limited results, due to opportunistic sightings and small samples without standardized effort. Traditional mark-recapture studies are not appropriate due to the species’ secretive nature. More recently there have been efforts to estimate populations with the use of rotary or side-scan sonars, but still with inconclusive results (Brice 2014, Francisco <em>et al.</em> 2015), which hinders the development of conservation strategies for the species. Magor empirically estimated a minimum population of 10,000 Amazonian Manatees for the Amazon basin (Husar 1977). Based on the analysis of mtDNA control region, Cantanhede <em>et al. </em>(2005) suggested a genetic estimate of the effective female population size of <em>T. inunguis</em> of approximately 455,000 individuals, indicative of a recent large population size. Genetic studies do not show a population structure throughout the region (Cantanhede <em>et al. </em>2005).</span></p><p>In Colombia, due to conservation efforts with local communities, a reduction in hunting levels and an apparent increase in&#160;Amazonian&#160;Manatee population in specific sites has been noted in the last few years. In the Colombian Amazon, the population may have stabilized, but hunting continues on the Peruvian side of the river and this affects the Colombian population. During 2010-2015, Natütama registered 3 to 4 new calves every year in Colombia. Fishermen insist that there are more Manatees now, mainly because they see groups of 7 to 10 Manatees more often (Kendall <em>et al. </em>2014). Systematic monitoring with former Manatee hunters recorded 364 sightings around Puerto Nariño in 2014, including five different calves (<span lang=""EN-US"">Castelblanco-Martínez&#160;</span><em>et a</em><em>l. </em>2015).</p><p>A study conducted 1996-1999 in Cuyabeno Reserve (Ecuador) contradicted Timm <em>et al.</em>'s<em>&#160;</em>(1986) prediction of extinction in 10 years. However, relative abundance in Cuyabeno River was 0.01 animal / h effort and 0.007 animal / h effort in Lagartococha River. A total 40-49 animals were sighted in the Cuyabeno Reserve between 1996 and 1998, where they are considered rare (Denkinger 2010). The use of sonar produced estimates ranging from 0.8 to 3.0 individuals / 10 km in three sites (Parque Nacional Yasuni, Lagartococha and Cocaya lake systems); no animals were detected in 58 km of the Cuyabeno lagoon system (Utreras <em>et al.</em> 2013). Brice (2014), using side-scan sonar observed 24 individuals in 70 hours of sampling in the same region. In Ecuador the species is considered Critically Endangered (CR) according to IUCN criteria C2a(i), which indicates an estimated population of less than 250 mature individuals, and no subpopulation with 50 mature individuals (IUCN 2001).</p><p>Guzmán (2014), also using a side scan sonar, recorded 14 Manatees in 65 km of rivers and lagoons, or 2.15 ind / 10 km in the Lagartococha river, on border Peru-Ecuador, an area partially surveyed by Utreras <em>et al. </em>(2013). Bodmer <em>et al. </em>(2006) believed the population in the Pacaya Samiria Reserve was stable due to a slight increase in counts between 2003 and 2006. However, Soto (2007) points out that the estimation method has not yet been proven.</p><p>In some sustainable development reserves (SDR) in Brazilian Amazon, hunting has been decreasing over the recent years. This is probably a reflection of the conservation actions that have occurred in the region, and the lack of interest among young fishermen for hunting the Manatee. The frequent records of sightings of adults and females with calves during the rainy and dry seasons in the Piagaçu-Purus SDR (Souza 2015) suggest that populations of <em>T. inunguis</em> may be stable or increasing in these regions.</p><p>Sixty two per cent&#160;of hunters interviewed by Calvimontes (2009) in Amanã SDR (Brazil) believed the population is decreasing, although they attribute this to Manatees having moved away (due to habitat alterations and increasing levels of noise) rather than hunting. Calvimontes also reported that most hunters are turning into farmers, which should decrease the pressure on the species.&#160;Seventy three&#160;per cent of interviewees in the Belém region (mouth of the Amazon) considered the Manatee population is decreasing, due to hunting, pollution, boat traffic and noise (Miranda 2014). Half of the respondents in Franzini <em>et al.</em>'s&#160;(2013) study believed Manatee numbers are declining.</p><p>Seventy&#160;per cent&#160;of interviewees in the Ucayali region of Peru believed the population is decreasing (Silva <em>et al. </em>2014). In a preliminary survey of Manatees in the Lagartococha region, in 6.9 km of canoe transects Hidalgo (2010) observed 16 Manatees and 25 feeding patches, which lead him to evaluate that Manatees in the Lagartococha river basin may be stable due to the almost null human presence.</p><p>The progressive increase in the number of young calves arriving at rehabilitation centres in Brazil in the past five years has also led several researchers to suspect that the species may be undergoing some recovery, or that the increase is simply a reflection of the awareness campaigns implemented, with a concomitant increase in the number of rescued calves (Rosas and da Silva pers. comm. 2005). Alternatively, it may also suggest that calf takes are on the rise.</p><p>Although Manatees are widespread through a large area, there is a high level of uncertainty about population size, as no reliable method for determining abundance has been defined so far. Whatever the current population size, the overall population trend is most likely to be decreasing, given the species’ slow reproduction (sirenian populations grow at an annual rate of approximately 5-6%; Marsh<em> et al. </em>2004, 2011) and levels of exploitation (Marmontel <em>et al.</em> 1992). In summary, although the population may be stabilizing in some parts of the Amazon region due to local awareness building and other conservation efforts, the overall trend is of a decreasing population.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>Amazonian Manatees occur in northern South America, and are endemic to the Amazon Basin. Amazonian Manatees occur through most of the Amazon River drainage, in river and lake systems, from the headwaters, in Colombia (Domning 1981), Ecuador (Timm <em>et al. </em>1986) and Peru (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1996) to the mouth of the Amazon (close to the Marajó Island) in Brazil (Best and Teixeira 1982, Miranda 2014) over an estimated seven million square kilometres. However, they are patchily distributed, concentrating in areas of nutrient-rich flooded forest, which covers around 300,000 km² (Junk 1997), but are limited by troubled waters (rapids and falls) and aquatic vegetation (Best 1983).</p>  <p>In Ecuador most records are from the extreme northeast, below 250 m altitude. From north to south there are records for the Güeppi river (tributary of Putumayo, in the border with Colombia), the Aguarico river and its Cuyabeno and Lagartococha systems, where most of the records come from (Denkinger 2010, Utreras <em>et al. </em>2011a, Utreras <em>et al.</em> 2013) and in tributaries such as the Yanayacu, Cocaya and Zancudococha lagoon; in the Napo region they are found in the Añangu, Challuacocha and Yuturi lagoon systems, as well as in the Tiputini river and Yasuní basin, including the Jatuncocha and Tambococha lagoon systems (Utreras <em>et al. </em>2011a). In Peru they occur in the Loreto region in the Samiria, Pacaya, Marañón, Pastaza, Ucayali, Huallaga, Purus, Tapiche, Yarapa and Yanayacu rivers, as well as in the lower Puinahua and Iricahua rivers in the Ucayali basin; their occurrence has been mentioned for the Nanay, Orosa, Yavarí, Yaguas and Putumayo rivers, and in the Reserva&#160; Comunal Tamshiyacu-Tahuayo, and in the Yanayacu-Pucate river (Silva 2010); in Colombia in the Putumayo, Amazon and lower Caquetá rivers; in Brazil they occur in most major river basins such as Solimões, Japurá, Juruá, Purus, Negro and Tapajós.</p>  <p>Although there are no records in the Guyana, the species may occasionally penetrate into southern Guiana close to the boundary with Brazil (Bertram and Bertram 1963). This possibility is enhanced by a Manatee rescue done by INPA in Takutu River border Brazil and Guyana (D. Souza pers. obs).</p>","<p>The historical main use of <em>T. inunguis</em> was to obtain oil, skin and meat (Domning 1982). In remote areas of the Brazilian Amazon, it is estimated that approximately 140,000 Manatees were killed between 1935 and 1954, not counting subsistence hunting (Best 1983, Rosas and Pimentel 2001), which still persists in modern times.</p><p>  </p><p>Currently, the main use of the species is for food. Manatee meat is highly valued, but all the other products are used as well (fat and skin are used in cooking and as medicine, bones are turned into utilitarian pieces and charms, and the skin produces very resistant leather). Medicinal uses are attributed to the fat being rubbed on the affected area (rheumatism and paralysis) and skin (helping the healing process of wounds and infections) (Miranda 2014). A Manatee is held for show to tourists in Puerto Alegria, Peru, upstream from Leticia (S. Kendall pers obs).</p>",Freshwater (=Inland waters),"<p>Manatees are protected by national laws in all countries of confirmed distribution (Brazil since 1967, Colombia since 1969, Peru since 1973 (Silva 2009) and Ecuador since 2002 (Tirira 2011)). Listed under Appendix I of CITES, signed by the four countries, also signatories of the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands. All but Colombia are parties to the Convention on Migratory Species.</p><p>Presently there are national management plans specific for the species in Colombia (Dirección de Ecosistemas 2005) and Brazil (Andrade <em>et al.</em> 2011) and for aquatic mammals (including Manatees) in Ecuador (Utreras <em>et al.</em> 2013). Management plans exist for two protected areas (Pacaya Samiria in Peru and Mamiraua Reserve in Brazil), and Puerto Nariño (Colombia) has informal local management agreement (S. Kendall pers. obs).</p><p>In 2014 the Biodiversity department of the Ministry of Environment of Ecuador included Manatee as a focal species for conservation, and relative abundance studies are planned for the Cuyabeno-Yasuni corridor in the Napo river basin between 2016 and 2018.

The species may also meet the threshold for Critically Endangered under D, as there may be less than 50 mature individuals in the wild.</p>","The primary habitat is arid and semi-arid bushland and grassland. In Eritrea and Ethiopia, the African Wild Ass lives in volcanic landscape of the Great Rift Valley where they range from below sea level in the Dalool Depression to 2,000 m (Moehlman <em>et al.</em> 2013). In Eritrea and Ethiopia, limited observations indicate that African Wild Asses are primarily grazers, but that they will also utilize browse. Typical of arid habitat equids, the only stable groups are composed of a female and her offspring. Females do associate with other females or with males, but even temporary groups are small. Low density and low sociability may be due to low forage quality and availability. In the Mille-Serdo Wild Ass Reserve the preferred forage is <em>Aristida</em> sp., <em>Chrysopogon plumulosus</em>, <em>Dactyloctenium schindicum</em>, <em>Digitaria</em> sp., <em>Lasiurus scindicus</em>, and <em>Sporobolus iocladus</em> (Kebede 1999, Moehlman 2002, Moehlman <em>et al</em>. 2013).  In Eritrea, <em>Pannicum turgidium</em> is an important forage species (Teclai 2006).","<p>The major threat to the African Wild Ass is hunting for food and medicinal purposes; for example, body parts and soup made from bones are used for treating tuberculosis, constipation, rheumatism, backache, and bone ache (Kebede 1999, Moehlman 2002, Moehlman <em>et al. </em>2013). Limited access to drinking water and forage (largely due to competition with livestock) is also a major constraint, with reproductive females and foals less than three-months old most at risk. Hence, it will continue to be important to determine critical water supplies and basic forage requirements, allowing management authorities to determine (in consultation with local pastoralists) how to conserve the African Wild Ass (Kebede 1999, 2007; Moehlman 2002; Teclai 2006; Moehlman <em>et al.</em> 2013). The third possible threat to the survival of the African Wild Ass is potential interbreeding with the domestic donkey (Moehlman 2002, Moehlman <em>et al. </em>2013). However, there is no scientific evidence that indicates hybridization of <em>Equus africanus somaliensis </em>with domestic donkeys (Kebede 2013). &#160;</p>","In Ethiopia, there has been a severe population decline since the early 1970s. Klingel (1977) recorded group sizes of 10-30 individuals in the Danakil, and he estimated a density of 18.6 wild asses per 100 km<sup>2</sup> in an area of approximately 10,000 km<sup>2</sup>. During that survey, Yangudi-Rassa National Park (NP) had the highest density (30 wild asses per 100 km<sup>2</sup>). In 1994, Moehlman and Kebede did a ground survey of the Yangudi-Rassa NP, but no wild asses were seen, although local Issa pastoralists reported that they were present but rare and occurred at an approximate density well below one animal per 100 km2 (Moehlman 1994, Kebede 1995, Moehlman <em>et al</em>. 1998). Surveys conducted from 1994-1998 in an area of 2,000 km2 indicated that there were approximately 0.5 wild ass per 100 km<sup>2</sup> (Moehlman 2002). In 2007, Kebede surveyed the historic range of the African Wild Ass in Ethiopia (Kebede <em>et al</em>. 2007) and determined that they have been extirpated from the Yangudi-Rassa NP and the Somali Region and that the only remaining population is in the northeastern Afar Region. The total number of wild ass observed during this survey was 25 in an area of 4,000 km<sup>2</sup> yielding a density of 0.625 animals per 100 km<sup>2</sup>. In 2009 and 2010, Kebede (2013) did quarterly ground surveys in the African Wild Ass range and sampled 17% of the total African Wild Ass range in Ethiopia (12,300 km<sup>2</sup>). The density estimate was computed applying D=N/A where D=density, N total number of individuals recorded, A= sample area (km<sup>2</sup>). Then the result obtained was extrapolated to the suitable habitat determined using the Maxent model to estimate the population (Kebede <em>et al</em>. 2014). The 2009-2010 survey results indicated that the species’ distribution is restricted to few localities in the Danakil. The current population estimate indicated that this species occurs in low density, approximately one African Wild Ass per 100 km<sup>2</sup>. Current population estimates indicate that the population size has declined significantly (~94%) since the 1970’s and 112±4 individuals of African Wild Asses are estimated to survive in the Danakil desert (Kebede 2013).<br/><br/>In Eritrea, there are limited long-term data. The first successful survey was made in 1996 (Moehlman <em>et al</em>. 1998) and there has been a research and conservation programme with the Ministry of Agriculture and Hamelmalo Agricultural College. The main study site in the Northern Red Sea Zone has had a population of roughly 47 individuals per 100 km<sup>2</sup> (Moehlman <em>et al</em>. 1998, Moehlman 2002). This is the highest population density found anywhere in the present range of the species and is similar to population densities recorded in Ethiopia in the early 1970s (Klingel 1977). This is a limited study area (100 km<sup>2</sup>), but recent research indicates that African Wild Ass currently inhabit approximately 11,000 km<sup>2</sup> in the Denkelia desert (Teclai 2006). Surveys and Maxent analyses of suitable habitat are needed to determine the distribution and density of African Wild Ass in this larger area. A rough estimate of African Wild Ass in Eritrea would yield a total of possibly 400 individuals.<br/><br/>In 1978-1980, Watson (1982) did aerial surveys in northern Somalia and estimated that there was a population of 4,000-6,000 African wild ass in the area from the Nugaal Valley to the Djibouti border. Given the area covered by the survey, this would indicate approximately six African wild ass per 100 sq km.&#160; In 1979/82 Simonetta and Simonetta (1983) estimated that there were about 250 African Wild Ass in the northwestern Nugaal Valley and that there were about 50 African Wild Ass near Meit, with scattered groups along the coast in the Erigavo region. In 1989 (Moehlman 1998) a ground survey with limited aerial reconnaissance in the Nugaal Valley yielded population estimates of roughly 135 to 205 wild asses or approximately 2.7 to 4.1 asses per 100 km2. This indicates that there perhaps has been a significant reduction in the African wild ass population during the decade between those surveys. In 1997, Moehlman returned to the Nugaal Valley but was not able to survey the entire area. Local pastoralists said that there was less than ten African wild ass left in the Nugaal Valley (Moehlman et al. 2013). Some animals may remain near Meit and Erigavo, but this area has not been surveyed since the 1970s (Moehlman <em>et al</em>. 2013). It is not known if African Wild Ass currently persists in Somalia.<br/><br/>In summary, the total number of observed African Wild Ass in Eritrea and Ethiopia is roughly 70 individuals; there may be as many as 600 individuals in these two countries, but this figure is a very rough extrapolation from more intensely studied areas. The number of mature individuals is approximately one-third of the population (Feh <em>et al</em>. 2001), hence the minimum number of mature individuals is 23 and the maximum might be 200. In Ethiopia, in the last 35 years there has been a greater that 95% population decline and in the last 12 years the African Wild Ass has been extirpated from roughly 50% of its range (Kebede <em>et al</em>. 2007). In Eritrea, the population is stable and slowly increasing. However, it is difficult to predict population trends into the future. The desert habitat of the African Wild Ass in both Eritrea and Ethiopia suffers from recurrent and extreme droughts (Kebede 1999).",Decreasing,"The African Wild Ass occurs in Eritrea and Ethiopia, and some animals may persist in Djibouti, Somalia, Sudan and Egypt, but there is no recent information available (Moehlman <em>et al</em>. 2013). Yalden <em>et al</em>. (1996) recorded them to 1,500 m in Ethiopia.<br/><br/>Two subspecies are recognized. The Nubian Wild Ass, <em>E. a. africanus</em>, lived in the Nubian desert of north-eastern Sudan, from east of the Nile River to the shores of the Red Sea, and south to the Atbara River and into northern Eritrea (Watson 1982). During aerial flights in the 1970s, wild asses were seen in the Barka Valley of Eritrea and in the border area between Eritrea and the Sudan (Watson 1982). The Somali Wild Ass, <em>E. a. somaliensis</em>, was found in the Denkelia region of Eritrea, the Danakil Desert and the Awash River Valley in the Afar region of north-eastern Ethiopia, western Djibouti, and into the Ogaden region of eastern Ethiopia. In Somalia, they ranged from Meit and Erigavo in the north to the Nugaal Valley, and as far south as the Shebele River (Moehlman 2002, Moehlman <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>The current range of the African Wild Ass in Ethiopia and Eritrea is approximately 23,000 km<sup>2</sup> (Kebede 2013, Teclai 2006). DNA extracted from faecal samples collected from animals in Eritrea and Ethiopia resulted in the identification of five mitochondrial DNA haplotypes: one haplotype (group of polymorphisms) is specific to the Eritrean population (haplotype D); one haplotype specific to the Ethiopian population (haplotype E); and three shared haplotypes (A, B, and C). These results suggest that there is and/or has been gene flow between the subpopulations (Afrera, Serdo) in Ethiopia and the population in Eritrea (Oakenfull <em>et al</em>. 2002).",The African Wild Ass is hunted for food and medicinal products. It is only hunted at the subsistence level.,Terrestrial,"In Ethiopia, the Yangudi-Rassa National Park (4,731 km<sup>2)</sup> and the Mille-Serdo Wild Ass Reserve (8,766 km<sup>2</sup>) were established in 1969. However, the former has never been formally gazetted, and both areas are utilized by large numbers of pastoralists and their livestock. These areas are remote and extremely arid, and the Ethiopian Wildlife Conservation Authority (EWCA) has not had sufficient funds or personnel for appropriate management (Kebede 1999). In Eritrea, the government designated the African wild ass area between the Buri Peninsula and the Dalool Depression as a high-priority area for conservation protection as a nature reserve. In both Eritrea and Ethiopia, research and conservation programs (Ministry of Agriculture and EWCA) have been critical for sustaining African Wild Ass populations by involving local pastoralists in their conservation. There are no protected areas in the range of the species in Somalia.<br/><br/>The African Wild Ass is listed as CITES Appendix I in both Ethiopia and Eritrea. Populations of Somali Wild Ass are maintained in captivity (Moehlman 2002, Kebede 2013). <br/><br/>Recommended research and conservation actions, include:<br/><ul><li>Ecosystems based and population dynamics research on the African Wild Ass in Eritrea and Ethiopia</li><li>Research on interactions among pastoralists, livestock, wildlife and the environment</li><li>Awareness campaign with local communities in Ethiopia on medicine/veterinary care</li><li>Continued employment and training of local pastoralists as scouts</li><li>Continued education and awareness campaigns on the ecological and cultural roles of wildlife</li><li>Continued workshops and active involvement of local pastoralists in the preparation of management plans</li><li>Post-graduate training of personnel in Eritrea and Ethiopia</li><li>Surveys in Eritrea, Djibouti, Sudan and Egypt to determine current distribution of African Wild Ass</li><li>Genetic research on the African Wild Ass and local domestic donkey populations to clarify the genetic status of the two subspecies.</li></ul><p></p>",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

Population declines are estimated to be greater than 50% in the past 3 generations (33 years). Furthermore the causes of population decline have not ceased and are inferred to be greater than 50% decline in the next 3 generations (33 years). This is inferred from current trends of continued habitat loss, hunting estimates as well impacts of climate change, which will shift the suitable climatic conditions up the mountain. In addition there are estimated to be less than 2,500 mature individuals remaining, with an estimated continuing decline of at least 20% in the next 2 generations (22 years). There has been and remains significant hunting pressure in Ecuador, however in Colombia and Peru the hunting pressure on this species still continues. It is extremely rare to encounter an area with Mountain Tapirs where they are not being over-hunted. Overall the mountain tapir population is fragmented as a result of human activities.&#160;There has also been widespread cattle introduction into the last remaining mountain tapir refuges. For example, cattle have been observed to be forming reproducing families in western Sangay National Park. Illegal mining is an important threat that is increasing population fragmentation, increasing contamination of watersheds and increasing illegal hunting. Mining projects in northern Peru and central Andes of Colombia threatens to destroy the headwater cloud forests and paramos of the scant population of mountain tapirs there.</p>","<p>The four major habitat types for <em>Tapirus pinchaque </em>are: Paramo, Jalca and Tropical montane forest. Elevations range from 1,400 m to the snowline (Downer 1997).</p>","<p>Formerly hunting pressure was the primary threat through most areas of the Mountain Tapir’s distribution (C. Downer pers. comm.) but today, poppy growing and its eradication, warfare and habitat fragmentation are currently the main threats on this species (E. Constantino pers. comm.). In some areas, hunting is decreasing due to local regulations and people’s increased awareness of this species’ rarity and conservation status. While a few Mountain Tapir populations may benefit because guerrilla presence which may relieve colonization pressure in Colombia by promoting the abandonment of conflict areas (C. Downer pers. comm.), most local biologists feel the presence of the guerrilla is having an overall negative impact on the species’ conservation. Additionally, the “actors” of the armed conflicts in Colombia (army, guerrilla, and paramilitaries) see the presence of field biologists and researchers in the areas that they control as a threat for their safety (Dávalos 2001, Semple 2000). The slow reproduction rate, large home range, and generally solitary nature of Mountain Tapirs make them particularly vulnerable to destruction of habitat and fragmentation by encroaching agriculture (Downer 1997). Habitat fragmentation is caused by conversion of forests and páramos to cattle ranching and agricultural lands. Another major threat to mountain tapirs in Colombia and Peru is the development of new mining projects and illegal mining contaminating water sources.<br/>The major threat to mountain tapirs in Colombia is human population growth in the Andean region.  People settling in the region need land, consumables and services, and their activities lead to habitat destruction.&#160; <br/></p><p>Additional threats include the development of hydroelectric dams, highways crossing protected areas, petroleum exploration, and electrical networks etc. There are numerous reports of tapir being hit by cars so infrastructure development through habitat is a potential major threat. There are numerous proposed highway and other projects in the Andes which would greatly increase vehicular mortalities. Once the construction of these highways is finalized, the vehicles will be able to drive at high speed and the animals crossing the roads will become even more vulnerable. Additionally, these roads will provide easier access to poachers, given the fact that the park lacks enough park rangers to patrol and protect the area. <br/>Tapir skin was used in the past for manufacture working tools (backpacks, ropes to ride horses, baskets etc.) and other things such as carpets and covers for beds. Traditional medicine makes use of tapir parts for medicinal purposes being commercialized in local markets.&#160; Also tapir parts are prescribed for medicinal purposes&#160; by shamans. <br/></p><p>Widespread cattle introduction into the last remaining Mountain Tapir refuges is a serious problem which will likely escalate in the near future. Cattle is a serious risk of transmission of infectious diseases and other etiological agents that they may carry. Disease transmission from cattle has been documented for Mountain, Baird’s and lowland tapirs in other locations. Another problem in Colombia are the fumigations being conducted in National Parks and all zones where cultivation of drugs can be found, including Andean forests in the Central and Oriental Cordilleras. These fumigations are authorized and promoted by the Colombian government, and are a major threat for the mountain tapir populations. The habitat is seriously affected and the animals can possibly be poisoned when in contact with the poison used for the fumigations (Round-Up), which is selective but can affect the availability of food resources.<br/>In Peru, there is a lack of protected areas big enough to maintain viable populations. Also the enforcement of environmental policies is weak.<br/>Global warming has the potential to decrease the suitable habitat available for mountain tapirs in the near future. If the temperature increases, the climatic conditions suitable for mountain tapir to occur will be shifting to higher altitudes, decreasing the capacity of the current protected areas to conserve mountain tapir habitat.&#160;&#160; </p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>","<p>The Mountain Tapir population is fragmented as a result of human activities and the total population is estimated to be less than 2,500 mature individuals with an estimated continuing decline of at least 20% in the next 2 generation (22 years).</p><p><br/></p>",Decreasing,"<p>Mountain Tapir (<em>Tapirus pinchaque)</em> is known from the Andean area of Columbia, Ecuador, and northernmost Peru were new records have been acquired from the&#160; southern Huancabanba depresure.

In Colombia, there are no tapirs in the Western Cordillera, northern part of the Central- and Eastern-Cordilleras, Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, Serrania de la Macarena and Cerro Tacarcuna. Historically the species has also been recorded in Venezuela, however, currently there is no evidence of its occurrence in this country. The southern limit now includes regions of Cajamarca and Lambayeque, specifically in Cañaris in Ferrañafe province and Querocoto in Chota province.&#160; The most threatened populations are those of the Central Cordillera between National Park Las Hermosas and National Park Nevado del Huila where large tracks of mature montane forests are being converted to opium fields. <em>T. pinchaque</em> is now extinct in much of its former range.</p>","This species is hunted for food, use of hides and medicinal uses.",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"<p>Included on CITES Appendix I.

45174127,21474,Tapirus terrestris,Vulnerable,A2cde+3cde,2019,2018-07-31 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is considered to be Vulnerable due to ongoing population reduction estimated to be slightly greater than 30% in the past three generations (33 years) due to habitat loss, illegal hunting, road-kill and competition with livestock, and the current rate of decline is projected to continue for the next three generations (33 years). Although this rate of decline seems improbable considering the species’ occurrence in the vast Amazon, the fact is that the species has been extirpated over large portions of its range and severely reduced in other large portions. Lowland tapir populations seem unlikely to persist anywhere humans occur at densities any greater than 1/km².<br/><br/>The estimated 30% decline over three generations takes into consideration the entire global range and was calculated using an average of reduction between a variety of biomes. Although only about 15-20% of the Amazon has been deforested in the past 30 years, 90% of the Atlantic forests have disappeared and 40% of the Pantanal has been converted to human use. Most of the Cerrado and Caatinga biomes have been converted to agriculture and cattle ranching, however this has happened over a period greater than three generations. Even where habitat remains, populations are reduced and dispersed due to the effects of hunting,&#160; which is greatly amplified around increasing human populations and settlement of the Amazon basin, especially along rivers and in the Andean foothills.<br/><br/>The effects of deforestation, hunting, and competition from domestic livestock have all contributed to population declines and fragmentation in the past and are inferred to continue at the present rate (if not more) into the future. An increase in road-kill is leading to tapir population declines in the Cerrado, the Pantanal, and the Atlantic Forest. Deforestation is increasing in certain parts of the species' range (e.g. Chaco Forest), while subsistence hunting and a developing wild-meat industry may cause further declines in the future. The Lowland Tapir&#160;is now either completely absent or severely fragmented across much of its historic range, with the Northern Amazon and the remaining Pantanal (Bolivia, Brazil, and Paraguay) becoming important strongholds as southern, eastern and northwestern populations are declining rapidly.","<em>Tapirus terrestris </em>inhabits lowland South American moist swamp forests, dry and moist shrublands and grasslands and a wide variety of wetlands. Habitat association varies extensively, although the most important habitats tend to be moist, wet or seasonally inundated areas (Bodmer and Brooks 1997, Ayala and Wallace 2009). This species has been observed to be associated with both water and salt-licks. The degree to which tapir are tolerant to habitat degradation varies regionally, but generally tapir are a forest dependent species. To date, no conclusion has been drawn as to why tapirs may thrive in one partially logged or disturbed area and be absent from others, however, it can be inferred based on other tapir species that Lowland Tapir&#160;cannot tolerate large scale habitat change in combination with hunting pressure. There is some evidence from the Atlantic Forest that suggests tapirs can tolerate radical large scale changes in habitat, as they have been found to persist in landscapes of commercially produced grains with only small degraded forest fragments (Rossi <em>et al.</em> 1999). Additional evidence from the interior of Sao Paulo and Parana confirms this research. Habitat condition appears to be less important in limiting population persistence than hunting and deaths caused by vehicle collisions.<br/>Harald Beck (pers. comm.) reports that tapirs have higher densities in Amazonian forests that contain two crucial features: Aguajales and salt licks.  Aguajales are palm swamps that typically range between 0.1 ha to over 100 ha and are dominated by the Mauritia flexuosa palm. The fruits of this palm are a crucial food resource for tapirs especially during the dry season.  In fact, tapirs are the prime seed dispersers for this palm, indicating the close evolutionary relationship between both species. Furthermore, Aguajales have incoming streams or small rivers which may also be crucial for other ecological requirements of tapir's including thermoregulation thus they sustain higher tapir densities.  Salt licks are smaller aquatic systems and may occur in clumped spatial distribution. Tapirs, among other mammals, frequently visit salt licks to obtain essential minerals.  Hunters, knowing the tapir’s fondness for salt, wait at those locations because their success is dramatically increased.<br/><br/>Tapir are ecologically more prone to be impacted by hunting due to long gestation and generational time. Reproduction is slow enough to make recovery difficult for the species in areas where there is any prolonged hunting activity. Hunting is a serious threat along the numerous new road systems, settlement and along the agricultural frontier in the Amazon basin. Hunting also occurs around logging camps and can completely eliminate the species from seemingly viable habitat.","<p>The main threats to the species include loss of habitat through deforestation, hunting for meat, road-kill, and competition with domestic livestock. The impacts of hunting on populations are amplified by the very low ability of tapir to quickly re-populate impacted areas. Though several strongholds occur - populations have been severely reduced and fragmented across the entire Cerrado (Brazil), Chaco (Argentina/ Paraguay), Atlantic forest (Brazil/ Argentina/ Paraguay) and llanos (Venezuela/Colombia) biomes. In Argentina and southern Brazil the species has been extirpated from the tropical and temperate grassland and shrubland - and are rapidly declining in the dry Chaco. Additionally the species has been extirpated from the entire Caatinga biome of north-eastern Brazil. <br/> <br/> In the northeast, tapirs are present only inside protected areas where illegal hunting is minimal. Outside protected areas, they are still hunted, chased by dogs, and negatively impacted by competition with cattle and illegal timber activities. The species is in rapid decline along the eastern Amazon and its Southern Tributaries where extensive hunting and deforestation have reduced almost all large mammal populations. In addition, populations are declining rapidly along the agricultural front spreading into western Brazil and along the Andean foothills of Ecuador and Colombia.<br/> <br/> In Argentina, <em>T. terrestris</em> has disappeared from around 50% of its original distribution, as a consequence of deforestation, hunting and livestock activity. The species is absent in many areas of transition between the montane forests, in important sectors of the Chaco and the Atlantic forest and completely in the Espinal. However, there are still populations in good condition in some forested areas, mainly those with limited accessibility and human activities, such as mountain forests or protected areas with strict controls. There is currently an important effort to reintroduce the species in the province of Corrientes (Esteros del Iberá).<br/> <br/> Roadkill is becoming a major threat to Tapir in the Cerrado (Brazil), the Pantanal (Brazil), and the Atlantic Forest (Argentina/Brazil) (P. Medici pers.comm, D. Varela in litt.).</p>  <p>In Bolivia, tapirs are susceptible to hunting, and habitat degradation. While they may well be more common than expected in protected areas, as was found out in Costa Rica and elsewhere for <em>T. bairdii</em>, they do not fare well in the presence of hunting. In French Guiana, tapirs are regularly hunted and sold commercially for meat in markets and restaurants. Little information is available for the population in Guyana, however, tapirs are not protected there at present and are hunted by subsistence hunters as well as by a developing bush-meat industry as roads are cut into the forest for logging.</p>  <p>In Paraguay a recent threatened species workshop assessed the Lowland Tapir as ""Vulnerable A2ac"" mainly due to habitat loss in the last 40 years, and the resulting decline in the distribution and population of the species.&#160; More than 90% of the Atlantic Forest has been lost, and the Chaco could experience the same declines over the next 30 years. Hunting and habitat loss were identified as main threats to the species.<br/> <br/> In conclusion it is difficult to calculate the overall impact of hunting on populations, but we can infer from previous studies that in the past 30 years extensive and ongoing habitat loss combined with hunting and accumulated indirect threats have been much greater than previously estimated, and much greater than would be suspected by looking at maps of remaining forest in the Amazon.</p>","Very little is known of Lowland Tapir populations. Populations are decreasing across its range, though numerous strongholds exist. However, there is insufficient information available to extrapolate population sizes across these regions. In recent years camera-traps have been effective for estimating probability of occupancy, relative abundance, and even density estimates for many species within the tapir's range (Trolle <em>et al.</em> 2008, Cruz 2012, Wallace <em>et al.</em> 2012, Tobler <em>et al.&#160;</em>2013, Ferregueti <em>et al.</em> 2017).&#160;A variety of density estimates have been proposed ranging from 0.20 to 3.7 individuals/km² (P. Medici pers. comm). The most likely reason for this variation is both sampling and study design bias as well as the fact that Lowland Tapir, although generally rare and elusive, can be locally common (i.e. around salt lick and permanent and seasonal water sources). In fact great variation in density likely also reflects the results of both direct and indirect threats in the form of hunting pressure, protection and seasonal variation.  Additionally, it can also reflect the tapir’s ability to adapt to different habitat types and availability of resources (food and water).",Decreasing,"<em>Tapirus terrestris</em> is found in lowland regions of northern and central South America, from Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela. Historically this species was found east of the Andes and north of the Espinal grasslands and shrublands of Argentina throughout the chaco, pantanal, cerrado, llanos, caatinga and Amazonian/Orinoco forests, however, populations have been severely reduced and often limited to forest biomes and wetlands. The species has been extirpated from the caatinga. In the northern Andes Lowland Tapir has been extirpated from the dry inter-Andean valleys and is becoming increasingly rare along the agriculture frontiers than are sweeping through parts of the western and southern Amazon basin. The distribution in the cerrado has been diminished to a few small populations in protected areas and those in the pantanal are rapidly declining.","This species is hunted for food. Also, the skin is used internationally, with leather goods products having been seen for sale in Italy (A. Shoemaker pers. comm).",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"This species occurs in numerous protected areas across its range. The species is officially and legally protected in many range countries, however, hunting laws are seldom enforced and therefore these have proven ineffective. It is listed on CITES Appendix II.<br/><br/>In Argentina, one of the main tapir populations in the Chaco forest was protected by the recently created Impenetrable National Park. In the Atlantic Forest of north-eastern Argentina, wildlife underpasses and overpasses were built for mitigating roadkill. Camera trap monitoring confirmed tapir use of these mitigation structures (D. Varela, in litt.). Currently, there are some experiences of tapir re-introduction in areas where the species was extinct many decades ago (e.g. the Iberá wetland in Argentina and the Rio de Janeiro Atlantic Forest in Brazil).",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

Much of its range is in China, which has regionally assessed the Tolai Hare as Least Concern (Wang and Xie 2004; Jiang <em>et al.</em> 2015, 2016). However, data on Tolai Hare populations are lacking, and the increased human population and concomitant habitat loss may be instrumental in causing a decline in the Tolai Hare; studies are needed to accurately determine the status of this species.","The Tolai Hare inhabits semi-desert, mountain-steppe, forest steppe, and rocky habitats (Tsevegmid and Tsendjav 2004, Sokolov <em>et al.</em> 1994). It also occurs in grasslands and forest meadows (Smith and Xie 2008). The Tolai Hare does not occupy true forests. It is a nocturnal species (Sokolov <em>et al.</em> 1994, Smith and Xie 2008). Diet consists of roots, grass, and other herbaceous plants (Smith and Xie 2008). Tolai Hares take shelter under shrubs, under rocks, or by digging shallow pits. When fleeing predators they run in a straight line, and are able to jump a length of 2.5–3m (Sokolov <em>et al.</em> 1994).","Hunting (for meat, skins, and for traditional medicines) has been identified as a threat to the Tolai Hare in Mongolia (Clark <em>et al.</em> 2006).","In Mongolia, populations are characterized as large, with no apparent decline (Clark <em>et al.</em> 2006). In Russia, the population density can reach 10–30 individuals per 100ha (Sokolov <em>et al.</em> 1994). One study looked at Mongolian commercial harvest data obtain from Dornad Aimag between 1932-1993, which did not indicate any apparent change in Tolai Hare takes (Reading <em>et al.</em> 1998). The authors specify that the data may or may not provide a valid indication of population trends (Reading <em>et al.</em> 1998). In southern Uzbekistan, pelt takes decreased from 8,751 in 1959 to 595 in 1977 (Volozheninov 1980).

This species was observed at an elevation of 2,400 m on Yihe-Bogdo, Mongolia (Ognev 1966). In China, it is usually located at elevations between 600-900m (Smith and Xie 2008), although it has been reported to occur as high as 4,900 m (Smith <em>et al.</em> 2018).

There is a continuing decline in populations outside protected areas (and even within some protected areas) due to persecution and habitat loss, although this is not sufficient to warrant listing in a threatened category.","Spotted Hyaenas are present in all habitats including semi-desert, savanna and open woodland, dense dry woodland, and even montane habitats, such as in the Aberdares, Mt Kenya, and the Ethiopian Highlands, up to 4,100 m altitude (Young and Evans 1993, East and Hofer 2013). It is absent from, or present at very low densities in, extreme desert conditions, the highest altitudes on mountains, and tropical rainforests, although they may make deep incursions into forested areas where logging roads provide access (Kingdon 1977, Henschel and Ray 2003). In many parts of their range, they occur in close association with human habitations. Although long periods may elapse between drinking, Spotted Hyaenas are at least somewhat dependent on water, and Tilson and Henschel (1986) recorded an instance where a clan dispersed after the only water source in their range dried up. Often considered just scavengers,&#160;Spotted Hyaenas&#160;are in fact effective and flexible hunters as well (Kruuk 1972, Höner <em>et al.</em> 2002); damage to domestic stock mainly involves cattle, sheep, and goats and varies widely in intensity (Hofer 1998). The ecology of the species is reviewed by Holekamp and Dloniak (2010) and East and Hofer (2013).","Outside protected areas, populations are subject to persecution by humans through culling (shooting and spearing), trapping and poisoning. Such activities may sometimes occur within the boundaries of conservation areas: mortality due to wire snares set to catch wild herbivores for meat is an important cause of adult mortality in the Serengeti, where snares kill around 400 adult Spotted Hyaenas each year and are responsible for more than half of all adult mortality (Hofer <em>et al.</em> 1996). Apparently only since the mid-1970s has game meat hunting rapidly expanded, as more people have moved within walking distance of the boundaries of protected areas such as in the north and west of the Serengeti (Hofer 1998). Entire clans of&#160;Spotted Hyaenas&#160;may be killed by poisoning (Holekamp <em>et al.</em> 1993), and many individuals are killed when hit by vehicles. Spotted Hyaena populations in protected areas may be decimated by authorities when they are considered a threat for other wildlife species such as lions, cheetahs and rhinos. Government officials and managers may also allow local human residents within protected areas to kill&#160;Spotted Hyaenas&#160;when they are suspected or known to have preyed upon livestock. The numbers killed by licensed sport hunters are probably small as they are not considered an attractive species. It is also killed for food, medicine and witchcraft (Hofer and Mills 1998b). A further threat is posed by the decline in densities of wildlife species consumed by&#160;Spotted Hyaenas&#160;due to habitat loss caused by increased human settlement, overgrazing by livestock, and game-meat hunting by humans.","Viable populations exist in a number of countries and a tentative estimate of the total global population is between 27,000 and 47,000. The largest known populations occur in the Serengeti ecosystem in Tanzania and Kenya (7,200-7,700 in the Tanzanian sector and 500-1,000 in the Kenyan sector) and the Kruger National Park in South Africa (1,300-3,900).<br/><br/>Population densities based on systematic censuses vary substantially, from 0.006 individuals per km² in Namibia to 2.4 individuals per km² in the Ngorongoro Crater in Tanzania (Hofer and Mills 1998b, Holekamp and Dloniak 2010, Höner <em>et al.</em> 2012). Low population densities occur in semi-desert areas in southern Africa (0.006-0.05 individuals per km²), such as the Namib (Tilson and Henschel 1986) and Etosha Pan (Gasaway <em>et al.</em> 1991). High densities occur in savanna and some open woodlands in Tanzania and Kenya, as well as in montane forests (0.32-2.4 individuals per km²), such as Selous Game Reserve (Creel and Creel 1996), Aberdare National Park (Sillero-Zubiri and Gotelli 1992) and Ngorongoro Crater (Höner <em>et al.</em> 2012). Most populations in protected areas in southern Africa and several populations in eastern Africa are considered to be stable.<br/><br/>There is evidence that a few populations have increased during the past years. In Eritrea, there were no confirmed records of the species until the 1990s, but since then, Spotted Hyaenas have been recorded throughout the country and the population is believed to be increasing (F. Hagos pers. comm. 2014). Similarly, in Chad, the population of the largest national park has experienced a two-fold increase during the last few years (Olléová and Dogringar 2013). In contrast, many populations in eastern, central and western Africa, are considered to be declining, even in protected areas, mostly due to an increase in human-wildlife conflict during which humans poison and cull&#160;Spotted Hyaenas, and due to incidental snaring (Hofer and Mills 1998b, Holekamp and Dloniak, pers. obs.). In Gabon, substantial efforts to find Spotted Hyenas revealed that single individuals from The Republic of Congo may enter Gabon from time to time, but there is no evidence of a resident population in Gabon (Bohm 2012, Henschel <em>et al.</em> 2014).",Decreasing,"Spotted Hyaenas are relatively widely distributed in Africa, south of the Sahara. Their current distribution is patchy, especially in West and Central Africa, with populations often concentrated in protected areas. More continuous distributions persist over large areas of Chad, Central African Republic, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Botswana, Angola, Namibia, and parts of South Africa. Künzel <em>et al.</em> (2000) reported that&#160;Spotted Hyaenas&#160;are still widespread in Djibouti, and Grubb <em>et al</em>. (1998) noted the same for Gambia. Long-term studies on&#160;Spotted Hyaenas&#160;and recent surveys have confirmed their presence in Benin, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Ethiopia, Ghana, Côte d'Ivoire, Kenya, Malawi, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, The Republic of Congo, Senegal, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe (Vermeulen 2007, Henschel <em>et al.</em> 2014, Höner <em>et al.</em> 2012, East and Hofer 2010, Holekamp and Dloniak 2010, T. Aebischer pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/> In Eritrea, Spotted Hyaenas have not or only very rarely been sighted until 2007, but they are now regularly sighted throughout the country (F. Hagos pers. comm. 2014). It is thus likely that&#160;Spotted Hyaenas&#160;established a small population in Eritrea. Spotted Hyaenas may occasionally enter Gabon from The Republic of Congo but there is no evidence to suggest that there is a resident population in Gabon (Bohm 2012, Henschel <em>et al.</em> 2014). Hofer and Mills (1998a) reported the species as extinct in Algeria where they may have occurred in the Ahaggar and Tassili d’Ajjer. There is also no confirmed evidence of their occurrence in Egypt, Lesotho, Liberia, Libya, Tunisia, or Morocco, and no recent records from Togo.","In at least two locations in Ethiopia, live, wild Spotted Hyaenas are utilized by locals for tourism. Tourists pay to feed Spotted Hyaenas by hand, and some believe that the hyaenas take away bad spirits and that feeding them will cure various ailments. Hair and scraps of skin are often collected from dead animals and are used as talismans. In several areas in Tanzania,&#160;Spotted Hyaenas&#160;and their body parts are utilized for witchcraft. In Nigeria, local people earn money by keeping Spotted Hyaenas and showing them to spectators on exhibition walks.",Terrestrial,"Legal classification varies from “vermin” (parts of Ethiopia) to fully protected in conservation areas.

It almost qualifies as threatened under criterion C1.","In most of its range the&#160;Striped Hyaena&#160;occurs in open habitat or light thorn bush country in arid to semi-arid environments (Hofer 1998, Alam <em>et al.</em> 2014, Wagner 2013). These animals avoid open desert (such as the centre of the Arabian desert and the Sahara, though they may occur at low density in the central Saharan massifs), dense thickets and forests. Nevertheless, it was reported from Lebanon and Jordan that they inhabit thick Mediterranean oak forests (Abi-Said 2006, Qarqaz <em>et al. </em>2004), and also avoid high altitudes; however, it has been recorded to 3,300 m in Pakistan (Roberts 1977), 2,700 m in the Moroccan High Atlas (Cuzin 2003), at least to 2,300 m in the Ethiopian Highlands (Yalden <em>et al.</em> 1996), and 2,200 m in the Lebanese mountains (Abi-Said and Marrouche Abi-Said 2007). Striped Hyaenas are sometimes found close to dense human settlements (e.g., Israel, Lebanon and Algeria). Individuals have been recorded 19 km south of Tel Aviv, 5 km east of the international airport and on the Tel Aviv-Haifa highway near Mount Carmel (Hofer 1998 and references therein), the highest density in Lebanon was recorded in an urban area 10 km north of Beirut (Abi-Said and Marrouche Abi-Said 2007),&#160;and in the suburbs of Algiers (K. de Smet pers. comm. 2007). Striped Hyaenas are unafraid of humans and frequently forage on garbage and carrion near to human habitation (Alam <em>et al.</em> 2014, Tourani <em>et al. </em>2012,&#160;Abi-Said 2006, K. de Smet, F. Cuzin and M. Masseti pers. comm. 2014). Young animals are even kept as pets in some areas.","The major reasons for the apparent decline include persecution (especially poisoning), decreasing natural and domestic sources of carrion due to declines in the populations of other large carnivores (Wolf, Cheetah, Leopard, Lion, Tiger) and their prey, and changes in livestock practices (Hofer 1998). Humans are consistently indicated as the major source of mortality throughout the evaluated range, largely because the hyaena is loathed as a grave robber,&#160;is associated with several superstitions&#160;(e.g. in the Middle East), and because of incidents of damage to agriculture (e.g. in Israel) and livestock (Abi-Said 2006, Bunaian <em>et al.</em> 2001, Hofer 1998, Al Younis 1993, Wagner 2013). Striped Hyaenas are very susceptible to accidental or targeted poisoning as they readily accept strychnine-poisoned bait. For example, along the Mediterranean coast in Israel, the&#160;Striped Hyaena&#160;was exterminated by strychnine poisoning during the rabies eradication campaign administered by the British government between 1918 and 1948. The&#160;Striped Hyaenas ate poisoned donkey carcasses that were provided to control Golden Jackals, then the main carrier of rabies. Further large-scale poisoning occurred between 1950 and 1970 (Hofer 1998). In Jordan, Lebanon, and the Palmyra area in Syria, the species is heavily persecuted (including destruction or blockage of dens, poisoning carcasses, or the use of the fire to chase animals out of dens) (Abi-Said 2006, Qarqaz <em>et al. </em>2004). There is also illegal trade in skins, and body parts for use in traditional medicine (as there is elsewhere in the range), and they are often kept in cages for display purposes (G. Serra pers. comm. 2014). The species is commercially hunted in Morocco for use in traditional medicine, with various parts being used (especially the brain) and may fetch very high prices. Hunters may travel hundreds of kilometres to capture this species (F. Cuzin pers. comm. 2007).","Hofer and Mills (1998b) estimated the total population of striped hyaena at 5,000 to 14,000 individuals (see Table 5.2 in Hofer and Mills 1998b). Such an assessment of the current population trends of the Striped Hyaena is complicated by a number of problems (they are nocturnal, solitary, occur at low densities often in rugged country, sightings are infrequent, and surveys difficult to carry out). Moreover, in areas where the range of the&#160;Striped Hyaena&#160;overlaps with that of the Spotted Hyaena and the Aardwolf, few people acknowledge or recognize a difference between the three hyaenid species. Nonetheless, even if the overall population is larger than this estimate, based on their questionnaire survey, Hofer and Mills (1998b) found that the Striped Hyaena is already extinct in many localities and that populations are generally declining throughout its range.<br/><br/>As noted,&#160;Striped Hyaenas&#160;occur at low population densities. A large study in Laikipia District, central Kenya, estimated the minimum regional density at 0.03 adults/km² (Wagner 2006), while van Aarde <em>et al.</em> (1998) estimated more than 0.016/km² in the Negev Desert (see also Table 5.1 in Hofer and Mills 1998b). Close estimates of 0.011/km²&#160;were found in Lebanon (Abi-Said 2006).",Decreasing,"The Striped Hyaena has a very large, albeit now patchy distribution, extending from Africa, north of and including the Sahel, and including much of east and northeast Africa south to about central Tanzania, through the Middle East and Arabian Peninsula, Turkey, the Caucasus, Central Asia, and the Indian subcontinent, though not reaching Assam, Bhutan or Myanmar. They may have recently expanded into Nepal (Hofer and Mills 1998a). <br/><br/>Although historically present, there are few reliable recent records of occurrence in Sudan, Eritrea, Somalia, Qatar, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates (Andrews 2008, Cunningham 2004, Hofer and Mills 1998a). However, recent records for Syria (Palmyra area and other Syrian governorates; Masseti 2009, A. Shehab pers. comm. 2014, G.

Because they exist outside of formally protected areas in regions where pastoralism is the norm and the potential for human-carnivore conflict is very high (for example, in Egypt and Kenya), particular attention should be paid to identifying ways to reduce human-carnivore conflict through promotion of methods that ensure adequate numbers of prey persist and/or methods that reduce livestock killing by all carnivores (Wagner 2013). Good domestic waste management (Yom-Tov 2003, Qarqaz <em>et al.</em> 2004, Abi-Said and Marrouche Abi-Said 2007, Tourani <em>et al. </em>2012) and a well-designed public awareness program proved to be very successful in changing attitudes to promote conservation in some areas (Abi-Said 2006).",Afrotropical|Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

In southern Africa the Aardwolf occupies diverse habitats, ranging from the karroid habitats of the Western Cape and Eastern Cape, the grasslands and scrub of Botswana, the open savanna woodlands of Zimbabwe, and the inland gravel plains of the Namib Desert in Namibia (Skinner and Chimimba 2005). They have also been recorded at 2,000 m asl in Ethiopia (Yalden <em>et al.</em> 1996). Throughout its distribution, the Aardwolf has been recorded to feed primarily on nasute harvester termites (genus <em>Trinervitermes</em>) and, in any particular region, mainly on one species. Aardwolves are largely independent of water (except during prolonged cold spells), satisfying their moisture requirements from termites (Anderson 2013). Comprehensive reviews of the species' ecology can be found in Koehler and Richardson (1990) and Anderson (2013).","There are currently no major threats to Aardwolves. In South Africa, the Aardwolf was previously persecuted by some farmers for the mistaken belief that it was a predator on livestock, chickens and eggs (Richardson 1984, Anderson 1988). However, such reports are not substantiated by studies of gut or faecal contents and probably result from mistaken identity with hyaenas or jackals (Anderson 2013). Fortunately, this perception has now changed and most farmers actively conserve Aardwolves. They are, however, the occasional inadvertent victims of problem animal control operations, especially those using gin traps (M.D. Anderson pers. obs. 2014).<br/><br/>Loss of habitat, through urbanization and agricultural expansion, may be having an important negative impact. For example, some farmers in South Africa destroy termitaria, using a plough or poisons, and these areas then become unsuitable for Aardwolves. Poisons used for locust control may also have an adverse effect on Aardwolves (Anderson 2013). Additional mortality factors include predation by other carnivores, and accidental road casualties as Aardwolves fail to move out of the way of oncoming vehicles at night (Anderson 2013).","Although relatively widely distributed, the Aardwolf is not common within its range. In prime habitat (open grassland and scrub regions), densities may reach one adult/km² on farms with good populations of termites and no persecution by farmers (Anderson 2013).",Stable,"The Aardwolf has a disjunct distribution in Africa, occurring in two discrete areas, 1,500 km apart, one in east and northeastern Africa and one in southern Africa. Their distribution is largely determined by the distribution of <em>Trinervitermes</em> termites, which constitute their principle food (Anderson 2013).<br/><br/>The northern subspecies extends from central Tanzania to northeastern Uganda, Ethiopia and Somalia, then narrowly along the coast of Eritrea and Sudan to extreme southeastern Egypt (in the Sudan Government Administration Area) (Yalden <em>et al.</em> 1996, Hofer and Mills 1998, Hoath 2003, Anderson 2013). Their presence in Djibouti is unclear (Künzel <em>et al.</em> 2000). A road kill from near Mbatwa in the Udzungwa Mountains of Tanzania in 2002 is probably the most southerly record for the northern subspecies (De Luca and Mpunga 2005). <br/><br/>The southern subspecies ranges over most of southern Africa, extending just into southwest Angola, southern Zambia (apparently south of the Kafue River), and south-west Mozambique, but it is entirely absent from Malawi, southern Tanzania, and most of Zambia (Hofer and Mills 1998, Anderson 2013).

This is inferred from over-exploitation, with habitat fragmentation exacerbating the speed at which the species is being extirpated. Hunting is a severe threat because the species is primarily ground-dwelling and so is exposed to the very high levels of snaring and other forms of ground-level trapping throughout its range. This assessment is made without any direct quantification of decline rate. Two largely sympatric ungulates&#160;of broadly similar generation lengths, Saola <em>Pseudoryx nghetinhensis</em>&#160;and Large-antlered Muntjac <em>Muntiacus vuquangensis</em>, are proposed as Critically Endangered under the same criteria for the same reasons.

These habitats, which contain some areas of very rugged and/or highland terrain into which industrial snaring has not yet widely spread, are apparently not occupied by the two ungulates. If market forces drive intensive snaring also into these habitats, then Critically Endangered would be the appropriate category for future decline rates of Owston's Civet given its apparent rapid extirpation across some heavily snared parts of Viet Nam.","Owston’s Civet occurs in a variety of habitats, all within evergreen biomes, linked by the common feature of a non-harsh dry season. It is, or was, much more widely spread in Viet Nam than in Lao PDR, reflecting the much larger area of Viet Nam with significant humidity in the driest months (i.e., lacking a harsh dry season).&#160;The pattern of locality records in Lao PDR where the species is evidently naturally localised&#160;quite clearly shows that the species has a narrow&#160;habitat usage. Areas with&#160;a non-harsh dry season&#160;in Lao PDR are restricted (Timmins and Trinh 2001).&#160;The areas providing high encounter rates of Owston's Civet in Lao PDR are adjacent to low sections of the Annamite spine (the north-south mountain range forming much of the international border between Lao PDR and Viet Nam) that allow moisture-bearing winds from Viet Nam during Lao PDR's dry season, which in the rest of the country is harsh at lower and mid altitudes (Timmins and Trinh 2001, Duckworth&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010, Sivilay&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011, Coudrat&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). Many other evergreen forest survey areas across the country lack records,&#160;despite the use therein of methods suitable to find the species, at adequate intensities, and the finding of multiple hunting-sensitive ground-dwelling mammals,&#160;It is essentially absent from the predominant evergreen forest types of Lao PDR, lowland, mid-elevation and lower montane semi-evergreen (dry evergreen) and lower montane forests. This is based on spotlighting in several survey areas supporting these forest types in the early - mid 1990s (Duckworth 1997) and on camera-trapping in the 21st century in Phou Sithon, Nakai-Nam Theun National Biodiversity Conservation Area (NBCA), Laving-Laveun NBCA, Nam Kading NBCA, Phou Chomvoy Provincial Protected Area and Xe Sap NBCA (Duckworth&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010,&#160;Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2014, Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014b, R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014); the hunting intensity in all of these at the time of camera-trapping was equivalent to Pu Mat before (sometimes well before) 1998, about when the species was still readily detected by camera-traps. It is evidently locally present in Lao PDR below 1,000 m where wet evergreen forest occurs, but the absence of records from Laving-Laveun NBCA, which holds various other wet&#160;evergreen forest species,&#160;suggests that Owston's Civet is particularly sensitive to climatic conditions. It also occurs in montane evergreen forest (over 1,000 m), but is probably equally restricted by climatic conditions in its geographic and altitudinal range. Montane areas&#160;with wet climates, such as various high peaks in eastern parts of Lao PDR, appear to support the species over a relatively wide range (e.g., Xe Sap NBCA; Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014b), whilst peaks further west (greater rain-shadowing during the winter) appear to support more localised populations (e.g. Nam Et-Phou Louey NBCA; Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2009). Wet evergreen forest is, or was, far more widespread in Viet Nam than in Lao PDR, but it is not universal. The strong evidence from Lao PDR for climatic sensitivity of Owston's Civet suggests that some Viet Namese evergreen forests will hold the species sparsely or not at all (those in a&#160;rain-shadow).&#160;<br/><br/>In the Annamite wet evergreen forest of Lao PDR, Owston's Civet has been recorded as high as suitable survey has occurred (1,500 m; Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014b). The few records from Lao PDR's northern highlands, mostly imprecisely located (barring that in Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2009), are likely to come from higher altitudes where the colder temperatures ameliorate the low dry-season rainfall. Thus, in Lao PDR Owston's Civet is likely to occur&#160;mostly in hill and montane altitudes, although there are credible reports from as low as 550 m (Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014b), whereas in Viet Nam the species has a wide altitudinal range, right down to the plains and up to 2,600 m (Van Ban district, Lao Kay province, in 2002; S. Swan pers. comm. 2014). Recent camera-trap records at&#160;Mu Cang Chai and Muong La, in the northern highlands of Viet Nam, come from altitudes of 1,722-2,444 m a.s.l.; there was very little survey effort below 1,700 m (B.M. Rawson pers, comm. 2014).<br/><br/>Captive animals in both Viet Nam and the U.K. relish earthworms (J. Meek pers. comm. 2014, D.H.A. Willcox pers. comm. 2014) and the species's skull and dentition suggest an invertebrate diet (Thomas 1927). An earthworm-dominated diet would explain the tight linkage with year-round humidity, given that in the parts of Lao PDR with a harsh dry season earthworms are not accessible during that season. This remains purely speculative, especially given that the component of Owston's Civet range south of the northern highlands resembles that of various other species unlikely to depend directly on access to earthworms, e.g. Annamite Striped Rabbit <em>Nesolagus timminsi</em>&#160;and Saola <em>Pseudoryx nghetinhensis</em>.<br/><br/>Suitable forests, in Viet Nam at least, include some on limestone and some dominated by bamboo (Roberton 2007). There are indications from Lao PDR of occurrence in degraded and edge habitat such as banana gardens (King 2002), but these remain to be confirmed. The lack of records from deciduous forest surely reflects the genuine pattern of occurrence.<br/><br/>Owston's Civet has not been studied in the field, but camera-trapping indicates that it is nocturnal, largely solitary and presumably largely active at ground level (e.g., Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2014), although there is at least one record of a wild animal 3 m up a tree (Dang and Le 2010). The species climbs well in captivity (D.H.A. Willcox pers. comm. 2014).","Lao PDR and Viet Nam, the two countries holding most of the geographic range of Owston's Civet, have among the highest levels of non-specific mammal hunting in the world. For many decades hunting with projectiles, dogs, and traps fabricated from local plant materials has been very high, for largely local use. From the late 1980s, rising throughout the 1990s, 2000s and into the 2010s, rapidly increasing affluence of Chinese and Viet Namese consumers and, to a lesser extent, those in Lao PDR has fuelled an explosive rise in urban demand for wildlife meat, including civets (e.g., Bell <em>et al</em>. 2004). In Viet Nam “the free market economy has resulted in feverish periods of trade in wild species nationwide, with negative impacts on biodiversity” (Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam 2004). In Lao PDR, the same situation has developed, largely for export rather than in-country consumption. This demand has resulted in levels of snaring probably unprecedented anywhere in the world, using durable materials (metal) linked by brushwood drift-fences. These are evidently extremely efficient in extirpating mobile ground-dwelling mammals of civet size (e.g., Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2014); some areas of little-degraded forest now support negligible densities of ground-dwelling mammals of this size class and above (Willcox <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Although such trade-driven off-take of large mammals from protected areas and such wildlife trade is unambiguously illegal in both Lao PDR and Viet Nam, enforcement is uneven and the large profits to be made hamper effective resolution of the problem. In parts of Lao PDR, trade prices for wild meat are so high and wild stocks so depleted that severe dietary problems are evident among rural hill people (i.e., those without access rights to productive fisheries) (Krahn and Johnson 2007). There is no reason to expect these hunting levels to decline until the wildlife species affected have been hunted out; larger species such as big cats <em>Panthera</em>, wild cattle <em>Bos</em> and Sambar <em>Rusa unicolor</em> are already widely extirpated in Viet Nam and Lao PDR (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014), yet hunting continues. Some Viet Namese areas camera-trapped and discussed by Willcox <em>et al</em>. (2014) were almost bereft of any ground-dwelling mammals or birds bigger than rats. This is the plausible end-point for most areas holding Owston's Civet.<br/><br/>By contrast, Owston's Civet seems to be fairly resilient to long-standing hunting methods and intensities, judging by the numbers that were and still are camera-trapped in in Viet Nam's northern highlands (Swan and O'Reilly 2004, S. Swan pers. comm. 2004, B.M. Rawson pers. comm. 2014). In contrast to Owston's Civet, many other hunting-sensitive species in these areas were or are already extirpated or reduced to numbers so low as to evade detection. This area has no or negligible trade-driven operation of metal snares in long lines; this lack is typical of Hmong-dominated northern highland areas (J. Tordoff pers. comm. 2014). Most hunting for mammals of civet-size and over in these areas is active, with projectiles and with dogs,&#160;rather than by passive trapping; and it is&#160;by day (B. Long pers comm. 2014). The nocturnal, solitary, generally inconspicuous habits of Owston's Civet evidently facilitate its survival in such areas; its dens must be in areas not readily found by dogs.<br/><br/>Habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation have affected large areas of Owston’s Civet range (Schreiber <em>et al</em>. 1989), particularly in Viet Nam and increasingly in Lao PDR. Habitat fragmentation magnifies the impact of hunting on populations, particularly when roads are built into areas of, until then, limited accessibility. Vehicle access makes the harvest of a whole host of mid-price marketable materials such as civet meat economically viable where previously the labour investment of carrying heavy loads long distances restrained off-take in those areas to high-value products and what was required for living off the land during the process. An ongoing massive expansion of the road system in Lao PDR, in part related to large infrastructure construction such as dams and mines (e.g., Sivilay <em>et al</em>. 2011, W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. 2014), is likely to bring most of the Lao areas holding Owston's Civet within close-enough range of vehicle access that general wildlife meat extraction is economically feasible. This is already the case for most of the Viet Namese areas.<br/><br/>The exceptions to this grim assessment include karst massifs (into which road building is rarely economically viable), montane areas inhabited by people who disdain snaring, and any protected areas which develop effective enough management regimes before the species is extirpated. While there are Owston's Civet records form karst, densities within such landscapes are unknown, as is the degree to which the&#160;species&#160;depends upon tall forests there (themselves rather patchy in occurrence in karst landscapes). The extent to which industrial snaring will spread into hill areas already largely depleted of animals larger than civets (by day-time shooting and hunting with dogs), notably large areas of the northern highlands, is unclear; if some such areas do not start to deploy it (for various reasons, such as ongoing remoteness from road networks, or the cultural predispositions of the inhabitants), these areas will also be important havens to Owston's Civet.<br/><br/>The adaptability of Owston's Civet to non-hunted degraded and fragmented areas is unknown, but so long as snaring remains uncontrolled, is moot.","The total population of Owston's Civet will always have been much smaller than that of most other mainland South-east Asian civets because it has such a small geographic range. There is insufficient&#160;baseline information to define the precise&#160;range and even the general abundance in the era before trade-driven hunting began to accelerate steeply in the 1980s with the increasingly wide deployment of cable-snares in long lines linked by brushwood drift fences. Therefore, its population trend needs to be inferred from trends in habitat and in hunting (types, distributions and intensities), based on a hypothesised geographic and ecological distribution, itself inferred from habitat (from which the known precisely located records come) and distributions of ecologically restricted co-occurring species.<br/><br/>Severe declines probably started in the early 1990s, Around this time, evidence suggests other ground-dwelling, now much-declined, Annamite-centred species such as Saola <em>Pseudoryx nghetinhensis</em>, Large-antlered Muntjac <em>Muntiacus vuquangensis</em> and&#160;Edwards’s Pheasant <em>Lophura edwardsii</em>&#160;were, by today’s standards, still common in accessible Viet Namese forests. Camera-trapping in the late 1990s in Pu Mat Nature Reserve and in Huong Son district (SFNC 2000, Timmins and Trinh 2001) suggested that the species was still relatively common in mid-elevation forests where hunting pressure was already relatively intense. The number of animals in trade in the 1990s (e.g., at Ban Lak-20 (= Ban Lak Xao) in Lao PDR; received by the Owston’s Civet Project at&#160;Cuc Phuong National Park, Viet Nam; and observed in trade near Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park and as&#160;stuffed specimens along route 1, both Viet Nam) all suggest the species was frequent thereabouts, presumably in the mid-elevation forest where the bulk of snaring was then taking place. There is no pointer, when the difficulties of detecting this species by typical pre-camera-trap surveys are accounted for, to suggest that Owston’s Civet was not a common species throughout mid-elevation Vietnamese wet evergreen forest (see 'Habitats and ecology' section), prior to the advent of intensive snaring.<br/><br/>Within its range, it evidently reached, and locally still reaches, high densities within favoured habitat. Bourret (1944) considered it to be the most common civet between the Fansipan mountains and the Black river in northern Viet Nam. Two camera-trapping surveys in Viet Nam around the turn of the century, one in the Hoang Lien mountains in the north-west of the country and the other in Pu Mat Nature Reserve in the northern Annamites found this civet to be among the most commonly photographed small carnivores in these areas (SFNC 2000, S. Swan pers. comm. 2004). Pu Mat NR has not been resurveyed, but this assessment&#160;is still appropriate for the highland areas of Mu Cang Chai and Muong La, both in/near the Hoan Lien mountains, in 2013 camera-trapping (B.M. Rawson pers. comm. 2014). The same was found in 2012-2013 in Xe Sap National Protected Area, Lao PDR (Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014b) and during the preceding decade in parts of eastern Nakai-Nam Theun NPA (Coudrat&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). In some other areas that it has been found, it has been among the least recorded species by camera-trap, e.g. Quang Nam province, Viet Nam (Long and Minh 2006), western Nakai-Nam Theun NPA (Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2014), and Nam Et-Phou Louey NPA in the northern highlands of Lao PDR (Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2009). The patterns&#160;of the other hunting-sensitive species recorded by these surveys suggest that Owston's Civet abundance is highly heterogeneous dependent upon habitat, not that the low encounter rates in these areas are&#160;solely a result of overhunting (although this&#160;might be responsible in part or whole for the low encounter rate in Quang Nam).<br/><br/>However, hunting is likely to be the explanation for the stark temporal pattern shown by the review of camera-trapping in Viet Nam by Willcox <em>et al</em>. (2014: Table SOM3). Of the five camera-trapping surveys operating in Viet Nam during&#160;1998–2006, all found Owston’s &#160;Civet; the four in 2006–2013 all did not. (Two additional sites surveyed in the latter period, Cat Tien NP and U Minh, also did not find&#160;Owston’s Civet but are excluded from the comparison as being outside the species's likely range.) Very recent (late 2013) camera-trapping in Ngoc Linh Nature Reserve (Kon Tum province, Viet Nam) and two northern highland sites,&#160;Mu Cang Chai and Muong La, found Owston's Civet to be one of most commonly photographed small carnivores (Nguyen T. pers. comm. 2014,&#160;B.M. Rawson pers. comm. 2014). These anomalies within the 2006-2013 time period, not available in time for the Willcox <em>et al</em>. (2014) review, are both in very mountainous areas consequently less economically appealing to market hunters. Higher hunting pressures, notably snaring intensities, typify most of the survey areas included in Willcox <em>et al</em>. (2014: Table SOM3). Excepting the results from Ngoc Linh NR,&#160;Mu Cang Chai and Muong La, the lack of Viet Namese records from 2006 onwards suggests a major recent decline in the species in sites across the country with large populations&#160;left only in forested steep highland massifs. This suspected decline&#160;is corroborated by the failure of over 15,000 camera-trap-nights of effort in wet evergreen forest (see 'Habitats and ecology' section) in the Hue and Quang Nam Saola Reserves, Viet Nam, since August 2012 to find the species (WWF pers. comm. to Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014b). Nor has it been found in another lowland area of wet&#160;evergreen forest, Khe Nuoc Truong in Quang Binh province, where extensive camera-trapping recorded many other small carnivore species (Le Trong Trai pers. comm. 2014). For none of these 2006-2013 Viet Nam camera-trap survey areas is there evidence of a pre-intensive-snaring large population of Owston' Civet. However, assessing them based on habitat and other Annamite wet evergreen forest species' status (see 'Habitats and ecology' section; R.J. Timmins [pers. comm. 2014] has&#160;surveyed in most of them and studied all on aerial imagery), Khe Nuoc Truong, Hoang Son, and non-limestone forests in the Phong Nha-Ke Bang area,&#160;are&#160;probably&#160;prime Owston’s Civet habitat; Hue and Quang Nam Saola Nature Reserves are very similar to Pu Mat NR; and Ke Go is hard to know, because few other sites are topographically similar, and the topography influences local climate. Even Crested Argus&#160;<em>Rheinardia ocellata</em>&#160;(among the least hunting-sensitive ground-dwelling wet evergreen forest species)&#160;has not been camera-trapped in the&#160;Hue and Quang Nam Saola Reserves;&#160;they are some of the most heavily hunted large forest blocks that R.J. Timmins (pers. comm. 2014) has&#160;ever been to.<br/><br/>A decline of such magnitude was not suspected during the last Red List assessment for this species, for 2008. At that stage, all camera-trap surveys within its range typically found the species, sometimes commonly. The high encounter rates in some areas suggests a high starting population and thus a long time until near extirpation (and the concomitant ability of generalised camera-trapping to note a paucity of records). Another factor weighed for the 2008 listing as Vulnerable was that one of the surveys camera-trapping the species commonly, in Hoang Lien Son of far northern Viet Nam, was amid highly degraded and fragmented forest which had been subjected to high levels of traditional hunting for decades (see Swan and O'Reilly 2004) and thus the species was resilient to hunting pressure. However, it now seems more likely that Owston's Civet differs in sensitivity to different styles of hunting (see 'Threats'). The current overall population trend is thus assessed to be steeply downwards. Probably, the main phase of decline in Viet Nam has already occurred, with most areas holding the species there now having only low numbers with large populations persisting only in the northern highlands and most rugged part of the Annamites, Lao PDR, retaining much larger areas of forest without road incursion and a much lower human population, still retains at least one large population, plausibly several (Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014b), but the national trend in 2015-2030 is likely to replicate that of Viet Nam in 1999-2014.<br/><br/>No information on the present population status in the Chinese part of the range was traced. Indeed, it is not clear that the species is still extant there.",Decreasing,"Owston's Civet is known to occur across a wide latitudinal range of both eastern Lao PDR (Sivilay&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011, Coudrat&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014, Gray&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014b) and Viet Nam (Roberton&#160;2007,&#160;Dang and Le 2010), and in a small area of southernmost China, possibly only in Hekou, Luchun and Jinping counties of Yunnan province (Wang Ying-xiang 2003) but perhaps also in adjacent Guangxi province (Lau <em>et al</em>. 2010). It has not been found west of the Mekong river (Corbet and Hill 1992) and indeed occurrence in Lao PDR is restricted largely to the easternmost areas that have similarities in climate to Viet Nam. The range may also potentially extend into easternmost Cambodia: two individuals seen in the Phnom Tamao zoo (Phnom Penh) collection of stuffed mounts in the late 1990s were unlikely to have originated outside Cambodia (C.M. Poole pers. comm. to Dang and Le 2010). However, extensive surveys in Cambodia's eastern provinces have not found the species (e.g., Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014a, E.H.B. Pollard pers. comm. 2012). Perhaps the most likely area of Cambodia, eastern Virachey National Park, remains very little camera-trapped. Suitable methodology (camera-trapping and/or spotlighting) has been applied widely enough in the southern half of Lao PDR to be confident the species is entirely or largely restricted to the east in the south and latitudinal centre; capable searches have been less widespread in the northern highlands.<br/><br/>Records come from the range 100-2,600 m, but, particularly west of the Annamites, only a subset of this full range is likely to be occupied in any given area (see 'Habitats and ecology').","Owston's Civet is taken for meat and traditional medicine (including its bones, scent gland, and penis) in all of its range countries; there is not suspected to be any targeted hunting of the species, but much hunting in its range is non-selective (e.g. snares) to supply the general wildlife meat market (Sivilay <em>et al</em>. 2011,&#160;B. Long&#160;pers. comm. 2006,&#160;S.I. Roberton pers. comm. 2006).",Terrestrial,"Owston's Civet is listed as Endangered on the China Red List and as Vulnerable in the Viet Nam Red Book (MOSTE 2000). It is protected in Yunnan province, but not in Guangxi (GMA Small Carnivore Workshop 2006). In Viet Nam the species is listed in group IIB meaning exploitation is regulated but not prohibited (Decree 32/2006/ND-CP). In Lao PDR, the species is listed in group I (Prohibition category) of the hunting regulations (Prime Minister Decree 81, 2008; Wildlife hunting regulation).<br/><br/>An international breeding programme, coordinated from Viet Nam, has been established with populations in Europe and Viet Nam. However numbers are still too low for long-term viability (J. Meek pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>Owston's Civet has been recorded in many protected areas in Viet Nam and several in Lao PDR (Roberton 2007, Sivilay <em>et al</em>. 2011, Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2014, Gray&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014b) but in none of these is trade-driven snaring yet under effective control. They have, however, somewhat to greatly slowed the expansion of the road system, and thus maintained areas in which it is only marginally economically viable to harvest wildlife meat in bulk; and they have reduced the chance of landscape-level habitat transformation projects such as concession plantations.",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

The rate of habitat loss (very significant in the species' key western forest heartland in the Menabe region) and hunting has increased significantly with the breakdown of governance since the coup d'etat in 2009, leading to increased artisanal mining, increased hunting and increased opportunistic rosewood cutting throughout the species' range, suggesting that there will be a further population drop of 30%, or more, over the next three generations.","The Fosa is active both arboreally and on the ground. Its diet is known to include many animals in forests it inhabits, including lemurs to the size of Diademed Sifaka <em>Propithecus diadema</em> (body weight about 3 kg), rodents and reptiles (Rasolonandrasana 1994, S.M. Goodman and L. Dollar&#160;pers. comm. 2007, F. Hawkins pers. comm.). Lemurs are frequently caught in trees. The gestation period is six to seven weeks after which between two and four young are born (Hawkins 2003); because infants remain with the mother for the first year, females only breed every other year. Sexual maturity is reached at three or four years of age (Hawkins 2003) and it is maximum known age in captivity is more than 20 years.&#160;<br/><br/>In northeast Madagascar, Fosa was&#160;camera-trapped&#160;in contiguous, non-degraded, fragmented and highly degraded forest sites; perhaps with&#160;a lower activity and probability of occupancy in contiguous, core rainforest areas&#160;(Farris&#160;<em>et al</em>. in review a, Z. Farris pers. comm. 2014). In degraded forest, Fosas were often photographed on trails near the forest edge, which they probably used at night to travel to villages to hunt for livestock (Farris and Kelly 2011, Farris <em>et al</em>. in review a).&#160;<br/><br/>The Fosa is solitary for the majority of the year; however, pairs have often been photographed near the breeding season (October-December). There is record of what appeared to be an adult travelling with a juvenile in May, and another of a very small Fosa (possibly an infant or very early juvenile) in September.&#160;<br/><br/>The Fosa is primarily nocturnal with some daytime activity throughout the year (Farris <em>et al</em>. in review b). There was strict nocturnality at sites with high human and dog activity, suggesting that these species may influence Fosa activity. There was more day-time activity during the peak breeding season (October-December; Farris <em>et al</em>. in review b).","The major threats to Fosa are hunting for food and the loss and fragmentation of forest habitat, largely caused by the conversion of forested areas to agricultural land and pasture; selective logging degrades the habitat.&#160;&#160;<br/><br/>Household surveys (Farris <em>et al</em>. in review a) found 99 Fosas reportedly consumed within four villages (144 households were surveyed) from 2005 to 2011 across the Makira Natural Park. Hunting rates were highest in non-degraded forest and were positively associated with Fosa occupancy, meaning that hunters appear to be focusing their efforts in non-degraded forest where Fosa is most abundant. Golden <em>et al</em> (in press) report four Fosas hunted in one year at Betampona Strict Nature Reverve, two hunted opportunistically (presumably with dogs).&#160;Household interviews conducted by Madagasikara Voakajy (pers. comm. 2014) in the Moramanga region of eastern Madagascar between 2008 and 2009 suggest that 325 (21%) of 1,535 respondents interviewed in 129 villages had eaten Fosa in the preceding year.&#160; <br/><br/>Hunting is presumed to have increased significantly in many parts of the  species' range since 2009 because of less effective&#160;governance and  increased social instability following a coup d'etat. <br/><br/>Deforestation and forest disturbance across the range of the Fosa has increased significantly since 2009. R. Rajaonson (pers. comm. 2014) estimates that deforestation in eastern forest increased from 0.5% per annum in 2005-2010 to 0.94% per annum in 2010-2013. Allnut <em>et al</em>. (2009) estimated that in Masoala National Park, annual rates of deforestation in the studied area increased to 1.27% per annum in 2011. High levels of illegal settlement in protected areas, especially around the Bay of d'Antongil, are linked to artisanal mining (for quartz) and logging of rosewood; hunting for food using dogs has increased greatly in these areas as a result. Some villages have seen increases in populations of between 200 and 300% (C. Golden pers. comm. 2014). Around Ranomafana National Park, Fosa is&#160;absent from forest fragments more than 15 km from core habitat and is&#160;about equally often detected in degraded and primary habitats (Gerber <em>et al</em>. 2012)<br/><br/>In western Madagascar, Zinner <em>et al</em>. (2014) showed that for central Menabe, one of the most important centres of&#160;Fosa&#160;distribution, deforestation rates of 0.78 km<sup>2</sup>/yr in 2003-2006 increased to 1.09&#160;km<sup>2</sup>/yr in 2006-2008, and to 2.55&#160;km<sup>2</sup>/yr by 2008-2010. There is ample evidence that the increase continued in 2010-2014, coupled with increased illegal logging and hunting in the core forest areas, which will undoubtedly negatively effect populations of all native carnivores, especially through the increased presence of dogs.&#160;<br/><br/>The Fosa&#160;also preys on domestic fowl and is consequently killed as a pest by local people. It seems very susceptible to hunting, and is often targeted by groups engaged in collective group hunting (e.g. in the Makira forests) specifically for the purpose of eradication. Its parts are used for medicinal purposes. Competition with introduced carnivores occurs, including predation by feral dog packs. The Fosa seems&#160;to be&#160;more nocturnal when in the same areas as highly active&#160;diurnal people and dogs. High nocturnal activity overlaps with activity of both Small Indian Civet <em>Viverricula indica</em>&#160;and feral/wild cats, revealing the potential for increased interactions and competition (Farris <em>et al</em>. in review b).<p>Many camera-trap photographs of Fosas show animals carrying nooses from make-shift traps, and many show individuals with numerous scars and missing body parts (ears, lips, tails) which reportedly result from locals trying to kill them with machetes when they raid their livestock.</p>","The Fosa is generally a solitary species that is found at low population densities (Hawkins 2003). Density estimates are&#160;0.26 individuals/km<sup>2</sup> for the Menabe region&#160;(Hawkins 1998), and 0.20/km<sup>2</sup>&#160;for Ankarafantsika&#160;(Rahajanirina 2003). The maximum estimated population size for the largest protected area in Madagascar (Masoala National Park) is 414 breeding adults, and this is likely to be a substantial overestimate. Metapopulations of more than this may be possible, given the ability of this species to range between forest patches. Connectivity of populations between distant forest fragments is not yet conclusively known. <br/><br/>Densities for the eastern forests are hypothesised by some to be at one-third those&#160;of the west, based on photo-trapping and cage trapping efforts throughout the humid forests (L. Dollar pers. comm. 2007). Subjective encounter rate is much higher in the western forests (particularly in Menabe, Bemaraha and Ankarana reserves) than in rainforests (F. Hawkins&#160;pers. comm.), but densities could well be similar between dry and humid forests. This is an important point for future investigation. Important determinants of density&#160;may include densities of lemur prey species, and levels of hunting.<br/>  <p>Gerber <em>et al</em>. (2012) estimated the total Fosa&#160;population&#160;at between 2,635 (the population estimated to occur in protected areas) and 8,626 adults. Of the upper estimate, 4,476 are estimated to be in 32 populations in rainforest, and 4,150 in 38 populations in dry forest. In their estimation, 95% of the rainforest population occurred in forest blocks north of Andasibe-Perinet; the only protected areas in this region capable of holding more than 300 adult Fosas are Vohidrazana-Zahamena and Makira-Masoala. Around 95% of the dry forest population was in nine large forest blocks, of which only two could hold more than 300 individuals. </p>  <p>Gerber <em>et al</em>. (2012) found Fosa&#160;densities around Ranomafana National Park to be similar in primary forest (0.12 ± SE 0.05 individuals/km<sup>2</sup>) and logged forest (0.09 ± SE 0.04), and found the species in forest fragments 2.5 km from intact forest, although not in fragments 15 km from intact forest.</p>  <p>In northeast Madagascar, camera trap surveys by Farris (<em>et al</em>. in review a, pers. comm. 2014) found a high probability of occupancy (defined as the probability that a site/forest is occupied by the species of interest while taking into account the variation in detectability of the species across the various sites) of 0.68 ±&#160;SE&#160;0.08 for Fosa across the Masoala-Makira landscape. Fosas had similar probabilities of occupancy in non-degraded forest (0.66 SE ± 0.06) and degraded forest (0.68 SE ± 0.13). Surveys at one contiguous forest site showed little to no change in Fosa occupancy (0.79 to 0.85) between 2008 and 2013 (trap success [number of captures divided by trap nights multiplied by 100] changed from 3.04 in 2008 to 3.42 in 2013). However, at another survey site, trap success decreased from 7.16 (2011) to 3.43 (2013) over a three-year period (Z. Farris&#160;pers. comm. 2014). Fosa occurred in forest fragments at Farankarina managed area, separated by at least 5 km from both Makira and Masoala National Parks, as well as in additional smaller fragmented forest patches. The smallest fragmented forest patch Fosa was recorded in was the 8&#160;km<sup>2&#160;</sup>Farankarina managed area (-15.422, 49.837), which lies at least 5 km from both Masola and Makira forests. Fosa was also observed moving through anthropogenic landscapes.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Fosa is the most widely distributed of the Malagasy carnivores, found throughout western and eastern forests, although it is very scarce in most areas; it is also present, although rare, in forests on the central plateau and in spiny southern forests.

45201218,14027,Mustela strigidorsa,Least Concern,,2016,2015-03-03 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Stripe-backed Weasel is listed as Least Concern in view of its wide distribution, presumed large population, occurrence in many protected areas, and apparent tolerance to high levels of habitat modification and hunting pressure. Although forest clearance rate are heavy in South-east Asia, they are considerably lower in hill forests (the main habitat of this species) than in the level lowlands (where it is rare); similarly, trade-driven hunting is least pervasive in such habitats. Because of these factors, it is unlikely to be declining at the rate required for listing even as Near Threatened.","Stripe-backed Weasel probably lives mainly in evergreen forests in hills and mountains, but has been recorded from other biotopes including dense scrub, secondary forest, grassland and farmland (Abramov <em>et al.</em>&#160;2008). Most records come from in or near larger extents of high elevation (1,000 m+) terrain. It sometimes occurs well below 1,000 m in such areas (down almost to sea-level in Viet Nam), but there are no records, except in Viet Nam, from lower elevations in areas away from high altitude terrain (Abramov <em>et al.</em> 2008). It is probably diurnal and mostly solitary. Conventional camera-trapping is not particularly efficient at finding it even when it is&#160;known by other methods to be present (Than Zaw <em>et al</em>. 2008, Chutipong&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2014).","Although Stripe-backed Weasel was usually perceived as a species under threat, this stems from the limited relevant survey effort for most of the 20th century across most of its range. Even though this weasel lacks high economic value, and villagers in at least central Lao PDR say it has a bad taste and smell (C.N.Z. Coudrat pers. comm. 2014), hunting could in theory drive declines because many harvest methods (notably snares) used widely in its range are non-selective. As remaining natural habitats are yet further encroached, the proportion of the species’s occupied area in which it faces such threats will increase. However, the number of records from areas with already high hunting pressure indicate a resilience to such activities (Abramov <em>et al.</em> 2008, Willcox <em>et al</em>. 2014: Table SOM3).&#160;This does not mean that hunting-driven declines might not be occurring locally; this is most likely to be so in Viet Nam, looking at patterns of ground-level snaring pressure. Even in this case, the paucity of salvage records from snare lines suggests that weasels are only rarely caught: plausibly they move through the brush-wood drift fences (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014) and, given that the snare-lines usually run across relatively open understorey, weasels perhaps avoid these areas anyway (D.H.A. Willcox&#160;pers. comm. 2014).&#160;Ongoing forest encroachment is fairly heavy across the species's range, but the locations&#160;of records suggest the species is fairly tolerant to degradation and fragmentation. While there are no records from entirely deforested landscapes, because this seems to be primarily a species of hill evergreen forest, range-wide total forest clearance rates are low.","In view of the overall rather limited survey effort in much of its range, the number of recent records of Stripe-backed Weasel indicates that it is less rare than previously believed (Abramov <em>et al.</em> 2008).  Globally, there are several dozen historical specimens, their number significantly under-estimated in various 1960s-1990s texts thereby giving a misleading impression of rarity. Recent sight-records strongly support the notion that it was previously much overlooked (e.g. Abramov&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008, Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014). Notably, in Lao PDR, this species was historically found only once, at Phongsali (Delacour 1940), but by contrast there are recent records from all but a couple of the blocks of hill semi-evergreen and evergreen forest which have had wildlife surveys exceeding a few weeks and using appropriate methodology (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Tizard 2003, Abramov <em>et al</em>. 2008,&#160;Streicher&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010, Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2014).",Stable,"Stripe-backed Weasel is found from Sikkim (India) east through southern China (Yunnan, Guizhou and Guangxi provinces), North-east India and north and central South-east Asia to Viet Nam (Abramov <em>et al</em>. 2008). Formerly thought to be restricted in South-east Asia to the north and centre, a recent record from Thailand is from far to the south, near Kuiburi National Park at&#160;12°06′N, 99°44′E (Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014). It presumably occurs also in&#160;Bhutan, although&#160;Abramov&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2008) traced no records from the country.&#160;As of late 2014, there are no records from Bangladesh (Hasan Rahman pers comm. 2014), although it seems likely to occur in the evergreen forests of the north-east.&#160;There are two old specimens catalogued as from ‘Nepal’ (i.e., west of the validated world range), but they probably did not come from within the boundaries of the modern country (Hinton and Fry 1923).&#160;Thapa (2014) listed the species for Nepal without caveat, but confirmed subsequently that he knows of no specific records from the country (S. Thapa pers. comm. 2014).&#160;This species has a wide recorded altitudinal range of 90 to 2,500 m (Abramov <em>et al</em>. 2008).","About 3,000 to 4,000&#160;Stripe-backed Weasel&#160;pelts were harvested annually in China in the 1970s, with 50 skins were purchased in Nanning, Guangxi, in 1973 (Sheng 1998). The skins/dried corpses were seen “2-5 times” (the middle class of frequency) in a survey of wildlife trade along the Yunnan-Viet Nam border in June-August 1997; the source was said to be Yunnan (Li and Wang 1999). Outside China, the species is sold at least occasionally in Lao PDR (Hansel and Tizard 2006) and Viet Nam. Outside China, the only occasional records of Stripe-backed Weasel in trade, or hunted and destined for local use. all indicate that across most of its range this weasel lacks high economic value and is not specifically sought.",Terrestrial,"There are no obvious conservation needs for Stripe-backed Weasel. Habitat-driven decline rates are fairly low, given its presence in degraded and fragmented forests and the high proportion of its population in hill and mountain areas with relatively low rates of forest conversion. Moreover, except possibly for pelts in China, it is not a targeted quarry species (Abramov <em>et al</em>. 2008). It has been recorded in many protected areas across its range and it is likely that it occurs, as yet undetected, in many of those so far remaining little surveyed (Abramov <em>et al</em>. 2008, Chutipong&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2014). Many of these protected areas have little real protection from hunting and small-scale habitat loss and in the long term, the species's chief conservation concern is probably the risk of insufficient real security of declared&#160;protected areas.&#160;It&#160;is listed as Endangered on the China Red List (Wang and Xie 2004) and is protected in Thailand.",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

It&#160;is close to listing as Near Threatened&#160;because over the course  of the next three generations (taken as&#160;20 years),&#160;it is likely that&#160;the population will drop by more than than 15% (and possibly much more) mainly because of  widespread hunting, persecution and the effects of introduced carnivores. The rate of hunting has  increased significantly recently because of the&#160;breakdown of governance  since the coup d'etat in 2009, leading to increased artisanal mining in  forest areas,  increased hunting, and increased opportunistic rosewood cutting  throughout the species's&#160;range. If this&#160;deteriorates&#160;yet further, it is&#160;likely that a&#160;Near Threatened listing will be warranted.","This largely terrestrial, diurnal species is present in tropical humid lowland and montane forest, and tropical dry deciduous forest in the west of its range. An agile climber, it has occassionally been seen in trees, and it is also an adept swimmer. It has been recorded preying on crayfish in freshwater (Dunham 1997). It is recorded from secondary forests, although only where immediately adjacent to primary forest, and can be found at the forest edge, close to areas of slash-and-burn cultivation.&#160;<br/><br/>Ring-tailed Vontsira was more active and had a higher probability of occupancy in degraded forest sites; however, occupancy diminished closer to villages. This negative association with villages may be a reflection of intense hunting pressure (Farris and Kelly 2011, Farris <em>et al</em>. 2012,&#160;Farris&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;in review a).&#160;<br/><br/>In one survey area, Ring-tailed Vontsira was primarily camera-trapped in duos. It was primarily diurnal, with some crepuscular and limited nocturnal activity perhaps related to seasonal changes (Farris <em>et al</em>. in review b).<br/><br/>This species is known to scavenge&#160;regularly&#160;in human refuse in primary forest camps. Animals typically spend the night in burrows in the forest. Although sometimes solitary, it is a social species usually found in pairs with up to three offspring (Dunham 1998). The gestation period is unclear, but it appears to be between 52 and 90 days, after which a single young is born (Goodman 2003). Sexual maturity is attained at about two years.","Ring-tailed Vontsira remains widespread, occurs in a number of protected areas and even persists in forest fragments. As with most forest-dwelling animals in Madagascar, deforestation to cultivated land, hunting and negative effect of introduced carnivores are the most important threats.&#160;<br/><br/>Deforestation and forest disturbance across its range has increased significantly since 2009. R. Rajaonson (pers. comm. 2014) estimates that deforestation in eastern forest increased from 0.5% per annum in 2005-2010 to 0.94% per annum in 2010-2013. Allnut <em>et al</em>. (2009) estimated that in Masoala National Park, annual rates of deforestation in the studied area increased to 1.27% per annum in 2011. High levels of illegal settlement in protected areas, especially around the Bay of Antongil, are linked to artisanal mining (for quartz) and logging of rosewood, and hunting for food using dogs has increased greatly in these areas as a result. Some villages have seen increases in populations of between 200 and 300% (C. Golden pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>This species is persecuted for raiding local poultry (Golden 2005) and is&#160;killed by dogs accompanying hunters in the forest. Hunting and/or bushmeat consumption presents a serious concern for Ring-tailed Vontsira across the eastern rainforest. Golden <em>et al</em>. (in press) reported 21 Ring-tailed Vontsiras hunted in one year at Betampona Strict Nature Reserve. In the Makira landscape a total of 169&#160;Ring-tailed Vontsiras were consumed within four villages (144 households) from 2005 to 2011 near the Makira Natural Park. Hunting rates were positively associated with&#160;Ring-tailed Vontsira&#160;occupancy, meaning hunters appear to be focusing their efforts in non-degraded forest where it is most abundant. In addition, Ring-tailed Vontsira consistently was the most purchased and most trapped small carnivore across the landscape, which is likely to reflect its overall apparent abundance and higher level of activity in and around anthropogenic areas (Farris <em>et al</em>. in review a).<br/><br/>Household interviews conducted by Madagasikara Voakajy (pers. comm. 2014) in the Moramanga region of eastern Madagascar in 2008-2009 suggested that 385 (24%) of 1,631 respondents interviewed in 129 villages had eaten Ring-tailed Vontsira in the preceding year. Certain parts of the animal (e.g. the tail) are used for cultural purposes by some tribal groups (Goodman 2003). Competition with the introduced Small Indian Civet&#160;<em>Viverricula indica</em> and feral cats and dogs may threaten this species in parts of its range. Ring-tailed Vontsira had very strong temporal activity overlap with dogs and moderate overlap with feral/wild cats, revealing the potential for increased interactions and competition (Farris <em>et al</em>. in review b).&#160;<br/><br/>Co-occurrence models demonstrate that the Vontsira does not occur at sites where Small Indian Civet activity is very high, and that Vontsira probability of occupancy is greatly decreased in the presence of Small Indian Civets (Farris&#160;<em>et al</em>. in review c).","<p>The available information suggests that Ring-tailed Vontsira is common. Gerber <em>et al</em>.

African Palm Civets were the most common carnivore recorded  in two markets in Equatorial Guinea (Juste <em>et al</em>. 1995) as well as in Guinea (Colyn <em>et al</em>. 2004). In Gabon, it was the second most numerous species in village offtakes and the most numerous species in bushmeat markets, where it was three times more common than any other carnivore species (Bahaa-el-din <em>et al.</em> 2013). There, African Palm Civets are killed in retaliation for poultry depredation near villages and for traditional medicine (L. Bahaa-el-din pers. obs.). None of this offtake is believed to be threatening at the population level.","This species is widespread and locally abundant, and probably the most common African forest small carnivoran (Van Rompaey and Ray 2013).

However, this does not exclude that the species might be at risk in the southern portion of its range. Given the high relative proportion of its total range that is shared with Large-toothed Ferret Badger, it is conceivable that it could be declining fast enough over enough of its range to qualify for Near Threatened or even Vulnerable, but there is no even weak evidence to suggest this. When the geographic and ecological distribution of Small-toothed Ferret Badger in South-east Asia is clarified, it warrants a review of conservation status given that hunting and habitat encroachment are both widespread and locally heavy.","The habitat use of&#160;Small-toothed Ferret Badger&#160;in&#160;South-east Asia&#160;is unclear (e.g. Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999). Some certainly located records in Viet Nam and Lao PDR are from within little-degraded evergreen forest (Roberton 2007, Robichaud 2010, Abramov and Rozhnov&#160;2014) but at least in Viet Nam ferret badgers of one or more species occur widely in degraded habitats as well. Given the use of farmland landscapes (with woodland copses) in China (e.g., Wang and Fuller 2003), such anthropogenic landscapes might be used in South-east Asia as well. In China it is also occupies broad-leaved forest (e.g., Zhou <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>Small-toothed Ferret Badger&#160;is fossorial and lives in pre-existing holes (including rodent dens, firewood stacks, open fields, and rock piles around houses (Wang and Fuller 2003), rather than digging new ones (Taylor 1989). It is largely nocturnal (Wang and Fuller 2003) and feeds primarily on small animals such as insects, earthworms (Qian <em>et al.</em> 1976, Chuang and Lee 1997), snails, frogs, and sometimes carcases of small birds and mammals, eggs, and fruit (Chian and Sheng 1976, Long and Killingley 1983, Ewer 1985, Neal 1986, Chuang 1994). Resting home range size was found to be 10.6 ha (Wang and Fuller 2003).<br/><br/>Almost all pregnant females were found between March and October during a study on the reproduction of this species on Taiwan (Pei and Wang 1995). Litter size is two, and evidence suggests that it breeds&#160;once a year (Pei and Wang 1995). This species is often found near human habitations (Storz and Wozencraft 1999), taking shelter during the day, and earthworms (the most important part of its diet) are most abundant in the fertile vegetable gardens and farmland soils where this species frequently forages (Wang and Fuller 2003).  It is also sometimes invited into native huts to exterminate cockroaches and other insects (Storz and Wozencraft 1999).","In North-east India the genus is hunted for food (A.U. Choudhury pers. comm. 2007) and this is true across most or all of its range. In southern China this species has historically been one of the most important furbearers and is subjected to heavy harvest pressure (Shou 1962, Sheng 1993, Storz and Wozencraft 1999) and declines have occurred because of this (Lau <em>et al.</em>&#160;2010). However, even in southern China the genus, apparently mostly this species, remains common and widespread&#160;(Lau&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010). In the northern part of its range, in central China, because this species is perceived neither to prey on livestock, nor cause to damage to property or farm facilities, it is not persecuted, despite its close proximity to people (Wang and Fuller 2003). In addition, the value of an individual pelt is not high, although the meat is eaten in some areas (Wang and Fuller 2003). Also in the Chinese part of its range there seems to be little threat from habitat change, given the species's occurrence in highly anthropogenic environments. Understanding threats further south in its range, where it is or might be sympatric with Large-toothed Ferret Badger, is forestalled by the difficulties of identification to species. Ferret badgers of one or more species are among the most widely camera-trapped small carnivores in Viet Nam, including in very heavily hunted areas where most species are now rare (Willcox <em>et al</em>. 2014); perhaps the species is as resilient in South-east Asia as it is further north.","Small-toothed Ferret Badger in general seems to be relatively common, although this can only be confirmed in areas where it does not overlap with <em>M. personata</em>; this comprises, so far as is known, only a large area of China (including Taiwan). Where it does or might overlap, there are too few properly identified records in the area of sympatry to indicate relative abundance of the two species (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2006). ""Though widely hunted, this resilient species is probably still widespread and relatively&#160;common in many parts of South China"" (Lau <em>et al</em>&#160;2010: 263). There were 238 records of this species from Taiwan between 1991 and 1993 (Pei and Wang 1995). This species is still common on Taiwan although some other carnivores on Taiwan have decreased through widespread deterioration of natural habitat and possibly also intensive rodent control programmes during the past few decades (Wang 1986, Pei and Wang 1995). ""It is a poorly understood species, despite the fact that it seems quite common"" (Wang and Fuller 2003).During a survey on ecology in the village&#160;of Taohong,&#160;northern Jiangxi Province,&#160;southeastern China (about 15 km south of the Yangtze River, at 29º48'N, 116º40'E), 27 records of this species were reported during an 11 month period by Wang and Fuller (2003). Despite the annual average harvest of 40 individuals in an area of about 16 km², which included the study area of Wang and Fuller (2003), this species still seemed rather abundant (Wang and Fuller 2003).",Stable,"Small-toothed Ferret Badger is found in China (central and south-eastern mainland, Hainan and Hong Kong),&#160;Taiwan province of China, North-east India (e.g., Naga Hills), northern Myanmar, North and Central Lao PDR, and Viet Nam (Pocock 1941, Than Zaw <em>et al</em>. 2008, Lau <em>et al</em>. 2010, Robichaud 2010, Choudhury 2013, Abramov and Rozhnov&#160;2014). Occurrence in a large area of Thailand was mapped by&#160;Storz and Wozencraft (1999), but Chutipong <em>et al</em>. (2014) could trace no record from the country. A major southward extension of known range in Viet Nam (Abramov and Rozhnov&#160;2014)&#160;suggests that elsewhere in South-eat Asia, potentially including Thailand, it could also occur many degrees of latitude further south than is conventionally assumed. It is also&#160;likely to occur in southern Bhutan, because there is a record from Buxa Tiger Reserve just south of that country (Choudhury 2013) and there are ferret badger records unidentified to species from the country (e.g., Tempa <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>In the wide region of sympatry with Large-toothed Ferret Badger&#160;<em>M. personata</em>&#160;(Myanmar, Lao PDR, Viet Nam,&#160;India, southern China, and&#160;potentially Thailand,&#160;Cambodia, and much of its mainland Chinese range), the continued rarity of use of reliable characters to identify records of ferret badgers to species (most recent potential records lack skulls or did not have the skull characters checked and were not preserved) hinder advances in understanding this species’s current distribution, status or ecology in these regions. It appears that, at least in eastern China, identification by examination of only the teeth may also be misleading (Stefen and Feiler 2004). Pelage characters are, so far as is presently known, unreliable in species-level identification (e.g., Choudhury 2013) so field records, including skin specimens lacking an associated skull, need to be considered as identifiable only to genus. Examination of the baculum in males also allows conclusive identification&#160;(Abramov and Rozhnov&#160;2014)&#160;as, presumably, would genetics.<br/><br/>Most past statements about its altitudinal range are or may be based on identifications from pelage pattern, and thus potentially include&#160;some records of&#160;Large-toothed&#160;Ferret Badger.&#160;There are specimen-validated records&#160;from up to at least&#160;1,500 m (Pocock 1941). At least in China it occurs down to&#160;sea-level.","In North-east India the species is hunted for food (A.U. Choudhury pers. comm. 2007) and this is probably true almost across its range. In Lao PDR, Viet Nam and Myanmar many non-selective methods are used, particularly intensively in Viet Nam and Lao PDR, which catch this species; there is no evidence that it is a specifically desired target. Ferret badgers are eaten and probably used medicinally (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2006). In southern China this species has historically been one of the most important fur-bearers and is subjected to heavy harvest pressure (Shou 1962, Sheng 1993, Storz and Wozencraft 1999); there are now very large numbers farmed in China and the majority of traded animals - it is common in trade in south China - are believed to be of farmed stock (Lau <em>et al</em>. 2010).",Terrestrial,"This species is likely to occur  in many protected areas across its range, specifically the northern part; the paucity of records from&#160;protected areas&#160;in the southern part, where it overlaps with <em>Melogale personata</em>&#160;(e.g., Nakai-Nam Theun NBCA, Lao PDR, Robichaud 2010; Chu Yang Sin National Park, Viet Nam, Abramov and Rozhnov 2014),&#160;perhaps signifies little other than the difficulties of confirming identification to species. In India, it is protected in Schuedule 2, Part 1. This species is listed as Near Threatened on the China Red List (Wang and Xie 2004).",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global
45209826,41627,Melogale personata,Least Concern,,2016,2015-03-03 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Large-toothed Ferret Badger is difficult to categorise because its gross external similarity to Small-toothed Ferret Badger&#160;<em>Melogale moschata</em>&#160;means that most&#160;non-specimen&#160;records generated in the last 20-30 years cannot be identified to species. Despite the paucity of reliable recent records from across its range, it is listed as Least Concern&#160;based on a number of assumptions. If any of these are shown not to be valid, its categorisation would require review. First, it was clearly formerly common in at least&#160;some parts&#160;of its range, as shown by the number of historical specimens, Second, there are no records of&#160;Small-toothed Ferret Badger<em>&#160;</em>from the parts&#160;of South-east Asia&#160;with a harsh dry season and forests&#160;which are extensively deciduous,&#160;so all modern records of the genus from such areas&#160;- which, including degraded habitats,&#160;in total cover a vast area of Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand and Myanmar - are assumed here to be Large-toothed Ferret Badger. Third, there are few records in these areas relative to many other small carnivore species readily found by modern survey methods, notably camera-trapping; this paucity&#160;seems more likely to reflect&#160;low spatial overlap between typical survey priorities (little-degraded forest)&#160;and this species's habitat use&#160;than to an all-round scarcity of this species (this&#160;is&#160;corroborated by the number of certain Large-toothed Ferret Badger records from highly degraded areas, and many more from them of the genus unidentified to species). The species is thereby inferred to be resilient to the general current levels of hunting and habitat change over most of&#160;its range. Thus it is further inferred not to be declining at anything like the rate needed for listing as Near Threatened, and its range and population size (on any plausible population density) are far in excess of values warranting listing as anything other than Least Concern.","Determining the habitat use of&#160;Large-toothed Ferret Badger is hindered by the low proportion of recent records across its&#160;range that are reliably identified to species (i.e., the externally very similar Small-toothed Ferret Badger has been clearly excluded). Looking at patterns of overall ferret badger occurrence across this species's specimen-validated range, there is a startling difference in encounter rates and inferred abundance between Viet Nam and southern China on the one hand, and Cambodia, Thailand and Myanmar on the other. In the former, ferret badgers are widely and commonly recorded (Roberton 2007, Lau <em>et al</em>. 2010, Willcox <em>et al</em>. 2014: Table SOM3). In the latter countries, records are only sporadic, and in total, relatively few in number (Than Zaw&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008, Gray&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014a, Chutipong&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). Lao PDR shows a mixed pattern: over most of the country, the genus is rarely recorded (as in Thailand, Myanmar and Cambodia)&#160;but in some parts of the country's east, it is found commonly (Robichaud 2010, Coudrat <em>et al</em>.&#160;2014, Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014b). The parts of Lao PDR where the genus has been commonly recorded are close to the Viet Namese border and are&#160;similar to Viet Nam in terms of&#160;climate (relatively benign dry&#160;season), habitat (wet evergreen forest) and associated habitat-indicator&#160;species&#160; (such as Annamite Striped Rabbit <em>Nesolagus timminsi</em>, Saola&#160;<em>Pseudoryx nghetinhensis</em>&#160;and Owston's Civet <em>Chrotogale owstoni</em>). The strong geographic basis to this pattern in Lao PDR suggests, firstly, that the widespread low detection rates in camera-trap surveys in countries such as Thailand and Myanmar do not reflect any inherent unsuitability of the methodology for finding ferret badgers,&#160;and, secondly, that many, perhaps most, of the camera-trap records in Viet Nam and southern China are of a species which does not occur in the parts of South-east Asia with a harsh dry season: based on the overall pattern of specimen-validated records, this would be&#160;Small-toothed Ferret Badger. The ferret badgers recorded in the large proportion of South-east Asia with a hot, almost arid dry season are thus hypothesised to be all Large-toothed Ferret Badgers, in keeping with all certainly identified&#160;specimens from&#160;such habitats. However, this latter species also occurs in syntopy with&#160;Small-toothed Ferret Badger in evergreen forests with a benign dry season (e.g., Robichaud 2010, Coudrat and Nanathavong 2013).&#160;Too little information is available from India and China (specifically, the precise locations&#160;of multiple records&#160;of both&#160;species relative to patterns of dry-season harshness and of relevant&#160;survey effort) to&#160;speculate on&#160;relative habitat use of the two&#160;ferret badger&#160;species&#160;in these countries.<br/><br/>Based on the above proposition, which remains to be confirmed, a number of preliminary deductions can be made about&#160;Large-toothed Ferret Badger in South-east Asia. Other than that it certainly occurs in evergreen forest, little can be said about its&#160;abundance, altitudinal use or microhabitat associations in that habitat: there are far too few&#160;evergreen forest&#160;records certainly of this species with precise habitat details to make strong inferences. However, the rarity of ferret badgers in camera-trap surveys of evergreen forest blocks long-isolated and distant from the main Annamite range (and from certain records&#160;of&#160;Small-toothed Ferret Badger), such as Khao Yai and Phu Khieo, Thailand (Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014), which have had multiple intensive surveys of the evergreen forest interior, suggests that Large-toothed Ferret Badger is not common in unbroken old-growth evergreen forest. A number of specimen-validated records of Large-toothed Ferret Badger&#160;come from highly degraded areas of&#160;South-east Asia&#160;(Van Peenen&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1971, Schank&#160;<em>et al</em>.2009, Chutipong&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014) and adjacent North-east India&#160;(Kakati&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014), together with many records of ferret badgers not identified to species (e.g., Than Zaw&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008, Chutipong&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014, Kakati <em>et al</em>. 2014). This suggests that&#160;Large-toothed Ferret Badger&#160;might be common in, perhaps even associated with, edge and degraded areas (consistent with the general assessment of habitat use by&#160;Lekagul and McNeely 1977). Indeed,&#160;Van Peenen&#160;<em>et al</em>. (1971)&#160;stated that the&#160;species was&#160;""trapped in all habitats below 550 m, including near dwellings...did not range far into rain forest, apparently preferring areas of thicker undergrowth, either&#160;grass, brush, or small trees"".&#160;As with Javan Mongoose <em>Herpestes javanicus</em>&#160;and Small Indian Civet <em>Viverricula indica</em>,&#160;Large-toothed Ferret Badger&#160;would thus be&#160;much overlooked in&#160;South-east Asia&#160;because of the focus of most wildlife survey there on old-growth, predominantly evergreen, forests (Than Zaw&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008, Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 2010, Chutipong&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Camera-trap records (assigned to this species as above)&#160;suggest that&#160;it is largely nocturnal.","General mammal hunting with non-selective methods is very high in parts of this species's range, notably Lao PDR and Viet Nam. Ferret badgers are often caught in snares and indeed various recent records identified to species come from salvage from snare lines (e.g., Abramov and Rozhnov 2014). It is quite plausible that such hunting keeps populations artificially low in these areas. The species is also&#160;probably taken for food frequently in all other parts of its range where wild mammals are widely eaten, such as&#160;North-east India (A.U. Choudhury pers. comm. 2006) and Cambodia (Schank <em>et al</em>. 2014). The relatively high number of&#160;Large-toothed Ferret Badger&#160;records from highly degraded, even largely anthropogenic, areas (Van Peenen&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1971, Than Zaw&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008, Schank&#160;<em>et al</em>.2009, Chutipong&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014, Kakati&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014)&#160;suggests that the widespread habitat conversion, fragmentation and degradation across it range is not particularly detrimental. There are too few records certainly identified to species with detailed habitat information to be sure that this species is not threatened, but there is no evidence that it is.","Large-toothed Ferret Badger's population size and trend is not well known, in large part because of the&#160;small number&#160;of recent records across its range that are reliably identified to species (i.e. the externally very similar Small-toothed Ferret Badger has been justifiably&#160;and explicitly excluded). Looking at patterns of overall ferret badger occurrence across this species's specimen-validated range (see 'Habitats and ecology'), it is impossible to assess directly the present population status of this species in areas where Small-toothed Ferret Badger is also known to occur, such as&#160;Yunnan province (China), Viet Nam and North-east India. However, there seem presently to be no known records of&#160;Small-toothed Ferret Badger from the large area of mainland South-east Asia experiencing a harsh dry season and with forest largely or wholly deciduous. This area includes most of the lowlands and lower hills of each of Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand, Myanmar and Bangladesh. In these countries, Small-toothed Ferret Badger is either unrecorded or known only from evergreen habitats (both forest and degraded areas), mostly in the highlands. (This assessment is not applicable throughout&#160;Small-toothed Ferret Badger's range;&#160;further north [and well north of any&#160;Large-toothed Ferret Badger record], in China, where Small-toothed Ferret Badger occurs in deciduous forest, the climate differs greatly from that in monsoonal South-east Asia, having for instance a much colder dry season.) Assuming that all the mainland South-east&#160;Asian records of ferret badgers in lowlands with harsh dry season to relate to Large-toothed Ferret Badger, this latter&#160;species&#160;clearly remains widespread but is typically recorded only rather rarely&#160;(Than Zaw&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008, Robichaud 2010, Gray&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014a, Chutipong&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). While this might indicate genuine rarity, a number of specimen-validated records come from highly degraded areas of South-east Asia&#160;(Van Peenen&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1971, Schank <em>et al</em>. 2009, Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014) or adjacent north-east India&#160;(Kakati&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014), raising the possibility that it might be associated with edge and degraded areas (consistent with the general assessment of habitat use by&#160;Lekagul and McNeely (1977), and is simply much overlooked by the focus of most wildlife survey in South-east Asia on little-degraded forest. General mammal hunting is&#160;generally very heavy&#160;in Lao PDR and Viet Nam and uses mostly unselective techniques: thus, Large-toothed Ferret Badger&#160;populations in these countries&#160;might well be depleted, in both degraded and forest areas&#160;(see Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 2010, Coudrat&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). Hunting levels are typically much lower&#160;in Cambodia, Thailand and Myanmar (Than Zaw <em>et al</em>. 2008, Gray&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014a, Chutipong&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). Too little information is available from India and China (specifically, the precise locations&#160;of multiple records&#160;of both&#160;species relative to patterns of dry-season harshness and of relevant&#160;survey effort) to&#160;speculate on&#160;Large-toothed Ferret Badger&#160;population&#160;status in these countries.",Unknown,"Large-toothed Ferret Badger is found in North-east India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Viet Nam, and southern Yunnan province (China) (Pocock 1941, Duckworth&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1999, Wang 2003, Roberton 2007, Dang <em>et al</em>. 2008, Islam <em>et al</em>. 2008, Than Zaw&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008, Schank&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009, Robichaud 2010, Choudhury 2013, Coudrat and Nanthavong 2013, Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014, Kakati&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). There is also&#160;an old record from western Guangdong province (China), disjunct from its known&#160;occurrence in Yunnan province (Wang 2003). It presumably occurs in Bhutan (the genus certainly does; Tempa <em>et al</em>. 2013) although no verifiable evidence was traced for this review. Historical records from 'Nepal' were accepted as of valid location by&#160;Hinton and Fry (1923) and Pocock (1941), authors&#160;who both doubted a number of other&#160;species&#160;conventionally listed for the country.&#160;Thapa (2014) by contrast called for confirmation of occurrence in Nepal. A recent photographic record unidentified to species (M. Chetri pers. comm. 2014) proves that the genus occurs in the country.&#160;<br/><br/>The range is still incompletely known, with the first records of the genus being published recently for Bangladesh and Cambodia (Islam&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008, Schank&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009). Small-toothed&#160;Ferret Badger&#160;<em>Melogale moschata</em> and <em>M. personata</em>&#160;are very similar in external morphology. Although many sources suggest they can be separated by pattern of dorsal pelage and perhaps of face markings, examination of skins with associated skulls (so species identity is known) indicates that the purported characters are population-level tendencies that are not, on present knowledge, suitable for use to identify individual animals to species (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2014, A.V. Abramov pers. comm. 2014, A.U. Choudhury pers. comm. 2014) and field records, including skin specimens lacking an associated skull or baculum, need to be considered as identifiable only to genus. Overconfident identification&#160;is an acute problem in areas like Thailand, where&#160;<em>M. personata&#160;</em>is the only species of the genus confirmed to occur, so records of the genus are routinely assumed to relate to this species without critical examination. A recent southward extension of known range,&#160;by several hundred kilometers, for&#160;<em>M. moschata</em>&#160;in Viet Nam through territory were otherwise only&#160;<em>M. personata</em>&#160;is known (Abramov and Rozhnov 2014), emphasises that&#160;identification&#160;should not be made&#160;through geographic presumption.&#160;<br/><br/>Most past statements about its altitudinal range are or may be based on identifications from pelage pattern, and thus potentially include&#160;some records of&#160;Small-toothed&#160;Ferret Badger.&#160;Large-toothed Ferret Badger&#160;has been recorded&#160;from the lowlands (e.g. 15 m a.s.l.;&#160;Schank&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009)&#160;up to at least 1,520 m (Pocock 1941); further records with specific altitude would help understand if altitudinal use varies across its range; for example, Van Peenen <em>et al</em>. (1971) wrote that it was&#160;""trapped in all habitats below 550 m"", but (by implication) not above, on Mount Son Tra, Viet Nam.","In areas where ground-dwelling mammals of this size-class are caught by unselective methods such as snares, this species is presumably eaten widely.

With no identified threats across most of its range, no near-term interventions are apparent. The conservation need related to the species is for a far better understanding of it distribution and natural history. Achieving this would be assisted by greater awareness among all those likely to encounter and report ferret badgers, particularly as road-kills or in traps (and thus where identification can be confirmed to species) of the importance of a careful identification to species (and acceptance that on present knowledge this in unlikely to be possible unless the animal is in the hand, or tested genetically) and for publication of such records.",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

It is comparatively frequently camera-trapped over substantial areas of the three major islands, from the lowlands up to 2,000 m asl. On Borneo it seems now to be largely restricted to the northeast, although historically it was recorded from other regions in Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo; see Samejima&#160;<em>et al</em>. in&#160;prep.). The reasons for the lack of recent records from large parts of Kalimantan are unknown (see Samejima&#160;<em>et al</em>. in&#160;prep.). However, any potential declines in these areas most probably occurred some decades ago, and not within the last 14 years (or three generations; Pacifici <em>et al</em>. 2013). Records from Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, indicate that this species uses disturbed forests (its occupancy being higher in more disturbed forests than in sustainably managed forests; Sollmann <em>et al</em>. in prep.) and palm oil plantations (A.J. Hearn and J. Ross pers. comm. 2014). This species evidently tolerates, perhaps even benefits from, some forms of habitat disturbance (Samejima&#160;<em>et al</em>. in prep.). Thus it is unlikely that it is experiencing major declines from the ongoing deforestation in the region. There is no evidence of its being recently targeted for food or medicine at levels&#160;sufficient&#160;to drive population declines at a pace to come near to even Near Threatened. Historical accounts, however, indicate that in the Indonesian part of Borneo, the species was frequently sought for food (see Samejima&#160;<em>et al</em>. in&#160;prep.), and hunting might have been one of the factors contributing to historical declines","Over its range,&#160;Sunda Stink-badger&#160;is found in primary and secondary forests and open grounds such as gardens adjacent to forests (Payne <em>et al</em>. 1985, Holden 2006). In Sabah it is found in both primary and disturbed forests and from the periphery out to a least four kilometres from the forest edge of oil-palm plantations. It is unknown how far it is able to venture into the plantation landscape. In Sarawak it has been recorded in a pepper garden (Samejima&#160;<em>et al</em>. in&#160;prep.). It is quite clear that it is not dependent upon primary forest. Camera-trapping at salt-licks in Sabah found it to be a common visitor (Matsubayashi <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>This species feeds on birds'&#160;eggs, carrion, insects, worms and plants (Long and Killingley 1983, Neal and Cheeseman 1996, Payne&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;1985). Litter size is usually two to three (Wood 1865). It is nocturnal, sheltering in underground burrows during the day (Hwang and Larivière 2003).<br/><br/>It is currently unknown why the species has such a patchy distribution, especially on Borneo. The species' pattern of occurrence might be linked to earthworm density, soil characters, level of (perhaps mostly past) hunting and/or other factors.","Habitat loss is unlikely to be a significant threat to&#160;Sunda Stink-badger, and at least in parts of its range the widespread degradation and fragmentation of forest might be benefiting it, as might conversion of old-growth forest to some other uses. The threat posed by hunting is difficult to assess. It might, perhaps, have led to past declines and local extirpations, but the lack of a large commercial demand for it today and its persistence in many areas close to people suggests that hunting is not presently a threat.","This species occurs in a wide range of vegetation types, including - at least in Sabah, Malaysia - very disturbed areas and plantations. So the population is likely to be relatively unaffected by the large-scale forest conversion in its range. It is currently unknown why this species was reported as common in various parts of Kalimantan in the early 20th century, yet current records from these areas are lacking. For example, in the 1930s, this species was considered “to have a very wide distribution range, including all wet and dry forests of the area discussed here [southern and&#160;southeastern &#160;Borneo]. The density however is low. In eastern Borneo its occurrence was reported&#160;only&#160;from the area north of Samarinda, and in southern Borneo from only nine locations, which were dispersed and far from each other” (Nederlandsch-Indische Vereeniging tot Natuurbescherming 1939). Its distribution seems to be patchy (Payne <em>et al</em>. 1985). It is conceivable that local extinctions have occurred, perhaps&#160;through hunting. The overall population of the species is plausibly rather stable, given its high adaptability to changing habitats, at least over the time frame of three generations.",Stable,"Sunda Stink-badger is found on Java, Kalimantan (Borneo), Sumatra and the Natuna Islands in Indonesia, and in Sabah and Sarawak in Bornean Malaysia. So far there are no confirmed records from Brunei, but parts of the country are predicted to contain habitat&#160;suitable&#160;for the species (Samejima&#160;<em>et al</em>. in&#160;prep.). On Borneo it is among the most frequently recorded carnivore species in most camera-trapping studies in the Malaysian State of Sabah (Borneo Carnivore Symposium; Samejima&#160;<em>et al</em>. in&#160;prep.). It is found from the lowlands in central and eastern Sabah (e.g. Kinabatangan) up to the highlands in western Sabah (e.g. Crocker Range National Park, A. J. Hearn and J. Ross pers. comm. 2014). In Sarawak nearly all the rather few records are from the northeastern part (Limbang and North Miri division); records south of Miri division are very few, and local people often seem unfamiliar with the species (Giman and Jukie 2012, Samejima&#160;<em>et al</em>. in&#160;prep.). But in 2012, two animals were killed in the Serian district, southwest Sarawak (Samejima&#160;<em>et al</em>. in&#160;prep.). In Kalimantan this species seems to have been recorded&#160;recently&#160;only in north and east Kalimantan (e.g., Rustam and Giordano 2014), but it was also at least locally common in south, central and west Kalimantan in the beginning of the 20th century (e.g., Lyon 1911). In west Kalimantan a specimen was collected at the Melawi river near Sintang (Medway 1977) and the recently interviewed local people from this area were familiar with this species (Samejima&#160;<em>et al</em>. in&#160;prep.).&#160;In Java all known recent records are from west Java, but van Balen (1914) recorded it from the Dieng Plateau in central Java and there are further records from Mt Ardjuna and the Tenger Mountains in east Java (Horsfield 1824, Hassan 1892). In west Java it seems to be common in the remaining forests, with recent records from various sites including Gunung Gede Pangrango National Park, Gunung Halimun Salak NP, Gunung Ciremai NP and Gunung Malabar Protected Forest (A.

However, clearly identifiable threats are operating, and known to be resulting in localised declines, and with the availability of additional information the species may warrant listing in a higher category of threat.","<p>This species lives in a wide variety of habitat types from the dense rain forests of equatorial Africa (Bahaa-el-din <em>et al.</em> 2013, Greengrass 2013) to the miombo and mopane woodland of Eastern Africa (Bird and Mateke 2013, Fischer <em>et al.</em> 2013, White 2013) or the arid deserts on the outskirts of the Sahara and Namib. It also occurs in sand and clay deserts of Middle Asia (Heptner <em>et al</em>. 1967, Gorbunov 1995). Honey Badgers are essentially nocturnal, but may be active during the day in areas where there is little human disturbance, and during seasons when day temperatures are cooler (Begg <em>et al</em>. submitted). They are opportunistic, generalist carnivores, and feed on a range of prey items varying in size from small insect larvae to the young of ungulates (Begg <em>et al.</em> 2003a).&#160;Although they are primarily hunters of their own food, they may pirate food from other carnivores and will also scavenge from the kills of larger animals (Begg <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013).&#160;All mammalian carnivores smaller than Honey Badgers are prey items, as are the young of medium-sized carnivores (Begg&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;in press). Large carnivores such as Lion (<em>Panthera leo</em>) and Leopard (<em>Panthera pardus</em>) prey on Honey Badger adults and cubs, while cubs are also killed by Black-backed Jackals (<em>Canis mesomelas</em>)<em>.</em>&#160;Honey Badgers are primarily solitary, with a non-territorial polygynous or promiscuous mating system&#160;(Begg&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005b). Males&#160;may range over areas as large&#160;as 500 km², and&#160;scent-marking plays an important role in communication (Begg <em>et al.</em> 2003b).&#160;Small litter size (generally one cub) and a long birth interval&#160;(Begg&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005a), coupled with large home-range size, explains why this species generally presents low densities.</p>","Honey Badgers&#160;are used as bushmeat and in traditional medicine, but mostly they are&#160;directly persecuted (through the use of, for example, steel-jawed traps and poisons) by apiculturists and small livestock farmers throughout their range. They are also indirectly killed by non-selective control programmes targeting other species, such as jackals (<em>Canis</em> spp.) and Caracal (<em>Caracal caracal</em>; Begg <em>et al.</em> 2013).  There is evidence to suggest they have gone locally extinct in many areas through poisoning (C. Begg and K. Begg pers. obs. 2006). Although there is little apiculture in areas of North Africa where the species occurs (except near the Lower Draa area, in Morocco), they are persecuted there (trapping, poisoning; K. de Smet and F. Cuzin pers. comm. 2007).","Honey Badgers&#160;are considered rare or to exist at low densities across most of their range (Begg <em>et al</em>.&#160;2013). Densities based on night counts have been estimated at 0.1 individual/km² in the Serengeti N. P., Tanzania (Waser 1980) and 0.03 adult/km² in the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park, South Africa (Begg 2001).",Decreasing,"The Honey Badger has an extensive range which extends through most of sub-Saharan Africa from the Western Cape, South Africa, to southern Morocco and south-western Algeria, and outside Africa through Arabia, Iran and western Asia to Middle Asia (Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan), the Indian peninsula and Nepal. There are no collection records from Afghanistan (Hassinger 1973, Habibi 2004), but the species has been recorded on the Turkmenistan side of the cross-border Tedzhen, Murghab and Amu Darya river valleys (Sapozhenkov <em>et al.</em> 1973). Therefore it could well be present in northern Afghanistan, as already suggested by Bobrinskii <em>et al.</em> (1944). There are no records from Egypt (Basuony <em>et al.</em> 2010) or Syria (Masseti 2009). However, it is possible that Honey Badger is marginally present in the latter country, especially because the species occurs in neighbouring Jordan (Amr 2000) and Israel (Werner 2012). Historically, it is thought to be absent from the driest centre of the Sahara Desert, the Mediterranean coast as far as the Nile Valley, and the central (Free State province) part of South Africa. Although widespread in much of&#160;India, its&#160;distribution&#160;in the southern&#160;states&#160;is highly discontinuous (e.g., Gubbi <em>et al</em>. 2014) and it barely penetrates the North-east (Choudhury 2013). The few records from Iran are widely&#160;spread, although Joolaee <em>et al</em>. (2012)&#160;traced none from the country's north-west or its east.

The species's&#160;range also constitutes an area where recent climate change and predicted future change in climate could substantially reduce the habitat. These declines&#160;over the past three generations&#160;are projected to continue, through the&#160;same factors, for the next three.","Altai Weasel occurs&#160;only outside closed forest habitats, typically in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, dry&#160;steppes and&#160;plains, and river valleys with reeds and bushes&#160;(e.g., Heptner <em>et al</em>. 1967,&#160;Hornskov and Foggin 2007,&#160;Bischof&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2014,&#160;Ghimirey and Acharya 2014). It is also found in sparse forest vegetation and predominantly open landscape (Kruska 1990). It often occurs close to human settlements and agriculture (e.g,.&#160;Ghimirey and Acharya 2014). It is exclusively carnivorous, preying mainly upon&#160;pikas <em>Ochotona</em>, various rodents&#160;(voles, mice, hamsters), small birds, lizards, and insects (Pocock 1941). It is particularly dependent upon pikas across much of its range (Smith and Foggin 1999). The gestation period is 38-40 days, without delayed implantation. The litter size is 2-6, sometimes (in captivity)&#160;up to 13 (Sludsky <em>et al</em>. 1982). It is ground-dwelling, but climbing readily on rock-piles and fallen wood (e.g., Hornskov and Foggin 2007,&#160;Ghimirey and Acharya 2014). Despite&#160;some&#160;statements to the contrary, it is evidently&#160;diurnal across much or all of its range&#160;(e.g., Tibetan plateau, Hornskov and Foggin 2007; northern Pakistan,&#160;Bischof <em>et al</em>.&#160;2014; Nepal,&#160;Ghimirey and Acharya 2014).","This species is threatened by ongoing habitat conversion across&#160;most of its range. These effects seem to be worsening with climate change. Most seriously there are agriculturally-driven pika <em>Ochotona</em>-control campaigns across much of this&#160;species's range, which have eradicated the weasel's main food from large areas (Hornskov and Foggin 2007). It is affected by 'mountain meadow' degradation, of the habitats to which it is particularly adapted: on the Tibetan plateau,&#160;Hornskov and Foggin (2007) observed that&#160;""in most places the natural vegetation cover has been partially to seriously overgrazed by domestic bovids (yak and yak/cow hybrids) and sheep: only a few areas remain with little or no human/livestock impact on the grassland vegetation"". This species does not tolerate a high degree of alteration and it avoids agricultural lands. In Nepal it is killed for use as a medicinal charm but given its ongoing common occurrence close to human settlements, this does not seem to be at levels sufficient to threaten it (Ghimirey and Acharya 2014).

Although the population is likely to be reducing in proportion to deforestation, no major threats to the species within remaining habitat are known or suspected.","Malay Weasel range coincides with the distribution of Sundaic evergreen broad-leafed forest: most records come from this habitat. It is possible that it strictly avoids more seasonal areas: there are no records from southeast Borneo (most of&#160;which has a distinct dry season), although this might simply be an artefact of limited survey there (Duckworth&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006). Many records come from lightly to heavily encroached areas.

It is probably similar to other weasels in other aspects: it is likely to be solitary, mostly ground-dwelling and so potentially exposed to generalised snaring and other forms of trapping. However, the distribution of recent records in deforested areas, even urban sites, indicates a high tolerance to human activities (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 2006).","Currently no major threats to this species have been traced. It is eaten in parts of Sarawak, and presumably elsewhere in its range, and there is some evidence of medicinal use, but no evidence that these activities are sufficient to constitute threats, even locally (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 2006). However, deforestation has been widespread in recent decades across it range, particularly at lower altitudes, for conversion to plantations and other non-forest habitats that almost certainly support lower (or zero) Malay Weasel densities than do native forest. This allows a fairly confident assessment that overall its global population will be declining over time. Sufficient habitat survives and is legally assigned to remain forested that deforestation is not a threat to the species' survival or maintenance of its natural range.","Malay Weasel has not been studied in the wild. It appears to be widespread but difficult to see and camera-trap, and probably at low density (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 2006, Ross <em>et al</em>. 2013).

There are also scattered records from Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland and north-west Italy (Delibes 1999).

Protection efforts depend on significant Range State expenditure and effort, and if these were to decline rampant poaching could seriously threaten numbers (well in excess of 30% over three generations). Declining state budgets for conservation in real terms, declining capacity in some areas and increasing arrests of Southeast Asians for rhino crimes in African Range States are all of concern. Estimated White Rhino numbers have declined 15% from 2012–17 in response to increased poaching. This decline has largely been because of a major decline in the largest subpopulation in Greater Kruger due to poaching. While absolute numbers poached in this park continue to decline, so have White Rhino numbers with the result that in relative terms poaching has remained at unsustainable levels. Fortunately, White Rhino numbers have been increasing in many other populations and since White Rhino poaching peaked in 2014 it has declined in response to considerably increased law enforcement and protection efforts. Reported poaching in the major Range State South Africa is also down in 2019. While the White Rhino is close to having less than 10,000 mature individuals, it would not meet any other of the additional criteria under C1 or C2.<br/><br/><strong>In summary the rationale for treating White Rhino as Near Threatened and not Least Concern is that in the&#160;</strong><strong>numbers could decline significantly in the&#160;</strong><strong>absence of, or significant reduction of current conservation measures.&#160;</strong><strong>Despite White Rhino point estimates declining by an estimated 15% from 2012–17, numbers are&#160;</strong><strong>nowhere near reaching critical thresholds under criteria A2 or A4 (see Figures 4 and 5 and Tables 4 and 5 in the attached S</strong><strong>upplementary Information document). Recorded White Rhino poaching has been declining since 2014.</strong></p>",The species is found in grassland in bushveld savanna habitats. It is a grazer.,"<p>The main threat to the population is illegal hunting (poaching) to supply the illegal international rhino horn trade. It is estimated that currently around 95% of rhino horn sourced in Africa for end user illegal markets in SE Asia are from this source (Emslie <em>et al</em>. 2019). Rhino horn has traditionally had two main uses: use in Chinese medicine, and ornamental use. Recently rhino horn has become a highly prized material for making carved expensive high-status items such bowls and bangles. In the past it was also used to produce ornately carved handles for ceremonial daggers (jambiyas) worn in Yemen and some Middle East countries. Historically rhino horn was also used in traditional Chinese medicine (as a fever reducer). However, most recently it appears to be shavings from carvings that are illegally sold to the medicinal market at lower prices than worked items. Until recently, at the continental species level, poaching of White Rhinos has not had a serious impact on overall numbers of White Rhinos in Africa, with poaching losses in parts of the range being surpassed by encouraging growth rates in others. However following declines in the largest subpopulation (Greater Kruger) continental numbers declined by an estimated 15% from 2012 to 2015. While poaching levels increased dramatically from 2007 to 2014, numbers of White Rhinos reported poached have declined in each of the four years every year since, and half year reported poaching in 2019 in the major Range State, South Africa indicates this trend is possibly continuing. See attached Supplementary Material for graphs of reported poaching numbers by year.<br/><br/>The significantly increased poaching since 2007 has greatly increased protection costs and risks to investment and staff. This has resulted in declining live sale prices and reduced incentives. Some private owners in South Africa have got rid of their rhino. If this worrying trend continues this threatens to possibly reverse the expansion of range and has the potential to also significantly reduce conservation budgets (due to declining live sales at lower prices). However, so far there appears to be a consolidation of White Rhino into larger subpopulations. For more information on threats see the joint IUCN/TRAFFIC rhino report for CITES CoP18 (Emslie <em>et al</em>. (2019) <a href=""http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/pdf_files/156/1560170144.pdf"">http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/pdf_files/156/1560170144.pdf</a>).<br/><br/>Poaching and civil wars in both Democratic Republic of the Congo and neighbouring South Sudan had a devastating impact on Northern White Rhino. Whilst poaching pressure initially increased during civil unrest and war in the late 1990s, good reproduction enabled the population to remain relatively stable. However, since 2003, poaching escalated and the population declined rapidly with 11 carcasses found in a three-month period between March and May 2004. Confirmed numbers of Northern White Rhino fell from 30 individuals in April 2003 to just four in August 2005. No live rhino have been seen since 2006 or signs of live rhino (spoor or dung) reported since 2007 despite intensive systematic foot surveys. It is believed that the Northern White Rhino has probably gone extinct in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Rumours persist of possible survivors in war-torn South Sudan, but as yet there has been no conclusive evidence of this being the case.&#160;</p>","<p>As of 31 December 2017, there were an estimated 18,064 White Rhino in the wild. The majority (99.3% ) of White Rhino occur in just five countries (South Africa, Namibia, Kenya, Botswana and Zimbabwe (Emslie<em> et al</em>. 2019 <a href=""http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/pdf_files/156/1560170144.pdf"">http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/pdf_files/156/1560170144.pdf</a>). As of Dec 2008 there were an estimated 750 in captivity worldwide.<br/><br/>Once widespread in the bushveld areas of southern Africa south of the Zambezi River, the Southern White Rhino was on the brink of extinction by the end of the 19th century having been reduced to just one small population of approximately 20–50 animals in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. However, by the end of 2012, after years of protection and many translocations, the subspecies had grown to an estimated 21,316 wild animals. Following poaching increases estimated numbers had declined about 15% to 18,064 by the end of 2017 with bootstrapped 90% confidence levels of 17,212 to 18,915. South Africa remains the stronghold for this subspecies (~86.5%) conserving an estimated 18,933 individuals by the end of&#160;2012. Smaller reintroduced subpopulations occur within former Range States in Botswana, Namibia, Eswatini, and Zimbabwe; subpopulations of free-ranging Southern White Rhino have also been established outside their historical range in Kenya, Zambia (Emslie and Brooks 1999) and more recently Uganda although Uganda is a former <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Ceratotherium simum cottoni</span>&#160;Range State and an ~3,500 year old White Rhino subfossil indicates at one stage Kenya was also once a White Rhino Range State. Numbers of White Rhino under private ownership continue to increase.<br/><br/>In the only confirmed surviving wild subpopulation in Garamba National Park, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Northern White Rhino (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">C. s. cottoni</span>) numbers declined rapidly from 30 in April 2003 due to an upsurge in poaching, and surveys in 2006 confirmed the presence of only four rhinos (Emslie <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2006). Numbers are believed to have stood at around 2,360 in 1960 (Emslie and Brooks 1999). However based largely on extensive and systematic foot surveys which failed to sight live rhino and find any signs (spoor and dung) this subpopulation is now considered probably extinct. Reports of a few possible Northern White Rhino surviving in a remote part of Southern Sudan have yet to be confirmed. The last four potential breeding Northern White Rhino in captivity were moved to a private conservancy in Kenya in the hope that a move to more wild conditions would&#160;stimulate them to breed. While the two females came into oestrus and mated no calves have been born and the two males have subsequently died. Assisted reproductive methods are being developed in the hope of being able to conserve some Northern White Rhino genes.&#160;</p>",Decreasing,"<p>Two subspecies of White Rhino are currently recognized, the Northern (NWR) and the Southern (SWR), each having a strikingly discontinuous range in recent times. However there is fossil evidence the species used to have a continuous distribution and there is genetic evidence of probable post divergence secondary contact during the last interglacial (14,000 to 26,000 years ago) facilitated by savanna grassland expansion at that time (Moodley <em>et al.</em> 2018).<br/><br/>The Northern White Rhino (NWR) used to range over parts of northwestern Uganda, southern Chad, southwestern South Sudan, the eastern part of Central African Republic, and northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (Sydney 1965). The previous only confirmed population in Garamba National Park in northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo is now considered probably extinct. Despite systematic ground surveys over probable range and additional foot patrols and aerial reconnaissance no live rhinos have been seen since 2006 and no fresh sign since 2007. There continue to be unconfirmed reports/rumours of rhino in southern Sudan but these have not been reliably confirmed and wildlife poaching in this area has reportedly increased and so it is unlikely any still survive. The last four potential breeding Northern White Rhino in captivity in Dvur Kralove Zoo in the Czech Republic were translocated to a private conservancy in Kenya in the hope this would stimulate their breeding but despite mating no offspring were produced before the two old males died, and it appears the females will not breed despite attempts at inter-crossing. These two non-breeding females form the only current confirmed living NWR but cannot be included in the Red List assessments as they haven't bred since reintroduction back into the wild.&#160;Any future conservation of adaptive NWR genes now is dependent of successfully developing new assisted reproduction techniques.&#160;Researchers have collected oocytes from the two surviving NWR females and have sperm cells from five NWR that have all since died. The later could be used in IVF efforts. Advanced cellular techniques offer the potential to boost founder genetic diversity as there are stored cells and tissues from a greater number of NWR than for natural gametes. If Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can be used to produce primordial germ cells, then there is a possibility to create oocytes and sperm from other dead NWR. If IVF can be successfully developed with embryos implanted in surrogate SWR mothers, then it should be possible to produce NWR calves. The latter when grown up could be used to create a self-sustaining population of rhinos. IVF inter-crossing could also be attempted. In time if such assisted reproductive methods can be successfully developed then once numbers have built up sufficiently some of these animals could be reintroduced back into secure areas of former range or close to former range in East Africa. There can be no guarantee's such techniques will be successful but at this stage progress has been made in creating embryos in the lab.<br/><br/>The Southern White Rhino was on the brink of extinction by the end of the 19<sup>th</sup>&#160;century (<em>c.</em>&#160;1895) having been reduced to just one small population of approximately 20–50 animals in KwaZulu-Natal, after settlers had over-hunted them for sport and to clear land for agriculture throughout almost all of their historical range&#160;(Emslie <em>et al.</em> 2009). However, by the end of 2015, after years of protection and many translocations (Emslie and Brooks 1999), the subspecies had grown to ~20,000 animals in the wild and semi-wild (Emslie <em>et al.</em> 2019) in over 400 subpopulations. The Southern White Rhino is now the most numerous of the rhino taxa, with South Africa remaining the stronghold for this subspecies despite increased poaching.<br/><br/>Southern White Rhino numbers increased rapidly from 1992-2010, averaging +7.1%/year. However population growth then slowed as poaching increased, with numbers declining from 2012 onwards.&#160;The ~15% decline in estimated continental White Rhino numbers from 2012–2017 can largely be accounted for by a drop in estimated numbers in the largest population, in South Africa’s Kruger National Park (KNP), which has been severely affected by poaching since 2007. Despite absolute numbers of White Rhinos being reported poached declining in Kruger over the last four years, so has the number of White Rhino numbers in the park. To a much lesser extent this population (and some others) were also negatively affected by a recent very bad drought. The result is that as a % of the population, poaching in Kruger NP has remained at unsustainably high levels. This is especially the case when one considers evidence that indicates some poached carcasses in this and other very large Parks are not detected (Ferreira <em>et al.</em> 2018; N. Anderson and R. du Toit pers. comm.).&#160;Fortunately some of the Kruger Park decline has been partially cancelled out by increases elsewhere - especially on private land in South Africa as well as in some other Range States. Numbers&#160;on privately-owned wild populations in South Africa that provided estimates for both 2017 and 2018 increased by +6.9% while numbers on the largest semi-wild CBO population also increased by +6.8% over the year. Numbers of White Rhino also increased by 3.1% from 2017–18 in the rest of Africa outside of South Africa (2,442 to 2,517) with just over half of this likely to have been from exports of live animals from South Africa in 2018. 90% Confidence Levels around continental Southern White Rhino estimates (derived by bootstrapping using calculated or estimated precision around estimates) for end 2017 were estimated at 17,212–18,915 (Emslie <em>et al.</em> 2019).&#160;</p>    <p>Sizeable populations occur in the greater Kruger National Park (which incorporates additional private and state reserves) and Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park (the original source of all surviving Southern White Rhino alive today), but also occur in numerous state protected areas and private reserves (some of which are also well protected) throughout the country. Live sales, limited sport hunting and ecotourism have historically provided incentives which has resulted in a significant expansion of range and numbers on private land - especially in the major Range State South Africa. There are now more White Rhino on private land in South Africa than there are rhino in the whole of the rest of Africa. However increased poaching since 2007, resultant significantly increased security costs and reduced and limited economic incentives for their conservation have resulted in significantly reduced demand for White Rhino. Live sale prices of surplus White Rhino have declined significantly (Emslie <em>et al.</em> 2019) and an increasing number of owners seeking to get rid of their rhino. If it expands to larger populations this trend may threaten the continued expansion of range, and has the potential to also significantly reduce conservation budgets (due to declining live sales). Lower removal rates from established populations will negatively affect metapopulation growth rates in future as well as reduce budgets for conservation. There are smaller reintroduced subpopulations within the historical range of the species in Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe and Eswatini (formerly Swaziland). The&#160;small number that survived in Mozambique were poached out, but some animals have crossed the border into Mozambique from Kruger Park in South Africa. While they used to have a very limited lifespan if not chased back across the border into South Africa small numbers now survive in some areas due to improved protection.&#160;Populations of Southern White Rhino have also been introduced outside of the known former range of the subspecies to Kenya, Uganda and to Zambia (Emslie and Brooks 1999, Emslie <em>et al</em>. 2007). Uganda was previously a Northern White Rhino range state and so the species has been reintroduced to this country. Moodley <em>et al</em>.'s (2018) work suggests that some form of White Rhino could have been native to Zambia and Kenya prior to recent historical times.<br/><br/>An estimated four White Rhino still live in the wild two other African countries, but these are remnants of animals introduced well outside the historical range of the species.<br/><br/>While Kenya has not been a White Rhino range state in the last two hundred years; evidence from fossils and cave paintings in Kenya and northern Tanzania suggests that the White Rhino, presumably similar to the northern race (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Ceratotherium simum cottoni</span>), was widespread and a part of the East African savanna fauna until 3,000 years ago or less (M. Leakey pers. comm.), when it was probably displaced by pastoralists who could easily kill such tame animals (Brett 1993). This is based on the White Rhino subfossil documented by Maeve Leakey from 3,000 year from Rift Valley (Lake Nakuru area). Thus at one stage Kenya was once a White Rhino range state (subspecies unknown) and hence the White Rhino as a species but not <em>C. s. simum</em> as a subspecies has probably been reintroduced to Kenya (with the latter being an introduction of a probable out of range subspecies). A recent report of a White Rhino hunting trophy from Kenya in an Austrian Museum still has to be confirmed but merits further investigation.<br/><br/><strong>Note:</strong> At the request of certain members and countries, the IUCN SSC African Rhino Specialist Group (AfRSG) has a policy of not releasing detailed information (including maps) showing the whereabouts and names of all rhino subpopulations for security reasons. For this reason, only whole countries of occurrence are indicated on the range maps produced by the AfRSG. However, numbers by species and subspecies are routinely summarised at a continental level. Estimated numbers by country as of the end of 2017 (Emslie <em>et al</em>. (2019) <a href=""http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/pdf_files/156/1560170144.pdf"">http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/pdf_files/156/1560170144.pdf</a>) were South Africa 15,625, Namibia 975, Kenya 513 (with 510 <em>C. s. simum</em> and 3 <em>C. s. cottoni</em>), Botswana 452, Zimbabwe 367, Eswatini 66, Mozambique 29, Uganda 22, Zambia 14. There were an additional one and three animals respectively out of range in Cote d'Ivoire and Senegal but these are not historical Range States for the species. Bootstrapped estimates of 90% confidence levels around the total point estimate for 2017 were 17,212 to 18,915. Due to incomplete information from three South African provinces at the time of writing it is not possible to provide an updated end 2018 continental estimate. Indications are that South African 2018 numbers are likely to be similar or slightly lower than 2017. End 2018 estimates for other countries were Namibia 1,082, Kenya 664 (622 SWR, 2 NWR), Botswana 401, Zimbabwe 357, Eswatini 79, Mozambique 28, Uganda 25 and Zambia 11. The continued existence of four WR out of range in West Africa is not confirmed.</p>","It has been estimated that around 95% of horn sourced in Africa for illegal markets in Asia in 2016 and 2017 came from poached animals in the wild (Emslie <em>et al.</em> 2019). In some cases horn for illegal markets has been stolen or illegally sold from horn stockpiles/private trophies/museum exhibits. “Pseudo-hunting” where sport hunting has been undertaken by individuals from non-traditional hunting countries with the aim of illegally providing horn to illegal markets has also been responsible for some of the illegal horn getting onto end-user markets although this has reduced considerably since South Africa implemented a number of measures in 2012. At one stage as much as 18% of the horn sourced for illegal markets came from this source (Emslie <em>et al.</em> 2012) but most recent estimates suggest this source only contributes 0.7% (Emslie <em>et al. </em>2019). Live specimens for translocation are invariably taken from natural habitat, but this forms part of routine biological management of the species to meet genetic and demographic goals. This is because many established wild subpopulations require regular removals to prevent “overstocking” and maintain rapid population growth rates. Maintaining rapid underlying population growth rates also minimises loss of genetic diversity over time due to genetic drift. Given the high price of sport-hunting, and clamp down on pseudo-hunting by South Africa in 2012, only about 75 White Rhino are currently sport hunted per year in Africa. This is less than 0.5% of the population annually. For more information see Emslie <em>et al</em>. (2019) <a href=""http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/pdf_files/156/1560170144.pdf"">http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/pdf_files/156/1560170144.pdf</a>.",Terrestrial,"<p>Effective field protection of rhino subpopulations has been critical. Many remaining rhino are now concentrated in fenced sanctuaries, conservancies, rhino conservation areas and intensive protection zones where law enforcement effort can be concentrated at effective levels. Monitoring has also provided information to guide biological management decision-making aimed at managing rhino subpopulations for rapid population growth. This has resulted in surplus animals being translocated to set up new subpopulations both within and outside the species’ former ranger. However, increasing black market prices for rhino horn, increased poaching of rhino and involvement of criminal syndicates in recent years pose a significant threat to rhino subpopulations. Strategically, White Rhinos are now managed by a range of different stakeholders (private sector and state) in a number of countries increasing their long-term security. In Southern Africa live sale of White Rhinos on auction (and limited sport hunting of surplus males) has also created incentives for private sector conservation and generated much needed funds which can help pay the high cost of successfully monitoring, protecting and managing rhino. Almost half of the White Rhino across Africa are now managed by the private sector throughout Africa with the majority in South Africa (Emslie <em>et al</em>. 2019). However, as discussed above, incentives are declining while protection costs and risks have increased resulting in some owners getting rid of their rhino.<br/><br/>By 1977, all African rhino species were listed on CITES Appendix I, and all international commercial trade in rhinos and their products was prohibited. However, following a continued increase in numbers, the South African population of Southern White Rhino was downlisted in 1994 to Appendix II, but only for trade in live animals to “approved and acceptable destinations” and for the (continued) export of hunting trophies. Numbers have almost trebled since then. In 2004, Eswatini's (formerly Swaziland) Southern White Rhino were also downlisted to CITES Appendix II, but only for live export and for limited export of hunting trophies according to specified annual quotas. To help reduce illegal trade, and complement CITES international trade bans, domestic anti-trade measures and legislation were implemented in the 1990s by a number of the major consumer states and law enforcement effort has been stepped up in many consumer countries. Demand reduction initiatives are also underway in key implicated states such as Viet Nam.<br/><br/>In addition to local, national, international and continental initiatives, there are a number of regional African rhino conservation initiatives: the South African Development Community (SADC) Rhino Management Group , a recently revitalised East African Rhino Management Group and the Southern African Rhino and Elephant Security Group. IUCN SSC's African Rhino Specialist Group is the continental coordinating body for rhino conservation in Africa. In addition to National Rhino Plans there is a Continental African Rhino Range States Conservation Plan.

The species is generally widespread. Black-backed Jackals are relatively unspecialized canids and well suited for an opportunistic lifestyle in a wide variety of habitats. The species is persecuted for its role as livestock killers and as rabies vectors. However, population control efforts appear largely ineffective and probably only succeed in producing a temporary reduction in local numbers.","Black-backed Jackals are found in a wide variety of habitats including arid coastal desert (Dreyer and Nel 1990), montane grassland (Rowe-Rowe 1982), open savanna (Wyman 1967, Kingdon 1977, Lamprecht 1978, Moehlman 1983, Fuller <em>et al.</em> 1989, Estes 1991), woodland savanna mosaics (Smithers 1971, Loveridge and Macdonald 2002) and farmland. In general, Black-backed Jackals show a preference for open habitats tending to avoid dense vegetation (Pienaar 1969). In KwaZulu-Natal, they are recorded from sea level to more than 3,000 m asl. in the Drakensberg, and in localities receiving more than 2,000 mm of rainfall (Rowe-Rowe 1982, 1992); they have been recorded from the alpine zone of Mt Kenya at 3,660 m (Young and Evans 1993). Where more than one jackal species occur in sympatry the habitat is partitioned. The trend is for Black-backed Jackals to use preferentially either the open grassland (when sympatric with Side-striped Jackal; Loveridge 1999) or wooded savanna (when sympatric with Golden and Side-striped Jackals; Fuller <em>et al</em>. 1989). In western Zimbabwe, habitat partitioning was mediated by aggressive encounters in which Black-backed Jackals displaced Side-striped Jackals from grassland habitats (Loveridge 1999).","There are no major threats to the species. Black-backed Jackals are persecuted for their role as livestock killers and as rabies vectors (Black-based Jackals are very susceptible to rabies, and are responsible for transmission of the disease to domestic stock). However, population control efforts appear largely ineffective and probably only succeed in producing a temporary reduction in local numbers. In any case, rabies in jackals may be better controlled through oral vaccination techniques, and through immunization of domestic dogs, than by culling (Loveridge and Macdonald 2001).","Black-backed Jackals are generally widespread and, in Namibia and South Africa, they are common in protected areas where suitable habitat occurs. They occur in many livestock producing areas, where they are considered vermin, but despite strenuous control measures in many farming areas of southern Africa remain relatively abundant.<br/><br/>Recorded densities include&#160;one jackal/2.5–2.9 km² in&#160;the Drakensberg Mountains of South Africa (Rowe-Rowe 1982), 0.5 /&#160;km² in Serengeti N. P. (Waser 1980), and&#160;53.9–79.1 per 100 km² in Hwange N. P. in Zimbabwe (increasing&#160;to 68.3–97.1 per 100 km²&#160;during the breeding season) (Loveridge and Nel 2013). Jackal densities may be higher in areas of super-abundant resources, as in the immediate vicinity of the seal colony in the Cape Cross Seal Reserve in Namibia.",Stable,"The Black-backed Jackal is endemic to Africa. This species has a disjunct distribution range, and is found in two separate populations, one in East Africa and the Horn, and the other in southern Africa. Ansell (1960) notes that this species is entirely absent from Zambia and it is absent through much of central and equatorial Africa. The disjunct distribution of this species is similar to that of other endemic African species adapted to dry conditions (e.g., Aardwolf <em>Proteles cristatus</em> and Bat-eared Fox <em>Otocyon megalotis</em>). The two Black-backed Jackal ranges are separated by as much as 1,000 km and their discontinuous distribution suggests that regions of dry Acacia bush and savanna, the preferred habitat of this species, once connected south-west Africa and the Horn of Africa.<br/><br/>Fossils of Black-backed Jackals have been found in deposits in South Africa dating to at least two million years ago (Hendey 1974), but fossil remains have never been found north of Ethiopia suggesting that they have always been restricted to sub-Saharan Africa.","There is no significant trade in jackal products, although body parts are used in traditional African medicine and clothing.",Terrestrial,"The species is not included in the CITES Appendices and has no legal protection outside protected areas.

In the last decade, however, the emphasis has generally shifted to the role that the animal plays as a vector of rabies, and as a problem animal. The study of Loveridge (1999), for example, directed efforts towards better understanding their role in disease transmission and livestock predation, while ecological, behavioural and other data are gathered concurrently.

Declines are driven by hunting for meat and trade in horns combined with extensive habitat loss and degradation in mainland southeast Asia and Java, Sabah, and Kalimantan. The global population is estimated at approximately 8,000 individuals of which about 60% occur in the deciduous dipterocarp forests of eastern Cambodia. Declines in the Indochinese population are likely to approach the threshold (80% ongoing decline) for listing as Critically Endangered. However, a global categorization as Critically Endangered under A2 (past decline) this would have required a 1995 (three generations ago) global population of greater than 39,000 individuals. Given a substantial proportion of the population and range decline in mainland southeast Asia occurred prior to 1995 it is unlikely that sufficient high quality non-heavily hunted habitat existed in the mid 1990s to support such a substantial global population (at current densities in little-hunted parts of Cambodia, there are about two Bantengs per square kilometre – thus about 20,000 km² of similar range would have been required). As such the listing as Endangered is maintained, but the global decline rate during this period is likely to have been closer to 80% than to 50%. Somewhat reduced decline rates are expected to continue for the next 3 generations, but these are likely still to exceed a 50% loss.","<p><span lang=""EN-CA"">Wharton (1968) summarized information about Banteng habitat from throughout its range and he concluded that on the Asian mainland it avoids evergreen forest and even extensive tracts of closed canopy semi-evergreen forest, and is usually within more open dry deciduous forests; but within the more humid areas of Java and Borneo it occupies secondary forest formations resulting from logging and fires, and enters tracts of sub-humid forest on occasion. However, on mainland South-east Asia, human use of these preferred areas has increased and may have forced residual groups of surviving Banteng to retreat to relatively closed formations where consequently they now overlap more with Gaur <em>Bos gaurus</em>; although good evidence for such an assertion is lacking. On the eastern plains of Cambodia where the species remains numerous, but human use is relatively high, there is no evidence for any change in ecology. In Myanmar, Banteng is reported to prefer flat or undulating terrain with light deciduous (particularly dipterocarp indaing forest) or mixed deciduous and evergreen forest, with grassy glades which burn annually, and patches of bamboo; but it has purportedly retreated to denser hill forest in the face of advancing cultivation. (Peacock 1933, Wharton 1968, Tun Yin 1967, Prater 1971). Similarly in Thailand, Cambodia, Viet Nam, and Lao PDR, Banteng occurs&#160;(or occurred) in open mainly deciduous forest with glades, parklands, and dense forest patches; and ‘it is claimed by some that they prefer rocky, slightly hilly country, but they are certainly at home wherever the Kouprey [<em>Bos sauveli</em>] is found. Their range in Cambodia [and elsewhere in South-east Asia] suggests that Banting [sic] are more adaptable than Kouprey and perhaps less exacting in their habitat requirements’ (Wharton 1957, 1968). Recently the attachment to open, more deciduous forest types was reported in Xe Pian National Protected Area, Lao PDR (Steinmetz 2004). The documented and reported distribution of the species in Cambodia, Lao PDR and Viet Nam (based on many sources, but principally summarized in Duckworth and Hedges 1998, Duckworth&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1999 and AWCSG 2011) quite clearly corresponds in large part to the distribution of deciduous dipterocarp forest, but also includes other habitats especially mosaic habitats that include open-canopy formations and grasslands, including for example pine forests. In contrast there is a clear paucity of records of Banteng from extensive tracts of closed canopy evergreen and semi-evergreen forests, with no records from the heart of any such dense forests. The supposition that it might prefer rocky, slightly hilly country has not been borne out by recent observations. In the Eastern Plains Landscape, Cambodia, Gray (<span lang=""EN-CA"">2012)<span lang=""EN-CA"">, based on analysis of camera-trap records, considered that&#160;Banteng occurred in both very open deciduous dipterocarp forest and denser mixed deciduous forest. It was also suggested that, in <span lang=""EN-US"">the largely homogenous deciduous dipterocarp forest of the Cambodian Eastern Plains Landscape small patches of mixed deciduous forest are important for Banteng at the height of the dry and burning seasons.</span></span></p><p><span lang=""EN-CA"">In Sabah (Malaysia Borneo) Banteng inhabits tropical lowland and upland dipterocarp forest, lower montane forest, seasonal freshwater swamp forest and beach forest <span lang=""EN-CA"">(<span lang=""EN-CA"">Melletti and Burton 2014)<span lang=""EN-CA"">. It also uses open grassland, mature timber plantations (7 years), and abandoned cultivated land. Forest edges, interior openings, abandoned logging roads and river banks are important for foraging, socializing and movement <span lang=""EN-CA"">(Payne <em>et al</em>. 1985, Gardner 2015)<span lang=""EN-CA"">. Human disturbance heavily influences habitat use. In forest habitat that is mature, Banteng travels to interior grassy openings within the forest to forage or travels to the forest edge to forage during undisturbed hours (Gardner 2015).</span></span></span></p><p><span lang=""EN-CA""><span lang=""EN-CA""><span lang=""EN-CA""><span lang=""EN-CA""><span lang=""EN-CA""><span lang=""EN-CA"">In Java Banteng occurs in semi-deciduous monsoon forest with small clearings, more open grassland-monsoon forest mosaics, and ‘parkland’ formations (Halder 1976, Hommel 1987, S.

Hedges pers. comm. 2008 base on unpubl. data 1991–2002). The observed maximum elevation of Banteng in Sabah is approximately 1,330 m a.s.l. (P. Gardner pers. obs).<br/> <br/> Banteng reportedly drinks large quantities of water and prefers feeding grounds near a permanent water supply (Hoogerwerf 1970). When conditions are favourable it drinks daily, preferring standing water; but during droughts animals can survive several days without drinking (National Research Council 1983). Mineral licks are also an important feature of Banteng habitat; in coastal regions which lack mineral licks animals seem to meet their mineral requirements by occasionally drinking seawater (Halder 1976, Payne <em>et al</em>. 1985, Alikodra 1987, S. Hedges pers. obs.).<br/> <br/><span lang=""EN-CA"">Although probably a grazer by preference Banteng should perhaps be considered an intermediate feeder since it can and does consume a lot of browse and fruits depending on season and local food availability. It eats grasses, sedges, herbs, bamboo, as well as the leaves, fruits, flowers, bark, and young branches of woody shrubs and trees including palms. The young shoots of Alang-alang grass <em>Imperata cylindrica</em>&#160;are apparently a favoured food source (Hoogerwerf 1970). Lists of food plants are provided by Wharton (1957), Hoogerwerf (1970), Halder (1976), Sumardja and Kartawinata (1977), Djaja <em>et al</em>. (1982), Alikodra (1987), Prayurasiddhi and Smith (1993), and Hedges (in prep.). However, very little is known about the Banteng’s nutritional requirements, seasonal and annual variation in dietary preferences, or the composition and quality of diet. Hoogerwerf was of the opinion that Banteng was largely dependent on grasses and sedges and, with reference to Ujung Kulon in West Java, he stated that ‘there were no proofs that browse formed a substantial part of the diet’. However, Schenkel and Schenkel-Hulliger (1969) reported that Banteng and deer in Ujung Kulon are forced to travel widely in the dry season and ‘feed on bamboo, young palm leaves, bush, and saplings as well’. And the stomachs of a number of bulls which were shot in the South Tjiandur region of Java were almost completely full of non-graminaceous species. In Pananjung-Pangandaran Reserve in West Java Banteng were observed to graze on a variety of plants but appeared to prefer the grasses <em>Ischaemum muticum, Axonopus compressus, Paspalum conjugatum,</em> and <em>Cynodon dactylon</em>; and a woody forest shrub. Grazing intensity was lower in the forest than in the open fields where it was inversely proportional to the amount of <em>Eupatorium odoratum</em>&#160;(= <em>Chromolaena odorata</em>) and <em>Imperata cylindrica&#160;</em>although they did eat these species (Sumardja and Kartawinata 1977). In Sabah, Banteng was found to forage on eight species found within open canopy sites: <em>Mikania cordata</em>,&#160;<em>Eupatorium odoratum</em>, <em>Cyperus difformis</em>, <em>Fibristylis littoralis</em>, <em>Scleria</em> sp,,&#160;<em>Dismodium triflorium</em>, <em>Eleusine indica</em>, and <em>Selaginella</em> sp.&#160;<br/> <br/>When undisturbed, Banteng displays a more or less fixed diurnal pattern of behaviour with periods (usually two to three hours long) of feeding alternating with rest periods of a similar length during which the animals ruminate. In areas which are subject to frequent human disturbance it becomes rather nocturnal and generally enters open areas only at night, although in especially attractive localities it will tolerate human presence to a certain extent (Halder 1976). In undisturbed areas Bantengs ‘do not differentiate much in their activities between day and night, but...really large assemblages on open plains occur almost exclusively by day...This round the clock activity (which is, however, interrupted countless times to rest and/or ruminate) may not be regarded as abnormal’ (Hoogerwerf 1970: 211-212).</span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-CA"">In undisturbed forest habitat in Sabah (Malaysia Borneo) Banteng activity peaks at dawn and during the early morning hours of 05:00-07:00 hours when the animals emerge from the forest to forage and socialize. Activity decreases mid-morning until early afternoon when they rest and ruminate and at dusk, a second peak in activity occurs during which they forage and socialize (Gardner 2015). Banteng activity decreases around 20:00-21:00 hours and again at 03:00-04:00; the reasons for this are unknown <span lang=""EN-CA"">(<span lang=""EN-CA"">Melletti and Burton 2014, Gardner, 2015)<span lang=""EN-CA"">. Analysis of 160 Banteng camera-trap encounters from the Cambodian Eastern Plains showed nocturnal activity with over 80% of encounters between 18:00 and 06:00 hours <span lang=""EN-CA"">(Gray and Phan 2011)<span lang=""EN-CA"">.<br/> <br/>The basic social group appears to be female–juvenile unit (as in the other large Asian Bovini) with larger groups tending to be more-or-less temporary assemblages. Maternal herds containing several adult cows, juveniles, and calves occur; these groups can often contain one or more subadult and adult males. Groups of cows without calves are also seen. For much of the year (adult) Bantengs are largely sexually segregated and all-male groups are frequently encountered at this time. Solitary animals tend to be mature bulls or sometimes old cows. The composition of small groups of cows with calves or juveniles, and the solitary state of old individuals may remain the same for months or even years. The composition of other small groups, particularly the unisex groups, usually varies from day to day. During the mating season the male groups disband and dominant males compete for access to receptive females (Hoogerwerf 1970, Halder 1976, S. Hedges unpubl. data 1991-2002).&#160;In large open areas small herds of Banteng and solitary individuals regularly gather to form large temporary assemblages. These large herds will often spend up to two days together during which time they will forage and ruminate, socialize, and re-establish their hierarchy.</span></span></span></p><p><span lang=""EN-CA""><span lang=""EN-CA""><span lang=""EN-CA""><span lang=""EN-CA"">Large herds of more than 100 animals have been reported in Java&#160;but these herds appear to be temporary associations formed when smaller groups and solitary animals arrive in an area to feed and the animals tend to reform into smaller groups when they leave the feeding areas. The composition of these groups often varies on a daily basis although there may be a stable nucleus of animals which returns to the same clearing day after day. The large herds may have an established dominance hierarchy but it seems to vary depending on the habitat. In more densely vegetated areas solitary animals or small groups, generally with fewer than eight animals, are more typical (Halder 1973, 1976; S. Hedges unpubl. data 1991–2002). In the Eastern Plains Landscape, Cambodia, mean Banteng herd size (estimated from counting individuals in independent camera-trap encounters) was 2.6 individuals with 14% of encounters estimated to comprise groups of more than five individuals <span lang=""EN-CA"">(Phan and Gray 2010)<span lang=""EN-CA"">.<br/> <br/> In Thailand the mating season is in May and June (Lekagul and McNeely 1977); while breeding reportedly occurs the whole year round in Myanmar (Peacock 1933). Wharton (1957) collected information from Cambodians living within Banteng habitat which suggested that the majority of births occurred in December and January which, assuming a gestation period of about 10 months, suggests that most conceptions take place in March and April. However, Hermanns (cited in Hoogerwerf 1970) was of the opinion that Bantengs in mainland Asia mate from September to October. Hoogerwerf (1970) recorded mating taking place all year round in West Java but there was a peak of activity in October; and he thought that those cows which mated outside the peak period were probably exceptional. He was of the opinion that Bantengs in both East and West Java generally calved in July and August which would suggest that mating generally took place from October to December; more recent observations in East Java have also revealed evidence of year-round matings (neonates have been seen in all months) but with an apparent peak of births between June and September (S. Hedges unpubl. data 1991–2002).</span></span></span></p>","The major threats to Banteng throughout its&#160;range are hunting and increasing loss of habitat (Duckworth and Hedges 1998, Pudyatmoko 2004, Steinmetz 2004, S. Hedges unpub. data 1991–2002, T. Gray pers. comm. 2013). In Viet Nam and Lao PDR where the rate of lowland forest loss is also accelerating habitat loss is primarily a concern for the future viability of national populations, the species having been hunted out of forests long before they are cleared. In Indochina generally, habitat loss and fragmentation are secondary to hunting, largely acting indirectly by increasing accessibility of remnant Banteng populations to hunting. In mainland South-east Asia hunting is the main direct threat and the species has been lost from much of its former range, even where suitable habitat remains (Duckworth and Hedges 1998, Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Tordoff <em>et al</em>. 2005, R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2013). Hunting is exacerbated especially in mainland South-east Asia by human repopulation of lowland forest areas and associated habitat fragmentation, that is, the very areas where most Bantengs occur (Duckworth and Hedges 1998, Timmins and Ou 2001, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Although huge tracts of suitable habitat were lost in the twentieth century, and continue to be converted, this has probably occurred&#160;largely&#160;after Banteng was hunted out (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Thus, the hunting is the proximate cause of decline, but habitat loss is continually reducing the maximum population possible if hunting issues were to be controlled, and is increasing the ease with which remaining animals can be hunted. The recent granting of large-scale economic land concessions for industrial agriculture (particularly rubber plantations) is a significant threat to remaining lowland deciduous forest (and hence Banteng habitat) in northern and eastern Cambodia. Large areas of the species’ current Cambodian range (including inside protected areas) are threatened through land concessions (T. Gray pers. comm. 2013);&#160;however 2016 changes in the management of forests and protected areas by the Royal Government of Cambodia may have mitigated this threat to an extent (T. Gray in litt. 2016).&#160;The magnitude of the threat posed to Banteng by international trade in trophy horns is difficult to quantify. Nevertheless, given the small size of the remaining Banteng population and the number of trophies found for sale in Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand, and Viet Nam, during what were essentially opportunistic surveys, it is clearly a major threat on the Asian mainland (Srikosamatara <em>et al</em>. 1992; Baird 1993; Srikosamatara and Suteethorn 1994, 1995; Martin and Phipps 1996; Srifa La-Ong <em>et al</em>. 1997; Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999; Timmins and Ou 2001). The threat posed by use of traditional medicinal substances derived from wild oxen is even harder to determine in the case of Banteng and essentially remains unknown, although it is thought to be a source of significant threat to Gaur (see 2008 Red List account). A growing regional economy has increased rather than decreased the demand for natural resources, Banteng amongst them, and the potential benefits of hunting Banteng with possibilities of significant market value in the form of wild meat, trophies and traditional medicines must make it a lucrative target.<br/>The most important population in Cambodia is scattered through a forest landscape that encompasses four provinces (Mondulkiri, Kratie, Stung Treng and Ratanakiri) and five conservation areas (Lomphat Wildlife Sanctuary, Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary, Siema Protection Forest, Mondulkiri and O’Yadao Protected Forests Timmins and Ou 2001, Tordoff <em>et al</em>. 2005, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Hunting is still rife in much of this area, and forest fragmentation is rapidly accelerating with human population in-migration, infrastructural developments (especially roads), commercial agricultural expansion, economic land speculation and mineral extraction (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Banteng remain actively&#160;targeted for hunting for meat and trophy antlers in Cambodia serving both domestic and regional, particularly Vietnamese, markets. For example in the first half of 2016 a minimum of six Banteng were known to be poached from&#160;Mondulkiri Protected Forest and Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary (WWF in litt. 2016). Banteng meat is also regularly confiscated by enforcement agencies within Mondulkiri province and poaching, both targeted and as by-catch from snares, is a substantial threat to all Cambodian populations. However, although perhaps less than 20% of this area is well protected from the aforementioned threats and protected area management is only close to effective in three areas, the most significant issue concerning the area is the long-term uncertainty of continuation of effective conservation management of Mondulkiri Protected Forest, Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary and Siema Protection Forest (T. Gray pers. comm. 2013). Although conservation efforts for Banteng and many other species have been, in all three areas, extremely encouraging for some years as of 2016, they face an uncertain future with the possibility of de-gazettment of conservation status of parts of them, the possible loss of adequate external funding necessary to maintain high standards of management, the possible loss of political support necessary to uphold high protection standards and the uncertainties of maintaining a motivated and well-trained staff. Indeed since 2011 accelerating threats to all three protected areas, largely driven through commercial logging of high-value timber species, is causing widespread ungulate hunting (T. Gray pers. comm. 2013).&#160;<strong>&#160;</strong>In most cases the remaining Banteng populations are well isolated from cattle including the domestic oxen. In Cambodia, the Eastern plains population is still large and thus probably unlikely to be effected by rare introgression events.&#160;In Thailand one population of Banteng in Khao Ang Rue Nai Wildlife Sanctuary suffered declines in past years and, as a result, experienced a population genetic bottle-neck (N. Bhampakphan pers. comm. 2013); the loss of genetic diversity potentially increases the susceptibility of deleterious genetic defects and risk of disease in the future. Genetic introgression from non-native Banteng is a threat; Banteng sampled from the western and eastern regions of Thailand identified eight haplotypes using the cytochrome b gene and control region (1079 bp). The highest diversity (six haplotypes) was found in Huai Kha Khaend Wildlife Sanctuary however two haplotypes (seven individuals) from Lam Pao Dam, Kalasin province, were classified as Javan Banteng <em>Bos javanicus javanicus </em>(W. Wajjwalku and W. Klinsawat pers. comm. 2013).&#160;In addition to the genetic threat, domestic livestock are a potential source of diseases and parasites. This can have very serious consequences for Banteng which appears to be particularly susceptible to a number of cattle diseases; for example, Banteng populations in Myanmar have in the past been very badly affected by diseases from domestic cattle (Hundley cited in Wharton 1968).<br/><br/>In Sabah habitat loss to permanent agriculture is a serious and ongoing threat (P. Gardner pers. comm. 2013). In areas of Sabah where habitat loss is not absolute, the Banteng seeks refuge in dense forest patches generally found at higher elevations because they are unsuitable for harvesting and agriculture (P. Gardner pers. obs). Disturbance from agriculture and logging intervals in commercially managed forest also causes displacement and stress, potentially influencing breeding of Banteng (P. Gardner pers. obs). Hunting is equally significant and the species has been rapidly exterminated from many areas (Payne <em>et al</em>. 1985, Ahmad AH pers. comm. 2008). Rampant hunting in Sabah now targets remnant herds, removing mature breeding individuals important for sustaining herds (P. Gardner pers. obs).&#160;On Java some populations are potentially threatened by heavy predation from Dhole&#160;<em>Cuon alphinus</em> (Hedges and Tyson 1996, Pudyatmoko 2004). All populations are also threatened by poaching and some, perhaps most, are threatened by habitat loss and degradation (S. Hedges unpub. data 1991–2002). During the 1980s–1990s, when poaching and land conversion were relatively well under control in Javan national parks, the chief threat to the large population of Banteng in Baluran National Park was loss of grazing area to invasion by the introduced tree <em>Acacia nilotica</em> (Leguminosae) that converts open grassland to dense thorny scrub-forest. This plant was introduced (without adequate risk assessment) as part of an attempt to create a living fire-break around the park's grasslands, wild fire then being adjudged the major threat to the park’s monsoon forests. Since that introduction, repeated cutting of the acacia has led to coppicing into very dense thickets that contain little or no grass or other herbs and are difficult for the cattle to penetrate. Thus habitat loss and poaching are now serious limiting factors in Baluran National Park, and habitat loss/degradation remains a severe long-term threat to be addressed (S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008). <em>Lantana camar</em><em>a</em> (Verbenaceae) is also a problem in Banteng habitat in Baluran National Park and elsewhere on Java (S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>Bali cattle have long been interbred with other cattle: Banteng and Bali cattle can interbreed with both common cattle and Mithan <em>Bos frontalis&#160;</em>(Fischer 1980, National Research Council 1983). Hybrids between Banteng and common cattle <em>Bos taurus</em>&#160;of the zebu type are fully fertile; in hybrids between Banteng and <em>Bos taurus</em> of the European type the males are sterile (Jellinek <em>et al</em>. 1980, National Research Council 1983). Domestic and feral livestock are thus a potential threat to the genetic integrity of wild Banteng populations and a number of reports suggest that wild Banteng does interbreed with domestic cattle. For example, Hoogerwerf (1970) referred to several sources from the 1930s and 1940s which mention that many groups of Banteng in Kalimantan (particularly East Kalimantan) were no longer pure-bred having interbred with stray domestic cattle. Wharton (1957) also found evidence of interbreeding with domestic cattle in Cambodia; and reports from Myanmar mention that Bantengs feed alongside village cattle and occasionally interbreed with them (Tun Yin 1967, Salter 1983).&#160;<br/><br/>Hunting for Banteng trophy heads continues to threaten the population in Sabah and Kalimantan. Reports suggest an international trade in trophy heads originating from Kalimantan and sold across the Sabah border however first-hand accounts have yet to be substantiated. The majority of trophy heads and horns encountered in 2012 and 2013 were found in wildlife displays by government departments. Encounters of trophy heads are made in rural villages but are generally infrequent because&#160;of&#160;the fear of reprisal by wildlife authorities but also the demand for horns for use in soups.<br/><br/>Introgression with domestic cattle is not believed to be a current threat to Banteng in Sabah but genetic studies are in their infancy. Poor management of domestic cattle has the potential to cause introgression; one old report suggested a feral Bali cow or a Banteng/Bali cow hybrid with (white spotted) pelage was hunted within the south-west of Sabah. A separate report suggested domestic cattle were left in abandoned logging camps in Deramakot Forest Reserve at some point in the past three decades and may have interbred with wild Banteng. In the majority of locations that utilize domestic cattle their security is maintained with fenced enclosures. Water Buffaloes are frequently used in the harvesting of oil palm fruit, and are frequently grazed along forest boundaries. In 2012 in east Sabah, Water Buffaloes were found approximately 200 m from wild Banteng. &#160;The genetic integrity of Banteng is of primary concern in Sabah, where fragmentation and isolation of populations now prevents movement of individuals and the transmission of genes between populations. The removal of mature individuals by illegal hunting will disrupt breeding behaviour and the social structure of the herds, in addition to the direct loss of genetic diversity. Small and isolated populations are susceptible to inbreeding, which will undoubtedly lead to a loss of allelic diversity and increase the risk of identical genotypes. Genetic homogeneity in the Banteng will decrease their overall fitness, and their ability to resist diseases and deleterious genetic mutations. Active genetic management of wild Banteng stock in Sabah is most likely to be the only way to prevent loss of genetic diversity and the imminent threat of extinction.","<p><span lang=""EN-CA""></p><p>The world population of Banteng is likely to be approximately 8,000 individuals of which approximately 4,600 occur in a single subpopulation in eastern Cambodia (Gray <em>et al</em>. 2012. 2016). Outside eastern Cambodia only 6-8 subpopulations of more than 50 animals, are known, with 4–5 on Java, 1–2 in Thailand (S. Hedges pers. comm. 2000, Pudyatmoko 2004), and possibly one in Sabah (P. Gardner pers. comm. 2013). A once fairly widely distributed species, it is now largely reduced to small isolated populations, most of which are still in decline.</p><p>In Cambodia, Banteng probably declined by 90% or more between the late 1960s and the early 1990s. At this latter time it still remained widespread, although in generally low numbers, in the lowland forests of the north and east, and also, probably somewhat more sporadically, in the south and west including the Cardamom Mountain range (Heng Kimchhay <em>et al</em>. 1998,&#160;Daltry and Momberg 2000,&#160;Timmins and Ou 2001, R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). From at least this time onwards the most substantial Banteng population has been centred on Mondulkiri province where in the late 1990s it was at the time thought that at least several hundred to a perhaps over a thousand Banteng survived in a forested landscape of over 15,000 km² (Timmins and Ou 2001, Tordoff <em>et al</em>. 2005, R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). This was clearly a considerable underestimate as recent systematic surveys have estimated the population to be much larger (see below). Further declines took place from the early 1990s to the mid 2000s, with quite probably more than a 50% decline in this time period for the nation as a whole, and the resultant loss of Banteng populations from significant parts of the still forested landscape (Timmins and Ou 2001, Timmins <em>et al</em>. 2003, Timmins 2006, Bezuijen <em>et al</em>. 2008, R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Intensive distance-based line transects conducted between 2009 and 2011 across 3,400 km² of the core areas of Mondulkiri Protected Forest and Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary estimated a Banteng population of 3,200 individuals (95% CI range 1,980-5,170) <span lang=""EN-CA"">(Gray <em>et al</em>. 2012)<span lang=""EN-CA"">.&#160;This was higher than previously believed; the 2008 IUCN Red List assessment suggesting no subpopulation globally exceeded 500 individuals (Timmins <em>et al</em>. 2008). Repeat surveys during the 2013/14 dry-season of the cores of Mondulkiri Protected Forest and Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary suggested the Banteng population in these areas was stable in comparison with 2009/2011 data: between 600 and 1,600 individuals in the core of Mondulkiri Protected Forest (analogous to Mondulkiri Protected Forest inner core in Gray <em>et al</em>. 2012) and 830 – 3,200 in the core of Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary (T.N.E. Gray pers. comm. 2016). Given the presence in the adjacent Seima Protection Forest (500 individuals based on 2014 line-transect density estimates; M. Maltby in litt. 2015) and outside the core of Mondulkiri Protected Forest the landscape population is probably around 4,600 individuals. However accelerating threats (particularly habitat loss and hunting; see Threats) mean this population is likely to be experiencing an ongoing decline having possibly recovered during the early 2000s following the initiation of law enforcement activities (T. Gray in litt. 2016).&#160;Elsewhere in Cambodia clearance and fragmentation of the once vast lowland forests has accelerated in the last half decade, largely due to the development of agro-industry concessions, as well as the proliferation of piecemeal small-holder farms and other land claims, and this has probably lead to extirpation (due to hunting) from a significant part of the species' former Cambodian range.</span></p><p>The other present-day stronghold of Banteng is Java, where six large subpopulations (those with more than 50 animals) occurred in 1990, but these declined to only 4–5 by 2004 (Pudyatmoko 2004). Pudyatmoko (2004) estimated: Ujung Kulon National Park (300–800 individuals in 2003), Cikepuh-Cibanteng Nature Reserve (25–65 individuals in 2003), Bonjonglarang-Jayanti Region (a small stable population of unknown size in 1988, with no recent data available), Cimapag Region (occurrence recorded until 1970, with current status unknown), Leuweng Sancang Nature Reserve (10 individuals in 2000, extinct in 2003), Cikamurang Region (occurrence recorded until 1970, with current status unknown), Pangandaran Nature Reserve (25–65 individuals in 2003), Kediri Region (occurrence recorded until 1970, with current status unknown), Coast of Blitar (10 individuals in 1988, with current status unknown), Coast of Malang (six individuals in 1988, with current status unknown), Meru Betiri National Park (200 individuals in 2000, with at least 57 individuals in 2002), Alas Purwo National Park (with at least 80 individuals in 2002), and Baluran National Park (around 206 individuals in 2002). Numbers in all areas are declining (Hedges and Tyson 1996, S. Hedges unpub. data. 1991–2002, Pudyatmoko 2004).</p><p><span lang=""EN-CA""> Population numbers and even trends are difficult to quantify for the island of Borneo but there have been declines, especially in Kalimantan (S. Pudyatmoko pers. comm. 2006, G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2006), and in Sabah (P. Gardner pers. comm. 2013). The Bornean population is thought to have been particularly negatively affected by interbreeding with domestic and/or feral oxen of types other than pure-bred ‘Bali Cattle’.&#160;</span></p><p><span lang=""EN-CA"">Up until at least the early twentieth&#160;Century, Banteng was still found throughout what is now Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo), albeit disappearing in some areas (in particular, in South Kalimantan) (Gardner <em>et al</em>. unpubl. data). <a>By the early 2000s</a>, Banteng was thought to be widespread but rare in East Kalimantan, on the basis of recent (mid- and late-1990s) reports from many areas, including Kayan Mentarang National Park (NP), and within or close to Hutan Kapur Sangkulirang (an unprotected area that has been proposed for protection since the early 1980s) (Hedges and Meijaard 1999,&#160;E. Meijaard unpubl. data).&#160;<span lang=""EN-CA"">Banteng persists in East Kalimantan in Kutai National Park; camera trap images confirmed breeding (a female calf approximately 4-5 months old and a bull approx. 3-4 years old) however the population size is thought to be very small, given the lack of recent observations compared with survey effort (S. Cheyne pers. comm. 2013). The species might also persist in&#160;<a>Hutan Kapur Sangkulirang Nature Reserve</a><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span lang=""EN-CA"">, although no recent reports have been confirmed.&#160;A small population was reported from Belantikan Hulu in Central Kalimantan in November 2007 (tracks found) and April 2008 (local reports of capture of cow and calf); the population is believed to be small (T. Simorangkir pers. comm. 2008). This population was reconfirmed in 2013 from camera trap images of a bull and cow but its size remains unknown (Yayorin pers. comm. 2013).&#160;</span></span></p><p>Banteng also occurs along the border with Sarawak in East Kalimantan in Kayan Mentarang (E. Meijaard pers. comm. 2013); in 1999 observations were made of a solitary young bull and a small herd of four individuals (including cows), in addition to tracks and dung signs&#160;<span lang=""EN-CA"">(Hedges and Meijaard 1999)<span lang=""EN-CA"">. There are concerns over the genetic integrity of Banteng in this area because of the presence of domestic cattle, abandoned in 1979 by villagers, which might have interbred with the wild Banteng&#160;<span lang=""EN-CA"">(Hedges and Meijaard 1999)<span lang=""EN-CA"">.</span></span></p><p>In Sarawak (Malaysian Borneo) Banteng was probably largely restricted to the alluvial plains of the coastal belt (Wharton 1968). Low (1848, cited by Wharton 1968) reported that the Banteng in Sarawak lived chiefly in the bamboo forests along the Sangow and Baram Rivers, where according to Banks (1931) domestic Banteng was kept by the Kalabit people (thus raising the possibility that the Banteng populations in Sarawak and neighbouring parts of Kalimantan may be partly feral in origin, or contain hybrid animals) (P. Gardner <em>et al</em>. unpubl. data). Beccari (1904) indicated that the species was not scarce but kept mainly to areas of secondary growth in the interior. Banks (1931) reported that Banteng did not occur south of the Baleh River (a tributary of the Rejang River) in Sarawak, and was found in the headwaters of most rivers to the north of this. He further mentioned the Niah District where Banteng was relatively common, Merapok in the Lawas district, Ulu Trusan, Limbang, various places in the Baram, above Tubau in the Ulu Bintulu, at Belaga and down to the head of the Pelagus rapids, but not into the neighbouring Mukah and Oya Rivers. In the 1950s, Banteng was still common around the Niah Caves but ‘this is one of the few places where it is so in Borneo today’ (Harrisson 1961), and by 1967 few Bantengs were thought to be left in Sarawak (Anderson, pers. comm. to Wharton 1968). In the early 1980s, Banteng apparently persisted in the more remote parts of north and east Sarawak (Aken and Kavanagh 1982), but Payne <em>et al</em>. (1985) stated that there had been no recent reports [although Labang (1987 cited by Caldecott, 1988) reportedly found evidence of their continued presence]. However, few, if any Bantengs persist in Sarawak as of 2016, although they may cross into Sarawak from neighbouring Kalimantan, where they were known to occur in the large Kayan Mentarang NP at least until the late 1990s (Hedges and Meijaard 1999).</p><p>The population in Sabah (Malaysian Borneo) is in decline primarily because of continual loss of habitat, human disturbance causing displacement, and rampant hunting (P. Gardner pers. obs). Quantifying accurate population sizes are problematic and continue to be confounded by a range of issues including the inhospitable habitat, the shy nature of the species, and detection and quantification of the species. Prior to the 1940s, Banteng was reported to be common in riverine areas in the east, and in many areas of shifting cultivation. However, the subsequent widespread use of firearms led to the species's rapid extermination from most areas. In 1982, it was reported to be locally common in logged forest on flat terrain, but under threat as its habitat was converted into permanent agricultural land (Davies and Payne 1982).&#160;</p><p>The state-wide population estimate in 1982 was 300-550 individuals <span lang=""EN-CA"">(Davies and Payne 1982)<span lang=""EN-CA""> but this was based on community surveys in accessible locations and did not include all Banteng populations. The biggest population decline occurred during the intensive and extensive timber operation and transformation of lowland forests large-scale plantations (palm oil, cocoa and other crops) late in the twentieth century (Ahmad AH pers. comm. 2008). During this period (years 1970-2000) of intensification,&#160;the decline in Banteng was thought to be over 50% in Sabah and Borneo as a whole&#160;(B. Giman pers. comm. 2008).&#160;In 1990, Banteng still occurred south of Gunung Lumaku (in the upper reaches of the Padas River) but it had been extirpated from all other parts of south-western Sabah according to local people (Payne 1990).</span></p><p><span lang=""EN-CA""><span lang=""EN-CA"">Since this time, new road infrastructure has opened up the interior of Sabah and vast land-use changes continue to remove much of the natural forest habitat. Encroachment and hunting has undoubtedly increased over the past four decades as a result of habitat conversion and extensive networks of logging roads. Some populations are known to have been eradicated in the past three decades, and the current population size is very likely to be less than 350 individuals.&#160;Introgression with domestic cattle has not been observed in five forests containing Banteng, surveyed over the past three years, although reports suggested domestic cattle were abandoned at logging camps and interbred with wild Banteng in Dermakot Forest Reserve. The potential for disease transmission from domestic livestock is unquestionable as Banteng is found in close proximity to water buffalo and cows in forest habitat located adjacent to plantations and private land. As of 2016, rampant hunting continues to deplete remnant populations (P. Gardner pers. obs). The security of Banteng is further compromised in locations where the animals move between protected forest and timber plantations, privately-owned forest and grassland to search for forage (P. Gardner pers. obs). In one area, Bantengs are encouraged into privately owned grassland managed for recreational sport hunting (P. Gardner pers. obs). Otherwise, populations in Sabah are now confined to remote forest and swamp habitat which are highly fragmented; the prevention of gene-flow between fragmented populations may compromise the genetic-integrity of future generations. Timber plantations are not considered to be a main habitat of Banteng due to the temporary status of the forest and the regular eradication of the vegetation which forces the Banteng into nearby natural forest. Between 2009 and 2015, remnant subpopulations were confirmed on the east coast in Kulamba Wildlife Reserve, and Tabin Wildlife Reserve (approximately 52 individuals). In the central and southern reserves including Dermakot Forest Reserve, Tangkulap Forest Reserve, Segaluid Forest Reserve, Malua Forest Reserve (approximately 35 individuals), Ulu-Segama Malua Forest Reserve, Danum Valley Conservation Area, and Maliau Basin Conservation Area [over 10 individuals]&#160;<span lang=""EN-CA""><span lang=""EN-CA"">(Melletti and Burton 2014)<span lang=""EN-CA"">. On the south west coast there is a small population (size unknown) in Sipitang Forest Reserve, and Banteng was recently confirmed as present in Sapulut Forest Reserve. Unconfirmed populations may also persist on the west, north and north-east coast of Sabah. Subpopulations thought to have gone extinct since <span lang=""EN-CA"">1982<span lang=""EN-CA"">&#160;include herds in the Dent peninsular, Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary and Kinabatangan district, Beaufort district, Keningau district, and Kudat and Murudu Bay. At least four populations successfully bred in years 2009-2013 (P. Gardner pers. obs) but during this time, hunting simultaneously removed mature individuals.</span></span></span></p><p>In Thailand, the only subpopulations with more than 50 animals are Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary and perhaps Kaeng Krachan National Park. In Kaeng Krachan National Park the density of Banteng is thought to be low; the situation has not significantly improved and there is no obvious hope for recovery of the population (A. Pattanavibool pers. comm. 2013). Smaller numbers do or may persist in Mae Ping National Park, Phu Luang Wildlife Sanctuary, Thap Lan National Park, Khao Ang Ruenai Wildlife Sanctuary, Khao Soi Dao Wildlife Sanctuary, Khao Sok National Park, Kui Buri National Park (approx. 3 individuals remain) and Pang Sida National Park (signs of a small herd) (R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2013). Banteng are also found in the Western Forest Complex but continue to face serious fragmentation and poaching for meat and parts (A. Pattanavibool pers. comm. 2013). Recovery of this population is still considered very limited and is only applicable to areas where habitat remains and where there is good protection (A. Pattanavibool pers. comm. 2013). Banteng range probably declined by approximately 85% in Thailand from 1980 to 2000 (S. Hedges pers. comm. 2000). The Banteng population in Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary (one of few &gt;50) did not increase during years 2006-2008 (per R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2008) however it persists as of 2013&#160;<span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span lang=""EN-CA"">(N. Bhampakhan pers. comm. 2013). Banteng is one of the significant ecosystem engineers wi<span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span lang=""EN-CA"">thin this fire-prone landscape but is threatened by a lack of forage as a result of post-fire regeneration of highly invasive evergreen species which smoother the ground and prevent the growth of important grasses (N. Bhampakphan pers. comm. 2013). A population in Khao Ang Rue Nai Wildlife Sanctuary in the east of Thailand is reported to be increasing from a population genetic bottle-neck (N. Bhampakhan pers. comm. 2013). The Thai Banteng populations outside Huai Kha Khaeng and Khao Ang Rue Nai however are not increasing and for this reason it is imperative to maintain the status of Banteng within the protected reserves&#160;<span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span lang=""EN-CA"">(N. Bhampakhan pers. comm. 2013).<span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span lang=""EN-CA"">&#160;</span></span></span></span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-CA""><span lang=""EN-CA"">Numbers in Lao PDR are now likely to be very low (Duckworth and Hedges 1998, Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, T. Gray pers. comm. 2013). Evidence of Banteng was found for a number of areas in the 1990s (Duckworth and Hedges 1998, Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Steinmetz 2004), but there has been very little survey effort since 1998. Confirmation of presence after the mid-1990s, when populations were in steep decline (Duckworth and Hedges 1998), is lacking. Most areas have received little if any protection: so it is quite likely that Banteng has been hunted out from several, perhaps most, conceivably all, of them (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). The most likely areas for continued presence are in the southern half of the country; it is possible that no populations greater than 10 individuals remain (T. Gray pers. comm. 2013), and populations of conservation significance are only conceivable in perhaps two to three areas, two of which lie along the international border with Cambodia (R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2008). A similar scenario is likely in Viet Nam, although persistence is more likely (R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2008). Pedrono <em>et al</em>. <span lang=""EN-CA"">(2009)<span lang=""EN-CA""> estimated the overall population, in five contiguous<span lang=""EN-CA""> areas in the Eastern Highlands, as between 74 and 103 individuals; the largest populations were in Yok Don National Park (30-44 individuals) and Ea So Nature Reserve (23-31 individuals). Reports however suggest that management conditions and illegal activities may have led to declines in the relatively high profile Yok Don NP, leaving in question the status of the species in lower profile areas (R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2008).</span></span></span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-CA"">Little recent information has been traced from Myanmar: a national camera-trapping survey aimed at the Tiger <em>Panthera tigris</em>, which will not necessarily have covered all, or even the best, areas for Banteng, recorded it in and around Alaungdaw Kathapa National Park, Mahamyaing Reserve Forest, and the central Bago (Pegu) Yoma (Lynam 2003). Current numbers are unknown but are sure to be declining, given general trends in ungulates in better-studied parts of the country. There are no quantitative data available on numbers remaining in China, but there are, if any, at most very few.</p><p><span lang=""EN-CA""> A domesticated form of Banteng, often called ‘Bali Cattle’, and considered to be the same species (contrasting with general taxonomic treatment for several other oxen) occurs widely in Indonesia and has been introduced to other areas of the world. However, few if any populations of this form are now likely to be pure-bred, because of interbreeding with domestic oxen derived from other <em>Bos</em> species (Bradshaw <em>et al</em>. 2006). One population of approximately 6,000 animals, which appears now to be superficially indistinguishable from wild Banteng, thrives in Garig Gunak Barlu National Park, on the Cobourg Peninsula in Northern Territory, Australia. These animals derive from approximately 20 domesticated ‘Banteng’ taken from Denpasar, Bali in 1849, and they have recently been shown to be genetically indistinguishable from wild Banteng, at least to the extent of the molecular sequences analysed. This suggests that they have not been cross-bred previously to any significant extent with other domestic cattle (Bradshaw <em>et al</em>. 2006). Some domestic oxen lineages in mainland South-east Asia, for instance in Cambodia, may have at least partial Banteng ancestry (e.g. Timmins and Ou 2001).</span></p>",Decreasing,"<p><span lang=""EN-CA"">The species historically occurred from southern China (Yunnan) and, probably, northeast India throughout mainland southeast Asia, through Peninsular Malaysia to the islands of Borneo, Java, and probably Bali (see below).&#160;</p><p><span lang=""EN-CA"">No fossil evidence is known from Bali, and Grubb (2005) stated that Banteng was introduced to the island; Corbet and Hill (1992) did not include Bali in the range of wild Banteng and various other sources simply state that it occurs as domestic animals. Nevertheless, it does not seem unreasonable to suggest that Banteng should be included among the native fauna of Bali since several Indo-Malayan animal species are known to have penetrated eastwards as far as Flores and Timor during times of lowered sea-levels in the Pleistocene (Hooijer 1975). On Borneo (East Kalimantan, Indonesia), ancient cave art (circa 10,000 BP) depicting a bovid figure, thought to be <em>Bos javanicus</em>, was found in 1994 <span lang=""EN-CA"">(Chazine 2005)<span lang=""EN-CA"">, which suggests the natural range of Banteng extended up until Wallace’s line. Ashby and Santiapillai (1988) treated the small number of free-living Bantengs which in occur in west Bali as wild animals as did Watling (1991); although Watling noted that interbreeding with domestic Bali cattle is a problem and the population is unlikely to consist solely of pure-bred animals. Wind and Amir (1977) had earlier raised similar fears.<span lang=""EN-CA""></span></span></p><p><span lang=""EN-CA"">Domestic Banteng has been introduced to several of the islands of eastern Indonesia including Sulawesi, Sumbawa, and Sumba (van der Maarel 1932, Rollinson 1984). Feral Banteng occurs in Kalimantan (National Research Council 1983). Introduced Banteng (probably feral animals) occur on the Indonesian islands of Enggano (off Sumatra) and Sangihe (off Sulawesi) (Corbet and Hill 1992, Grubb 2005). Domestic Banteng has also been introduced to New Guinea and Australia and there are now large feral herds in the Northern Territory (Kirby 1979, Bowman 1993, Bradshaw <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/> <br/> Wild Banteng currently occurs on Java and possibly Bali, in Kalimantan [Indonesian Borneo], Sabah [part of Malaysian Borneo], Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia and, probably,&#160;Lao PDR and Viet Nam.&#160;<span lang=""EN-CA"">It is likely that the small remaining Banteng population in Sarawak [Malaysian Borneo] reported in 1988 (D. Labang, cited in Caldecott 1988) is now extinct. Banteng is also thought to be extinct in Brunei [Borneo] (Payne <em>et al</em>. 1985),&#160;Bangladesh (Gittins and Akonda 1982,&#160;Md Anwarul Islam <em>in litt</em>.&#160;2008), and in India (Prater 1971, IUCN 1978), if it ever occurred there: Groves (2003) stated that “there have been constant reports from Manipur, but there is as yet no confirmation”. In West Malaysia it has probably been extinct since at least the 1950s (Hislop 1961). Medway (1983) thought that Banteng may have still occurred in parts of Kedah and Kelantan after that time, but there have been no recent records. In China, Banteng has been reported to occur in one area of southeast Yunnan, around Tongbiguan Nature Reserve, along the border with Myanmar; however, the evidence for this is unclear; and presence in China should be considered tentative at best.</span></p><p><span lang=""EN-CA""><span lang=""EN-CA""> One of the largest and most important populations of Banteng remains in the west of Thailand in the protected Wildlife Sanctuary Huay Kha Khaeng (R. Steinmetz and N. Bhumpakphan pers. comm. 2013), with tiny remnant populations in Kui Buri National Park in the southern province close to the Myanmar border and in the east in Pangsida National Park (R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2013). Small populations also persist in protected forest within the east including Pangsida National Park, Ta Phraya National Park and Dong Yai Wildlife Sanctuary with a larger population in Khao Ang Rue Nai Wildlife Sanctuary (N. Bhumpakphan pers. comm. 2013). In Cambodia a substantial population remains in the east, within protected areas of Mondulkiri Province (see Population) <span lang=""EN-CA"">(Gray <em>et al</em>.&#160;2012)<span lang=""EN-CA"">. The species was until very recently likely to have been widespread in the northern and eastern forests as well as parts of the Cardamom Mountain range, but with the onset of rampant agroforestry enterprises and other forms of land-grabbing concessions occupied Cambodian range is likely to have significantly decreased in the last half decade. The bulk of the Cambodian population remains in protected areas in the eastern forests, centred on Mondulkiri province (see Population).&#160;</span></span></p><p><span lang=""EN-CA""><span lang=""EN-CA""><span lang=""EN-CA""><span lang=""EN-CA"">On Borneo, the species occurs in isolated parts of Sabah (Malaysia Borneo) along the east coast including Tabin Wildlife Reserve, in the central and southern forest reserves including Malua Forest Reserve and Maliau Basin Conservation Area, and in secluded patches in the south west of Sabah close to the Kalimantan/Sarawak border. Reports of Banteng along the north and north east coast of Sabah suggest small populations persist in highly fragmented habitat although these are yet to be confirmed. In Kalimantan (Indonesia Borneo), it occurs along the border with Sarawak (Malaysia) in East Kalimantan in Kayan Mentarang (E. Meijaard pers. comm. 2013), Kutai National Park (S. Cheyne pers. comm. 2013)<span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span lang=""EN-CA"">, and in Central Kalimantan in Hulu Belantikan (Yayorin pers. comm. 2013).

Newspaper reports of Banteng hunting in Sabah (Malaysian Borneo) are infrequent and usually arise from tip-offs to the government departments, the true number of successful Banteng hunts are known to be much higher however, due to the number of reports obtained from locals and timber contractors, the high frequency of photographic captures of hunters, and the reports of intimidation of forest rangers by military personnel and officials conducting sport hunting within protected forests. Occasionally Banteng horns can be found at local markets in Sabah and their use is thought to be for soups (to increase general vitality) and as a tool to rub or scratch the skin (the latter may have been a misleading interpretation however).&#160;<br/>There are a number of captive animals within zoos and other menageries, but these constitute an insignificant offtake in recent years from wild populations.<br/>There is a domesticated form of Banteng, but its uses supply needs/markets independent of those supplied by wild caught animals.&#160;Uses of the domesticated form of Banteng are not considered here, nor are the uses of feral Australian populations.",Terrestrial,"This species is legally protected in all range states. A proposal for inclusion into CITES Appendix 1 was submitted (Hedges 1996) however there have been no developments and the species is not currently listed.<br/><br/>The most significant known Banteng populations remaining are in Java, Cambodia and perhaps Thailand and Borneo (Sabah, Malaysia), and it is in these countries and around these populations that conservation efforts should be focused.<br/><br/>Banteng is mainly confined to protected areas throughout southeast Asia (see Population), with the probable exception of Cambodia. Banteng presence in Lao protected areas is currently uncertain but there are at least 10 large forested protected areas in the south which might still support the species as well as three to four areas further north, but any populations are certainly not large. In Viet Nam, the species probably now occurs in only a few protected areas (see Population). In Myanmar, Banteng can be found in protected national parks and forest reserves.&#160;&#160;<br/><br/>In Cambodia, most of the large forested protected areas, of which there are more than 15, are likely to retain at least residual Banteng populations. Unfortunately, in most protected areas of Lao PDR, Viet Nam and Cambodia which still retain Banteng, protected status offers little if any protection to the species (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Exceptions are Mondulkiri Protected Forest, Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary and Siema Biodiversity Conservation Area in Cambodia; and there are now even signs of population recovery in these areas (WCS unpublished data; WWF unpublished data). The immediate conservation needs for the large Mondulkiri-centred Cambodian population are to continue strengthening site-based conservation management, in particular of the&#160;Mondulkiri Protected Forest, Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary and&#160;and Siema Biodiversity Conservation Area, and laying the necessary groundwork to ensure that such management can be continued indefinitely.<br/><br/>Java has highly fragmented natural habitats and has done for centuries, reflecting longstanding high human population densities. Many protected areas were established during the Dutch colonial period but from independence up until the 1970s they were largely under-funded and neglected. After hosting the World Parks Conference in 1982, the Indonesian government gazetted a swathe of national parks and more structured conservation planning began, funded by the World Bank and other donors. The focus was largely on the 'multi-function' national parks and much money was spent on infrastructure, some staff training and increased personnel. The 'lesser' protected areas such as ""game reserves"" and ""nature reserves"" still had few staff and resources, and that has continued to the present. There was some habitat loss from protected areas through illegal logging, agricultural encroachment and other off-take, but the national parks of Java (several of which contain ideal habitat for Banteng and, at least into the mid 1990s, large populations) remained remarkably close to intact for much of the period. During the 1980s and early to mid 1990s guns were tightly controlled and the military and police were feared and respected. The strong culture of caged bird keeping meant that hunting, including that within protected areas, was primarily for birds and some smaller mammals, through various forms of trapping, including snaring. Thus there was relatively little hunting of Banteng and populations were stable or even increasing. Socio-political changes from 1997 led to a reduction in the respect for the police and military and the rise of a viewpoint that protected areas were the people's resources and would therefore benefit from decentralized management (M. Tyson pers. comm. 2008). This policy change, which risked a ‘tragedy of the commons’, has indeed led to increased destruction and poaching in the past decade. Banteng, as a large ungulate, is particularly threatened by this rapid rise in illegal hunting (S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008) and also by expansion of agriculture on Java and other forms of encroachment (G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2008, S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008.). The decentralization of conservation management decisions and actions, macro-economic fluctuations and reduced authority of the law impedes control of illegal hunting (S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008). The Indonesian government has produced a National Strategy and Action Plan for Banteng in 2012 (Pudyatmoko <em>et al</em>. 2012), which it is hoped will raise awareness of their continuing decline and focus conservation efforts on the most important populations.<br/><br/>In Thailand there are two populations thought to contain over 50 individuals, in Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary and Kaeng Krachan National Park. Both areas are under active conservation management.&#160;<br/><br/>In Borneo (Sabah, Malaysia), sub-populations are becoming fragmented, which is therefore limiting the potential for gene-flow, because of large-scale agricultural plantations, newly-developing prawn farms (in north Sabah), and commercial timber plantations. Because of&#160;the difficulties in regulating widespread illegal hunting of Banteng across the state, captive breeding using wild-caught individuals is probably the best method to conserve the remnant genetic diversity and increase numbers for future reintroduction. &#160;<br/><br/>A large feral population of Banteng exists in the northern territories of Australia however this is thought to be derived from Bali cattle (Bradshaw <em>et al</em>. 2006). There is a captive population of Banteng held by various zoos including: Edinburgh Zoo (Scotland, U.K)&#160;(1 bull and 1 cow:&#160;<em>Bos javanicus javanicus</em>), (herd size and subspecies unknown), Chester Zoo (England, U.K),&#160;Saint Louis Zoo (Missouri, U.S.A), Montgomery Zoo (Alabama, U.S.A),&#160;Taronga Western Plains Zoo (New South Wales, Australia),&#160;Malacca Zoo (Peninsula Malaysia), and Lok Kawi Wildlife Park (Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malayisa Borneo).

The last published records of Kouprey were from: Pfeffer (1974<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>in litt</em>. to IUCN/CMC); 1964-1970 period by Pfeffer, when photos were taken, (Pfeffer and Ou Kim-San 1967, Pfeffer 1969); 1969 by J. Mellon who saw two female Koupreys in the Chhep/Melouprey area of Cambodia (J. Mellon<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>in litt</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;to D. Ashwell 1993); and 1963/64 by C. Wharton (Wharton 1966). More recent reports have not been confirmed. An assessment of 90% of camera trap photos from the region including the potential range of the Kouprey was made in 2011; this showed no camera trap images of Kouprey. This shows a period of more than 40 years without confirmed recordings.&#160;Extensive survey work has now documented where significant wild cattle populations remain within the historical range of Kouprey, and in no area other than eastern Cambodia are wild cattle numbers high. In most areas wild cattle numbers are so low that it is no longer conceivable that Kouprey could survive. This is compounded by the observation that Kouprey naturally occurred at lower densities compared with Banteng, and the habitat specificity of Kouprey and its exceptional value in trade.&#160;If a case were to be made for the continued existence of Kouprey it would focus on the fact that none of the landscapes assessed were sufficiently surveyed to rule out the presence of Kouprey because of the scale of effort required, which will be the case for the foreseeable future. Specifically, two sets of camera-trap photos from potentially important areas of eastern Cambodia were not examined.</span></p><p></p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>However, the species is most likely to be extinct. At most, there could only be a few individuals remaining, certainly many fewer than 250 mature individuals, and almost certainly fewer than 50 mature individuals. The high level of hunting in the region has led to a significant decline, suspected at over 80% in the last 30 years (generation length estimated at 8-10 years), with a continued decline in any remaining subpopulations, if in fact it is not already extinct.</p>","Little is known of its biology and ecology, the only significant work being that of Wharton (1957). The species travels in small herds, primarily of females and calves, of up to 20 animals, which commonly associate with Banteng. Mature males form bachelor herds. The Kouprey is reported to have a diet of grasses, sedges, and some browse (Wharton 1957).<br/><br/>The Kouprey was primarily an animal of open deciduous dipterocarp forests, especially those areas with extensive grasslands. Although deciduous dipterocarp forests are extensive in Cambodia, and also in parts of adjoining countries (especially Lao PDR and Viet Nam), the preferred sites of Kouprey are much more localised, and perhaps account for less than 30% of the total area of the lowland mosaic forests dominated by deciduous dipterocarp forest (Timmins and Ou 2001, Tordoff <em>et al</em>. 2005, AWCSG 2011). The species appeared to use patches of mixed deciduous and semi-evergreen forest which also occur in such landscapes. Most of the Kouprey's range lies in a highly seasonal area receiving less than 2,000 mm of precipitation per annum. The terrain in this area is generally flat or undulating lowlands. The presence of pools and mineral licks was certainly important.","Hunting, both for local consumption and for trade (meat and body parts, especially horns and skulls), is (or, if the species is extinct, was) the major threat throughout the Kouprey's range (Duckworth and Hedges 1998, Timmins and Ou 2001, Tordoff <em>et al</em>. 2005). This trade value pre-dates the meteoric rise in volume and financial value of wildlife trade out of Lao PDR, Viet Nam and Cambodia during the 1990s and 2000s. Salter&#160;<em>et al</em>. (1990) found three sets of male and two sets of female Kouprey horns (all reportedly from Cambodia) in a village in southern Champasak Province (southern Lao PDR). The male horns were valued by the owner at USD 4,000 and the female horns at USD 1,600 per set. During a trip to Amphoe Muang (Mukdahan Province, Thailand, on the border with Lao) on 29 March 1991, Kouprey parts were found to be available at one vendor. Horns were not on display but customers could examine photographs in an album: female Kouprey horns were offered at USD 6,000-8,000 per pair and male horns at USD 2,000 per pair. The male horns were polished so that the shredded ends could not be seen. During a second visit (in July 1991) the same vendor's stall was less active and no Kouprey trophies were on offer (although Gaur and Banteng could still be ordered). Wild cattle trophies were on offer at other vendors but no Kouprey horns or skulls were for sale at these stalls (Srikosamatara&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1992). During a visit to Ban Mai (Thai/Lao border) by Srikosamatara and his colleagues in April 1993 a vendor of wildlife products claimed to have sold a pair of Kouprey horns to a Thai buyer for USD 800 two years before. He also claimed to have two more sets of Kouprey horns (both old males) for sale at USD 2,800 and USD 12,000 respectively. Three months later (July 1993) another survey (by I. Baird) found no Kouprey trophies for sale at the same vendors (Srikosamatara and Suteethorn 1994). Bounties for Kouprey trophy horns were still believed to circulate in SE Asia as of 2010 (AWCSG 2011).<br/><br/>Diseases from domestic and/or free-ranging livestock could have disastrous consequences given the already severely reduced Kouprey population. Habitat loss as a result of the rapidly increasing land clearance for cultivation (local and commercial), mining and logging, as well as increasing levels of other human disturbances, are also threats, but are insignificant compared with hunting (Tordoff <em>et al</em>. 2005, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, see also 2008 account for Banteng). Many wildlife species of high monetary value still remain widespread and, relative to neighbouring countries, abundant in the extensive lowland forests of Cambodia, and with the fall of the Khmer Rouge and a rapidly growing free market economy there has been a surge of hunting to supply bushmeat, trophy antler/horn and medicinal markets, which is leading in many cases to very rapid declines in large quarry species (e.g. macaques have declined in some areas by over 90% in as little as five years; Timmins 2006, Bezuijen <em>et al</em>. 2008, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008), thus, however, rare Kouprey becomes it will continually be at risk because, unlike in a single-quarry species system where at certain levels it becomes uneconomic to seek out the last few individuals, hunting levels will remain high, fuelled by returns from the more common species (Duckworth and Hedges 1998, Timmins and Ou 2001, Tordoff <em>et al</em>. 2005, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Wild Oxen in Cambodia are now low in number and in most areas now rare or already hunted out (see IUCN Red List accounts for Banteng, Gaur and Wild Water Buffalo). Knowledge of the Kouprey is widespread among rural people in Cambodia, concerning its rarity and the value of trophies and perhaps other body parts; as such it is a more desirable target than most in Cambodia.","At an international workshop, held in Viet Nam in January 1988, reports were presented which suggested that there were about 27 Koupreys in Viet Nam, possibly 40-100 in the Lao PDR, and up to 200 in Cambodia, with perhaps a seasonal presence of a few animals in Thailand. These figures, which were little more than guesses, suggested that a total of about 100-300 Koupreys still existed in the late1980s. Unfortunately, it now seems that these figures were too optimistic, especially for Lao and Viet Nam where surveys in the 1990s were unable to document even large significant populations of other species of wild oxen (Cox <em>et al. </em>1991, 1992; Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1994, 1999; Le Xuan Canh <em>et al. </em>1997; Duckworth and Hedges 1998; Evans <em>et al</em>. 2000; Cox <em>et al</em>. 1991, 1992; Le Xuan Canh <em>et al</em>. 1997). Numbers of wild oxen were, however, much higher in Cambodia, even though, within the vast extents of habitat, their densities were already low as documented during an aerial survey of a large part of eastern Cambodia in 1994 (Olivier and Woodford 1994).<br/><br/>The last published records of Koupreys are those of C. Wharton, who lead an expedition to capture Koupreys in 1963/64 (Wharton 1966). In 1969, J. Mellon saw two female Koupreys in the Chhep/Melouprey area of Cambodia, and in 1993 he was of the opinion that there might still be Koupreys in the area (J. Mellon <em>in litt</em> to D. Ashwell 1993). Later reports were also received by Pfeffer (1974 <em>in litt</em>. to IUCN/CMC). In the 1964-1970 period, Pfeffer undertook five expeditions to Indochina (each three months long) during which he collected information about kouprey and ""took the only reasonable photograph of a wild kouprey"" (Kemf 1988, Pfeffer and Ou Kim-San 1967, Pfeffer 1969). None of the evidence for Koupreys since Mellon's time, based on second-hand reports, hearsay, equivocal track identification or trophy horns (found in villages or wildlife markets and which could plausibly date back to Wharton's era) (e.g. MacKinnon and Stuart 1989, Duckworth and Hedges 1998, Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Timmins and Ou 2001, Timmins <em>et al</em>. 2003), has been particularly convincing in suggesting that viable populations of Koupreys remain; rather it suggests that a very rapid demise occurred. Wharton (1957) observed Koupreys to occur, even in what was considered optimal habitat, in lower numbers than Banteng&#160;<em>Bos javanicus</em> (his figures and other observations suggest a ratio of somewhere between 1:2 and 1:10), and suggested that, because of their restricted range and habitat specificity, Kouprey was at elevated risk of extinction compared with the other wild cattle.&#160;<br/><br/>Extensive survey work has now documented where significant wild cattle populations remain within the historical range of Kouprey, and in no area other than eastern Cambodia are wild cattle numbers high (Timmins and Ou 2001, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, AWCSG 2011). In most areas wild cattle numbers are so low (low dozens of individuals scattered through hundreds of square kilometres of habitat) that it is no longer conceivable that Kouprey could survive (Le Xuan Canh <em>et al</em>. 1997, Duckworth and Hedges 1998, Timmins and Ou 2001, Timmins <em>et al</em>. 2003, RJ. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). An assessment of 90% of camera trap photos from the region including the potential range of the Kouprey was made in 2011 (AWCSG 2011). Although Banteng, Wild Water Buffalo <em>Bubalus arnee</em>, and Gaur <em>Bos gaurus</em> were all recorded from the region, there were no camera trap images of Kouprey. A careful gap analysis of potential Kouprey sites was part of the first step of the study, but not all the relevant data could be examined. The majority of images from at least seven projects known to have captured wild cattle were not reviewed. This included two sets of photos from potentially important areas of eastern Cambodia. None of the landscapes assessed were sufficiently surveyed to rule out the presence of Kouprey, and for the foreseeable future, it will be impossible to identify every remaining individual wild ox to species in such areas. But there are no defensible grounds for considering the population of Kouprey to be anything other than negligible in such areas (single individuals or 2-3 animals), primarily because of the naturally lower densities of Kouprey compared with Banteng, the habitat specificity of Kouprey and its exceptional value in trade (Wharton 1957, Timmins and Ou 2001, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, AWCSG 2011).&#160;<br/><br/>In eastern Cambodia there has now been substantial survey work (including observation-based field surveys and camera-trapping) which has documented hundreds of both Banteng and Gaur and even small numbers of Wild Water Buffalo (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. based on WCS and WWF unpublished data; T. D. Evans and T. Clements pers. comm. 2008, Gray and Phan 2011, AWCSG 2011). This, in addition to suggesting Kouprey really has been hunted out, gives good numerical grounds to be confident that kouprey (historically the rarer species) no longer occurs in the ratio found by Wharton and that Kouprey declined significantly faster and was almost certainly less resilient to hunting than are the other species (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Certainly fewer than 5,000 wild cattle now survive within the historical range of Kouprey, 90% or more of those within Cambodia and the majority of those within the eastern provinces (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). If Kouprey still survives, it is certainly only as individuals (not functional groups) in very low numbers; its extinction, if not yet upon us, is almost certainly sealed. Therefore future recommendations focus on protection of areas with the highest probability of harbouring Kouprey that are also high priority sites for other wildlife species, and further review of camera trap photos; rather than further survey efforts (AWCSG 2011).",Decreasing,"The historical distribution of this species was Cambodia, southern Lao PDR, southeast Thailand, and western Viet Nam (Grubb 2005).&#160;However, there is no recent (post-1970) confirmation in any of these countries and because of the obvious major declines in all congeners in this region in this period, this species is now thought to be possibly extinct.<p></p>","Kouprey is probably extinct, but if it persists it faces opportunistic hunting whenever encountered.",Terrestrial,"This species is listed in CITES Appendix I, and is legally protected in all range states. If the species is still extant it is most likely to be in eastern Cambodia in one of four protected areas (Lomphat Wildlife Sanctuary, Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary, Mondulkiri Protection Forest and or Siema Biodiversity Conservation Area) (Timmins and Ou 2001, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, AWCSG 2011). There are no Kouprey in captivity, one existed in Vincennes Zoo, Paris, in 1937 and survived for about five years. There have been suggestions that domesticated Kouprey may survive in Cambodia (Hassanin <em>et al</em>. 2006). However this seems unlikely&#160;(R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008) and&#160; recent analysis of several nuclear genes revealed that a domesticated specimen was a hybrid between female Kouprey and male <em>Bos taurus</em>&#160;(Handschuh and Hassanin&#160;2013).&#160;<br/><br/>It is unlikely that specific survey work for Kouprey would produce any better evidence than has already been documented, and the best conservation measures for the species now would be to concentrate on <em>in situ</em> protection activities for large mammal communities in eastern Cambodia, especially building upon and strengthening the existing projects within the Srepok Wilderness Area of the Mondulkiri Protection Forest and the Siema Biodiversity Conservation Area (AWCSG 2011).",Indomalayan,last absolute confirmed date is 1969/70,true,false,Global
46363646,2891,Bos gaurus,Vulnerable,A2cd+3cd+4cd,2016,2016-05-25 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Gaur qualifies as Vulnerable under criterion A (VU A2cd+3cd+4cd). The population&#160;decline in parts of its range especially Indochina and Malaysia,&#160;perhaps also Myanmar and China, is likely to be well over 70% over the last&#160;three generations (generation length estimated at 8-10 years), whereas in India&#160;and Nepal the overall decline rate is considerably lower. This reflects that in&#160;the various reasonably well-protected areas, and a small number of animals in some non-protected areas where they are protected for cultural reasons, population trends are stable, and in a few areas which have been neglected but are the focus of improved&#160;protection, populations are rebuilding. Karanth <em>et al.</em> (2010) estimated average local extinction rates of Gaur distribution at 60% over past 50 years in India with the rates varying from 7% from reasonably protected habitats to a high of 98% from unprotected habitats. The global distribution of the Gaur has reduced by over 80% in past 100 years and Gaur is now mostly limited to habitats within protected areas (Groves and Grubb 2011). Weighting these by population size gives&#160;an overall decline of at least 30% over the last three generations. Similar&#160;reductions are projected, largely because the causative factors (especially wild&#160;meat hunting and hunting for the trade in horns in Southeast Asia, habitat loss and hunting for meat in South Asia) are still&#160;operative. Although the proportion of the global population which is in&#160;relatively well protected habitats in India is increasing, and thus the averaged global&#160;decline rate ought to decrease, an ongoing decline of 30% (in the next three generations) or more is adjudged likely. The recent history in Malaysia proves&#160;that directed Gaur poaching can induce rapid declines in regions previously&#160;judged relatively safe. Poaching in Malaysia is undertaken by international&#160;gangs and it is likely that once returns in Malaysia drop they will move to&#160;other countries, though there is no evidence for this yet; the patterns in other high-value species in more advanced&#160;declines (e.g. southeast Asian otters) indicate that incursion even to southern&#160;India is likely. The species could potentially qualify for Vulnerable under criterion C, although there are not enough quantitative data available.","The Gaur occurs from sea level up to at least 2,800 m asl (Wood 1937, Wharton 1968, Choudhury 2002). Despite the many reports that call it an animal of hill-country, low-lying areas seem to comprise optimal habitat (Choudhury 2002): in Conry’s (1989) study area, elevations ranged from 46 to 1,079 m asl but the three radio-tracked Gaur only used areas below 381 m. Elevations below 61 m were used most intensively and all three animals selected these low-lying areas; elevations above 61 m were selected against or used in proportion to availability (Conry 1989). Similarly, in the Tenasserim-Dawna mountains, Thailand, signs of Gaur were more abundant in the lowlands than in the hills, noting that this was the opposite of the patterns that would be predicted if hunting (itself concentrated heavily in the lowlands) was the chief determinant of population densities, although solitary animals were found mainly in the hills (Steinmetz <em>et al</em>. 2008). Schaller (1967) compared vegetation maps of India with the (mid-20th century) distribution of Gaur and concluded that the species was largely confined to evergreen, semi-evergreen, and moist deciduous forest but it also occurred in dry deciduous forest areas at the periphery of its range. He considered Gaur habitat to be ""characterized by (1) large, relatively undisturbed forest tracts, (2) hilly terrain below an altitude of 5,000 to 6,000 ft (1,500-1,800 m asl), (3) availability of water, and (4) an abundance of forage in the form of coarse grasses (including bamboo), shrubs, and trees"". However, He cautioned that the apparent preference of Gaur for hilly terrain may be partly due to the earlier conversion of most of the plains and other low lying areas to croplands and pastures. Kumar (2010) investigated factors influencing spatial distribution of Gaur abundance in Nagarahole-Bandipur reserves and observed that the Gaur abundance patterns were primarily determined by protection effectiveness, local levels of human disturbance and undulating terrain. He also observed that these ecological and anthropogenic factors induced variation in local abundance from less than 1 per km² to about 50 animals per km² (Kumar 2010). Similarly, Wharton (1968) concluded that Gaur appeared to avoid evergreen rainforest, ""preferring foothill tracts of sub-humid or deciduous forest adjacent to savannah forest, glades or other open terrain affected by man and fire thus co-existing with and exploiting low human populations in hill zones with moderate to heavy rainfall"". Throughout the range of Gaur, habitat destruction and human presence is usually higher in lowlands than in hills, meaning that differential human pressures may have caused the apparent preference of Gaur for hills. Gaur occurs in many forest types in Lao PDR, Viet Nam and Cambodia including truly evergreen and montane forest, but populations in closed canopy forests especially those at higher elevations might naturally be at much lower densities than those in lowland areas with a mosaic of open and closed forest types, and in closed canopy forests areas the species appears to frequent grassy openings (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Greiser Johns 2000, Duckworth and Hedges 1998, Timmins and Ou 2001, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Although no significant difference was found in overall Gaur densities in moist compared with dry deciduous forests in Nagarahole, India (Karanth and Sunquist 1992), local variation in Gaur densities ranged between less than 1 per km² to more than 45 per km² in Nagarahole and Bandipur reserves due to variation in local habitat factors conducive for Gaurs (Kumar 2010). Steinmetz et al. (in prep.) considered that Gaur herds in an expanding population were consistently concentrated in mixed deciduous forest rather than semi-evergreen forest, although the total area of study, that was safe from poaching, was only 20 km². <br/><br/>Gaur can persist in fragmented areas with some habitat disturbance and hunting, including in landscapes dominated by plantations (such as on parts of the Valparai plateau, south India), but in Southeast Asia it has been too heavily hunted in such areas to survive in them. Gaur can better tolerate rugged terrain and denser forest than other wild and domestic cattle, provided that there are adequate water sources (Kumar 2010, Smith and Xie Yan 2008). In Thailand it uses former cultivation amid forest, and populations in such areas can recover well if not hunted (Anak Pattanavipool pers. comm. 2006, R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2006). A study of coffee estates around Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary, India, recorded Gaur only in those coffee areas within 1 km of the Sanctuary’s boundary (Bali <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>Gaur both grazes and browses, reportedly eating mostly young green grasses but also leaves, fruit, twigs, and bark of various woody species, as well as coarse dry grasses, and bamboo. It seems able to maintain good condition on relatively low quality feed. At least 180-190 species of plants have been recorded in the diet (Kumar 2010). More information is given about Gaur’s diet in Dunbar Brander (1923), Hubback (1937), Schaller (1967), Wharton (1968), Krishnan (1972), Khan (1973), Conry (1981), Ebil Yusof (1982), Ramachandran <em>et al</em>. (1986), Prayurasiddhi and Smith (1993) and Sankar <em>et </em>al. (2000). Captive Gaur are reported to eat about 20 kg of green fodder per day (Ramachandran et al. 1986). During the cool season (November-February) the Gaur that Schaller (1967) studied in central India ate various herbs, large quantities of the leaves and seeds of bamboo, various other grasses, and the leaves of a number of tree species; but by the beginning of the hot season (March-June) coarse dry and semi-dry grasses made up the bulk of their diet, averaging 85% by volume (range 66-100%; four rumen samples), with browse only making up about 10%. Gaur also feeds on crops including corn, cassava, and young rubber trees, sometimes causing great damage (Wharton 1968, National Research Council 1983). Schaller (1967) reported that Gaur in Kanha National Park drank at least once per day during the hot season, usually in the evening. The mean annual group size of re-introduced Gaur in Bhandhavgarh Tiger Reserve, was estimated at 7.3 ± 0.76 (SE). The overall estimated summer, monsoon and winter home ranges of gaur were 290 km², 137 km² and 155 km² (Minimum Convex Polygon) respectively. The overall individual male home ranges varied from 135 to 142 km2, and overall individual female home ranges varied from 32 to 169 km2. In summer, Gaur largely preferred grassland (P&lt;0.0001), whereas in monsoon and winter, Gaur preferred bamboo mixed forest (P&lt;0.0001). Gaur avoided open mixed forest (P&lt;0.0001) and agricultural land in all three seasons. In total, Gaur fed on 68 plant species (Sankar <em>et al </em>2013). Sahai (1972) stated that Gaur drink at least twice in a 24-hour period but there appears to be no fixed time for drinking. In undisturbed areas, Gaur is mainly diurnal, but in areas of high human disturbance, it is reported to become mainly nocturnal.<br/><br/>The basic social group appears to be a female-juvenile unit with larger groups tending to be more-or-less temporary assemblages (as in the other large species of Asian Bovini). Maternal herds containing several adult cows, juveniles, and calves frequently occur but their composition is somewhat fluid, particularly during the rut; these herds can often contain several subadult and adult males. The number of bulls in a herd changes with the time of year. Mature males associate with cows primarily during the rut: during Schaller’s study in Kanha National Park 65% of herds were accompanied by a mature male during April (the peak of the rut) but during the second half of the year the proportion dropped to 31% (Schaller 1967). Neither Schaller (1967) nor Sahai (1972) found any evidence to support Powell’s (1964) statement that young bulls usually live apart from the maternal herds; nor did Schaller’s observations support Dunbar Brander’s (1923) statement that the ’master bull’ drives all other males from the herd. Males not associating with mixed herds either live in all-male groups or are solitary. The bull herds are generally unstable, although sometimes two or more animals may frequently associate. The typical herd size appears to be in the range of 5-12 animals and herds are rarely larger than 20 (Dunbar Brander 1923, Hubback 1937, Hislop 1961a, Schaller 1967, Prater 1971, Sahai 1972, Pal and Guin 1986). Large groups of 20, 40, or even 100 animals are probably temporary aggregations of smaller groups (Pal and Guin 1986).<br/><br/>The majority of the 125-150 Gaur studied by Schaller (1967) in Kanha National Park (India) ranged over an area of at least 78 km²; and the herds he studied travelled on average 2-3 miles (3.2-4.8 km) a day, although on occasion the distance could be much less. In West Malaysia Gaur home ranges have been estimated to be: approximately 13 km² (the Kuala Tahan herd in Taman Negara National Park) (Weigum 1972); and 29.9 km² for a yearling male, 52.1 km² for a yearling female, and 137.3 km² for an adult male in Pahang (Conry 1989). The large differences between the two studies probably reflect the different methods employed by the two workers (see Conry 1989: 60). Home ranges that can be as large as 137 km² hinder the setting aside of conservation areas for Gaur, particularly as Gaur often occurs in those areas where the pressures for economic development are highest.<br/><br/>In central India, most Gaur mate in December and January, and calves are born in August and September according to Dunbar Brander (1923); Stebbing (1911) and Sanderson (1912) generally agreed with Dunbar Brander but noted that calves may also be born in April, May, and June. In Kanha National Park (central India) Schaller (1967) recorded rutting bulls from December to June, with an apparent peak of sexual behaviour in March and April; however, the occurrence of a few new-born animals throughout the year indicated that some mating must occur in every month. In southern India the majority of matings reportedly take place between November and March (Morris 1937). In Cambodia the majority of Gaur births occur in December and January (Wharton 1957). In Myanmar, calves are born throughout the year (Evans 1912, Peacock 1933); and in West Malaysia young Gaur are seen in all months except October to December (Hubback 1937).<br/><br/>The gestation period of Gaur is reported to be nine months by Hubback (1937) and Crandall (1964) and 270 days, ‘a little shorter than for Banteng or domestic cattle and longer than for yak and Kouprey’, by National Research Council (1983: 49). Only one calf is born to a cow per pregnancy; there are no records of twins (Hubback 1937, Schaller 1967). Females probably first mate when about two years old and thus have their first calf at three years old (Schaller 1967). If the food supply is favourable, most adult females probably calve every year. In Kanha National Park, approximately 90% of adult cows bore young during a year but calf mortality was high, with about 50% of the calves dying before reaching one year old; the main cause of death was predation by Tigers (<em>Panthera tigris</em>) (Schaller 1967).<br/><br/>Rarely, bulls kill each other when fighting, and occasionally they are severely injured while fighting. Predation is by far the major cause of Gaur mortality, perhaps followed by disease (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). For example in Bandipur, Gaur is the most important prey in terms of the biomass taken by Tiger (42%) and Leopard Panthera pardus (15%) (Andheria <em>et al</em>. 2007). In Bandipur, Gaur remains were found in about 24% of Tiger faeces and 9% of Leopard faeces (Andheria <em>et al</em>. 2007). In adjoining Nagarahole, the proportion of Gaur in Tiger’s diet was about 45% in kills, 17% in scats (Karanth and Sunquist 1995). In Tadoba-Andhari, Gaur together with Sambar contributed to nearly 70% of the prey biomass consumed by Tiger, whereas in Pench-Maharashtra it was 80% (Karanth and Kumar 2005). In well protected forest reserves where different body-sized ungulates are abundantly available, Gaur is selectively predated by Tiger (Karanth and Sunquist 1995).","The set of threats and the gravity of each threat to Gaur differs greatly between south and central India, and Southeast Asia; China and most of northeast India are more similar to Southeast Asia in this respect (Farshid Ahrestani pers. comm. 2008), and are so treated in the following discussion.<br/><br/>In Indochina, Myanmar, and northeast India, hunting is the major problem, compounded by loss of suitable habitat: large tracts of suitable habitat hold few or no Guar. Ongoing habitat degradation and conversion is continually reducing the potential population, should hunting be brought under control (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Duckworth and Hedges 1998, Timmins and Ou 2001, Choudhury 2002, Steinmetz 2004, Than Zaw pers. comm. 2006, R.J Timmins pers. comm. 2008, F. Ahrestani pers. comm. 2008). Hunting is often for meat and a variety of methods are used (Choudhury 2002). There is also a flourishing international trade in Gaur parts, both horns (decorative) and internal organs (for medicinal purposes). Given the small size of the remaining Southeast Asian subpopulations and the number of trophies found for sale in Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand, and Myanmar during essentially opportunistic surveys, trade is clearly a major threat (Srikosamatara <em>et al</em>. 1992; Baird 1993; Srikosamatara and Suteethorn 1994, 1995; Martin and Phipps 1996; Srifa La-Ong <em>et al</em>. 1997; Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999). The most important population in Cambodia is scattered through a forest landscape that encompasses four provinces (Mondulkiri, Kratie, Stung Treng and Ratanakiri) and five conservation areas (Lomphat Wildlife Sanctuary, Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary, Siema Biodiversity Conservation Area, Mondulkiri Protection Forest (including the Srepok Wilderness area) and Phnom Nam Lyr Wildlife Sanctuary). Hunting is still rife in much of this area, and forest fragmentation is rapidly accelerating with human population immigration, infrastructural developments (especially roads), commercial agricultural expansion, economic land speculation and mineral extraction. However, although perhaps less than 20% of this area is well protected from the aforementioned threats and protected area management is only close to effective in two areas, the most significant constraint to the area’s Gaur is the long-term uncertainty of continuation of effective conservation management of the Srepok Wilderness Area and Siema Biodiversity Conservation Area. Although conservation efforts for Gaur and many other species are, in both these areas, extremely encouraging, both face an uncertain future with the possibility of degazettement of conservation status of parts of them, the possible loss of adequate external funding necessary to maintain high standards of management, the possible loss of political support necessary to uphold high protection standards and the uncertainties of maintaining a motivated well trained staff. Almost throughout Southeast Asia, protected areas are not yet stalling declines in mammals with commercial value, such as Gaur. Areas with stabilized populations (in addition to the two Cambodian areas, perhaps only a few areas in Thailand (see Population) and Cat Tien National Park in Viet Nam) are exceptional (R. Steimetz pers. comm. 2008, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>Surprisingly, given its retention of healthy populations of other high-value very large mammals (Tiger and Asian Elephant (<em>Elephas maximus</em>); Lynam <em>et al</em>. 2007; S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008 for elephants), Malaysia has among the most rapidly declining populations of Gaur. This reflects targeted hunting for large mammals of high commercial value, even within protected areas (Abdul Kadir 1998, Wan Shahruddin 1998, Lynam 1999, DWNP/Danced 2002, Lynam <em>et al</em>. 2007). Given the rapid decline within the 1990s and the lack of information traced since 2002, the exact current situation of Gaur in Malaysia is unclear. Kemasul Forest Reserve, where the species was found in Laidlaw’s (2000) survey of virgin jungle reserves, probably no longer exists as such. Even at the time of survey, most of the Forest Reserve was due to be converted into an <em>Acacia mangium</em> plantation, although still nominally a Forest Reserve. Kemasul was, long ago, part of a massive block of lowland forest which included the famous Jengka Triangle and Krau ""Game"" Reserve. Only Krau remains, albeit much reduced (R. Dunlop pers. comm. 2008). Even Krau, which was set up (in 1923) principally for the protection of Gaur, numerous in the area then, faces multiple threats (R. Dunlop pers. comm. 2008). In the surveys for DWNP/DANCED (2002), evidence of hunting, including cartridges, was found within the reserve, particularly in the easily accessible lowland areas; there were plenty of hunting stories by and about all of the different local communities, without exception, although their preferred target species differed. Conversion from natural forest to other land-uses of adjacent state-land combined with new ease of access has undoubtedly made Krau more of a focal point for such activity. There is a new (metalled) road and land conversion right up to the boundaries, facilitating access and easing the use of hunting methods such as spotlighting, as well as reducing habitat. The salt licks (for which Krau used to be famous) increasingly fall outside the forest (reflecting shrinking reserve boundaries and farmland encroachment into the reserve) and are now mostly in zones of high human activity of one sort or another. Temporary grasslands generated through traditional indigenous farming, which were often fairly difficult to get to and thus relatively free from hunting, were previously important Gaur habitat. A forester who used to work in Malaysia in the 1940s said that Gaur herds used to follow the Orang Asli settlements, moving in when they moved out, and Weigum (1972) even recommended ""...to maintain herds in the park it is recommended that 45 acres of land be clear-cut preferably in 15 acre plots ½ mile apart and be recut every three years"". Gaur meat is, or at least was being, sold at restaurants in placed like Cameron and Grik.<br/><br/>In south and central India, densities are likely to be widely below ecological carrying capacity, through hunting and competition with domestic livestock, although this conclusion is based on rather few empirical studies and there are some outstanding populations in well-secured protected areas. Substantial declines and local extinctions of Gaur were driven by hunting (for meat), competition with livestock, and habitat conversion, particularly during the first half of the twentieth century, resulting in a drastically reduced and fragmented distributional range, especially outside the protected area network (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). Hunting is much less prevalent than in Southeast Asia, reflecting the general enforcement of wildlife protection laws (Farshid Ahrestani pers. comm. 2008). Nonetheless, even in high-profile reserves, it is still suppressing densities significantly. For example, densities in Bhadra Tiger Reserve are very low, because of poaching, by comparison with what the habitat should support (Jathanna <em>et al</em>. 2003), and the measured density in a heavily hunted area of Nagarahole National Park was only a third of that in a well secured area (Madhusudan and Karanth 2002). Even though all hunting is illegal in this protected area, preventive measures are uneven across it, and Gaur is still poached, at least sporadically, wherever protection effectiveness is low (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). Gaur, has reportedly been exterminated from three Indian protected areas, Thattekad Wildlife Sanctuary (Kerala), Bhandhavgarh (Madhya Pradesh) and Kanger Valley National Park (Madhya Pradesh) (Pasha <em>et al</em>. 2004). Interaction with domestic stock is greatly under-appreciated as a threat to Gaur, but is probably the main factor which currently limits populations in south and central India: livestock are widely grazed even in otherwise well-managed protected areas. Mean densities of Gaur were fully 132 times higher in livestock-free areas than in adjacent livestock-grazed areas of Bandipur, and in shared grazing areas Gaur densities declined sharply with increasing livestock densities; in the grazed area studied, halving the livestock density allowed increases of Gaur by a factor of 57 (Madhusudan 2004). Threats to southern India’s forest ungulates by competition with domestic stock grazing within protected areas are exacerbated where dung is collected for export to adjacent coffee areas. Fuel wood removal may also be at levels sufficient to disrupt nutrient cycles of the habitat (Madhusudan 2005). Many Indian forest areas are severely encroached by exotics such as <em>Lantana camara</em>, <em>Parthenium</em> spp. and <em>Chromolaena odorata</em>, and these are suspected to effect major changes to forest structure (Hiremath and Sundaram 2005): but the effects of these on Gaur populations warrant further study. Killing of Gaur in retaliation to crop damage (through consumption and trampling) occurs, but is of limited significance to conservation (Choudhury 2002, Farshid Ahrestani pers. comm. 2008). Some animals also die from ingestion of agrochemicals, and human response when wandering into farmland and villages; these could be significant for already isolated and reduced populations (Choudhury 2002).<br/><br/>Throughout the range, diseases, particularly rinderpest and foot-and-mouth disease, transmitted by domestic cattle are a potentially serious threat. Foot-and-mouth is the most frequent, but rinderpest has had a particularly dramatic impact in India and several sub-populations of Gaur were nearly destroyed as a result of the disease in 1968 (Krishnan 1972, Pal and Guin 1986, Choudhury 2002), while in Bhadra, it nearly wiped out Gaur populations in 1988–1989, when nearly 800 individuals died (Girish D.V. pers. comm. 2008). In north and central Myanmar anthrax was a major factor in the decline of the species (Salter 1983). Pasha <em>et al</em>. (2004) considered that “in fact no wild animal in India [is] so profoundly influenced by transmitted infections from domestic livestock as Gaur”. There is little research or other evidence to determine impacts of introgression with domestic oxen on Gaur populations, although such factors might be expected to be most serious in India, given the wide overlap of domestic stock with Gaur. Farshid Ahrestani (pers. comm. 2008) saw a Gaur herd of 20 individuals far from human habitation with one domestic ox in the Palni Hills, so it seems likely that introgression occurs to at least some extent.<br/><br/>Srikosamtara and Suteethorn (1995) drew attention to the pressing threats facing Gaur, placing it in the same league of trade-driven threat as better-known species such as Tiger and Asian Elephant, and emphasising the international dimension of trade. Subsequently, the population collapse in Malaysia seems to have been driven by hunting teams from Lao PDR and Thailand (as proven by language at hunting camps in Temenggor), co-opting local Malaysian associates (A.J. Lynam pers. comm. 2008). It is reasonable to expect that when returns in Malaysia drop (as they probably have done already) these teams may turn their attention to other countries’ Gaur populations.","The global population is estimated to lie within 15,000-35,000 animals. Field data suggest that the proportion of mature individuals in the population is likely to be 0.4-0.6, indicating a total of 6,000-21,000 mature individuals, with fewer than 10 populations estimated to have over 1,000 individuals. Most population figures given for numbers of Gaur are little more than guesses.<br/><br/>In Bangladesh, Gaur is probably extinct (Md Anwarul Islam in litt. 2008). A few were thought still to occur in the Chittagong, Chittagong Hill Tracts, Sylhet, and Mymensingh areas in the early 1980s (Sarker and Sarker 1984), but none had been seen in Pablakhali Wildlife Sanctuary in the Hill Tracts since the early 1970s (Khan 1985). Choudhury (2002) stated that Gaur individuals from Mizoram and Tripura (India) still cross into Bangladesh, although the records on which this was based were not given. In Bhutan, Gaur apparently persists all over the southern foot-hill zone, notably in Royal Manas National Park, Phipsoo Wildlife Sanctuary and Khaling Wildlife Sanctuary (Choudhury 2002).<br/><br/>In Cambodia, Gaur must have declined substantially, almost certainly by well over 50% in the period from the late 1960s to the early 1990s. However, they remained widespread, outside the lower Mekong and Tonle Sap lowlands, with large populations in some areas, although in generally low numbers overall (Heng Kimchhay <em>et al</em>. 1998, Daltry and Momberg 2000, Timmins and Ou 2001, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2013). From the 1990s to the present almost certainly the rate of decline increased. By far the most substantial Gaur population of the country remained in eastern Cambodia centred on Mondulkiri province, where in the late 1990s potentially several hundred to a thousand may have survived in a forested landscape of over 15,000 km²; other significant populations probably numbering in the low 100s also remained in several other areas including Virachey National Park and adjacent forests, the northern plains including Preah Vihear Protection Forest and Kulen Promtep Wildlife Sanctuary, the Prey Long area of the central plains and the Cardamom Mountains (Timmins and Ou 2001, Tordoff <em>et al</em>. 2005, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2013). With increasing national stability and economic growth further declines probably of the order of 50% or more, but more importantly an almost certainly accelerating rate of decline, took place from the early 1990s to the present (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2013). As of 2013 the most significant population by far in Cambodia still remained within Mondulkiri Province (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2013 based on WCS and WWF unpublished data; T. Clements pers. comm. 2007; T.D. Evans pers. comm. 2007; Gray 2012). Protection efforts in part of this landscape between 2005 and 2013 have probably stabilised the population there (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2013 based on WCS and WWF unpublished data; T. Clements pers. comm. 2007; T.D. Evans pers. comm. 2007). However increasing pressures, including an upsurge of snaring and wild-meat demand from Vietnam, since approximately 2015 mean this protection is now not sufficient and Gaur populations are likely declining. Distance-based line transects in the landscape fail to detect sufficient Gaur (<em>c.f.</em> Banteng) to robustly estimate population size (T. Gray pers. comm). Protection outside these two areas is limited and for Cambodia as a whole the trend is still a significant decrease (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2013).<br/><br/>In China, Gaur occurs in Yunnan and southeast Tibet (Ma Yiqing and Wang Yingxiang 1995). Up until the 1950s–1960s, all sites in Yunnan (except Yingjiang) formed one large contiguous population, but this is now heavily fragmented. By the 1980s, the species was extinct in Lancang county, and the remaining animals were split into two populations: Xishuangbanna-Simao and Cangyuan (Wang Yingxiang verbally 1998 to Duckworth and Hedges 1998). Some sources suggest that a population of 600-800 existed in Yunnan Province in the mid-1990s, with the majority occurring in Xishuangbanna National Nature Reserve (Ma Yiqing and Wang Yingxiang 1995); other sources suggest that only small numbers of Gaur remain in Yunnan (along the border with Myanmar) and that hunting had led to the local extinction of Gaur in Xishuangbanna (Xiang and Santiapillai 1993).<br/><br/>In India, four major (Western Ghats, Eastern Ghats, Central India and North-East) and two minor (Bihar and West Bengal) priority ‘Gaur conservation areas’ have been identified, reflecting the remaining distribution (Sankar <em>et al</em>. 2000, Choudhury 2002). The Western Ghats and their outflanking hills in south India constitute one of the most extensive extant strongholds of Gaur, with good numbers in Wynaad - Nagarahole – Mudumalai - Bandipur complex (Ranjitsinh 1997, Ahrestani and Karanth 2014). Recent distributional assessment surveys in the Karnataka part of the Western Ghats showed the presence of Gaur in more than 60% of the 22,000 km² landscape (K.U. Karanth and N.S. Kumar unpublished data). Ranjitsinh (1997) estimated 12,000-22,000 Gaur in India, while Choudhury (2002) suggested that there were about 23,000-34,000 Gaur in India, Bhutan, and Bangladesh; but the true number is simply not known, as shown by the wide ranges. Reliable figures on Gaur population densities are rare because of the huge effort required to sample these low-density populations in dense forested areas (Ahrestani and Karanth 2014). Major populations have been reported in Nagarahole National Park (probably over 3,000; 5.1 per 100 km²; Ahrestani and Karanth 2014), Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary (over 1000; 3 per 100 km²; Karanth 2014), Melghat Tiger Reserve (perhaps 1000; 1 per 100 km²; Karanth and Kumar 2005), Bandipur National Park (over 4,000; 5.3 per 100 km²; Ahrestani and Karanth 2014), Mudumalai Tiger Reserve and adjoining areas (over 1,500 individuals) Kanha National Park (probably around 4000; Jhala <em>et al</em>. 2015), Pench Tiger Reserve, Madhya Pradesh (0.7 per 100 km²; Karanth and Nichols 2000) and Maharashtra (0.8 per 100 km² ,Karanth and Kumar 2005) (perhaps &gt;500 individuals), Bhandhavgarh Tiger Reserve (re-introduced population, 65 individuals), Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (over 1,300; 1.8 per 100 km²; Karanth and Kumar 2005), Periyar Tiger Reserve and adjoining forest complex (500-1,000), Annamalai range complex (Parambikulum, Valparai, and Grass Hills) (500-700), Silent Valley and adjoining forest complex (500-1,000), Agastyamalai forest complex (about 500), Biligirirangangswamy Wildlife Sanctuary (2.8 per 100 km²; Karanth 2013) and Cauvery-Malemahadeswara Hill range (0.2 to 0.7 per 100 km²; Rayar 2010) (together over 1500), Anshi-Dandeli Tiger Reserve and adjoining forest mosaic (perhaps about 700; 1 per 100 km²; Karanth 2014), Kudremukh National Park and its adjoining forest complex including Someshwara and Mookambika Wildlife Sanctuaries (&gt;600), Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary (&gt;1,200 individuals; 4.4 per 100 km²; Karanth and Kumar 2015); Satpura Tiger Reserve (&gt;1,000; 1.6 per 100 km²; Jhala <em>et al</em>. 2015). Many other areas are known or suspected to hold small populations, but in many sites such small numbers are unlikely to be viable (Choudhury 2002). For example, small populations of unknown size exist in Radhanagari Wildlife Sanctuary and Manas Sanctuary. Most of the foregoing figures are based on rigorous line transect survey methods. In recent years Gaur has reportedly been exterminated from three protected areas, Thattekad Wildlife Sanctuary (Kerala), Bhandhavgarh (Madhya Pradesh) and Kanger Valley National Park (Madhya Pradesh) (Pasha <em>et al</em>. 2004). Information on population status from the states of Andhra Pradesh (probably over 300 individuals), Orissa and North-East is limited (Choudhury 2002); there are demonstrably very few Gaur in Kaziranga (Karanth and Nichols 2000). Gaur populations are known to fluctuate annually even in well-protected reserves such as Nagarahole and Bandipur (Karanth and Kumar unpub. data) due to a variety of reasons (disease outbreak, seasonal movement patterns etc). No densities could be estimated, despite the use of suitable survey methodology, at Kanha or Namdapha, implying relatively low populations, and none was found during such surveys at Kaziranga or Ranthambore (Karanth and Nichols 2000); only small numbers persist in Kaziranga (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). In Trishna Wildlife Sanctuary, Tripura, North East India, the estimated population of Gaur is &lt;50 individuals with estimated density as 1.5 individuals/km² (Dasgupta <em>et al</em>. 2008). The Bhadra density is low, reflecting poaching (using snares, dogs and shotguns) and livestock grazing. However, the Gaur population there is now steadily increasing with successful conservation interventions (K.U. Karanth and N.S. Kumar&#160; unpublished data). A study at Nagarahole National Park compared the fauna of an area which was only moderately hunted with a heavily hunted site: this found respective densities of six and two Gaurs per km² (Madhusudan and Karanth 2002).<br/><br/>In Lao PDR, Byers <em>et al</em>. (1995) stated that the national population was approximately 1,000. This number is possible (field records exist from many areas), but animals would have been widely dispersed and at very low density in the extensive forest tracts across the country, with perhaps fewer than six sites holding more than 50 animals (Duckworth and Hedges 1998, Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Steinmetz 2004, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). A large population of Gaur was found in Nakai-Nam Theun NPA and the adjoining Nakai Plateau in the mid 1990s, when signs were readily found and even the animals themselves seen directly (Duckworth 1998, Duckworth and Hedges 1998, Evans <em>et al</em>. 2000). Resurveys of both areas, although using comparable methodology only on the plateau, indicate massive declines in the subsequent decade, with, for example, fairly intensive camera-trapping not recording the species at all, although small numbers persist in localised areas of the interior (Dersu 2007; Johnson and Johnston 2007, C. Coudrat and Chanthavy Vongkhamheng in litt. to R.J. Timmins 2013). The last decade has seen major reductions (in general, probably of well over 50%), in many large mammal populations across Lao PDR and it is now likely that many of the populations listed in Duckworth and Hedges (1998) have become locally extinct (Timmins and Robichaud 2005; R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). In addition to Nakai Nam Theun NBCA, two other protected area, Nam Et–Phou Loey and Nam Kading National Biodiversity Conservation Areas have been relatively well surveyed (although not specifically for wild cattle) with disappointing results suggesting very small remnant Gaur populations, another area Xe Sap NBCA appears to retain a small but more substantial population, while a fourth area, Xe Pian NBCA, along the border with Cambodia (mainly in Champasak Province) may also have a more substantial population, but data are scarce (BirdLife International Cambodia Programme 2012, Timmins 2012, unpub. data collected for AWCSG-GWC 2011, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2013, Akchousan Rasphone, J. Goodrich, C. Hallam and A. McWilliam in litt. to R.J. Timmins 2013). These five areas amount to the majority of the largest forest blocks remaining in Laos, with few other areas capable of supporting significant Gaur populations, but as of the end of 2013 it is likely that the most significant Gaur population survives in the extreme south of Lao along the border with Cambodia, particularly within Attapu province adjacent to the Virachey National Park area, in areas that remain poorly surveyed and not formally protected at the national level (unpub. data collected for AWCSG-GWC 2011, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2013).<br/><br/>In Malaysia, in 1994 the population was stated to be less than 500 individuals and it was thought to be declining (J. Brennan pers. comm. to Read <em>et al</em>. 1994; a number of other stated numbers from around that time, all of the same general order of a few hundred, and none derived allowing a quantification of error margin, are presented in Hedges in prep.), with then confirmed records from various sites, e.g., the Sungai Singgor area of Temenggor Forest Reserve, Hulu Perak (Ratnam <em>et al</em>. 1995). In the subsequent few years, the population collapsed, despite optimism through relatively stronger control of guns in Malaysia than elsewhere on the southeast Asian mainland, and a perception (e.g., Nash 1993) of relatively strict control of wildlife trade in Malaysia. Densities in Taman Negara were crudely estimated from surveys during 1999-2001 as 0, 3 and 22 Gaurs per 100 km² in three study sites (Kawanishi and Sunquist 2004). Although these authors adjudged large mammal poaching to be negligible in Taman Negara, high levels were confirmed there by Wan Shahruddin (1998) and camera-trapping (suitable in methodology and intensity to find Gaur if any significant numbers were present) did not record Gaur at a fourth sector of Taman Negara in 1999 (Lynam <em>et al</em>. 2007). In 2015, camera-trapping work done by MYCAT in south-western Taman Negara corridor (outside the park) showed the existence of Gaur. How many animals were not ascertained. Also camera-trap of individuals and prints were seen in Taman Negara, the wildlife corridor as well as in the contiguous forest adjoining it (M.T. Gumal pers. comm 2016). No Gaur was photographed at all in eight other potential Tiger areas surveyed by Lynam <em>et al</em>. (2007) during 1997-1999, including Temenggor (see Ratnam <em>et al</em>. 1995); because these were selected as the areas most likely to support Tigers and as Tiger-oriented camera-trapping elsewhere in South-east Asia usually yields photographs of Gaur, this study proves that only very low numbers of Gaur remain in Malaysia, no doubt way below the estimate in Read et al. (1994). However WWF Malaysia does have records of Gaur still existing in Belum-Temenggor (M.T. Gumal pers. comm. 2016). Further supporting this,none was found in the Jerangau Forest Reserve, from which it was suspected to have been eradicated by hunting (Azlan 2006). Gaur was found in only two of 14 sites (seven virgin jungle reserves and seven adjacent logged areas), making it among the most localised mammal species which was detected in a study assessing the importance of virgin jungle reserves. The two occupied sites were a contiguous pair in each management class, and among the biggest sites surveyed (over 100 km²); the virgin jungle reserves themselves rarely exceed 3 km² (Laidlaw 2000). Also the Endau-Rompin landscape has been camera trapped between 2008 to 2015, and with 231 camera-trap stations and found no signs of Gaur (an effective camera trapping area of 4,179 km²) (M.T. Gumal pers. comm 2016).<br/><br/>In the 1960s, there were estimated to be approximately 40 Gaur in Krau Wildlife Reserve, a figure deemed optimistic at the time; in the 1980s there were thought to be 22-31; in 1995 the estimate was only seven. When surveying the reserve in 2000 (see DWNP/DANCED 2002), R. Dunlop (pers. comm. 2008) covered the whole reserve (about 440 km²) with camera-traps in 119 one km-grid squares. Out of a total of 6,918 periods of 24-hour trapping, 61 species were recorded in 1,804 photographs of wildlife, yet only one photograph was of a Gaur. In almost 100 days of field searching for signs, Gaur tracks were recorded only on eight days, on each occasion as prints of isolated animals. The photograph, the sole sighting, and the eight track records were all in the south-east lowland area of the reserve, moving between an area of salt-licks and grazing just outside the reserve. This survey corroborated the 1995 estimate of seven animals, and the 2000-2001 figure could be even lower. Sumatran Rhinoceros (<em>Dicerorhinus sumatrensis</em>) and Asian Elephant (<em>Elephas maximus</em>) have both disappeared from Krau, and Gaur may be the next species to go. R. Dunlop (pers. comm. 2008) considers there no reason to expect this recent history not to typify that of Gaur populations at all sites in Malaysia. There are very recent records from: Tanjong Mentong in Taman Negara, where tracks were found during elephant surveys in late 2006 (Nurul Huda, WCS Malaysia pers. comm. 2008); Belum, in 2007, where animals were camera-trapped at salt-licks several times, including a herd of seven (Ahmad Zafir, WWF Malaysia pers. comm. 2008); and Temenggor, where individual animals (no herds) were camera-trapped nine times (never at salt licks, always on logging roads) in 2,364 trap-nights in 25 locations (Mark Darmaraj, WWF Malaysia pers. comm. 2008). A recent camera trapping study of fruiting gardens, which conducted 1024 camera trap nights at 15 sites within Krau, found no sign of Gaur (Moore <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>In Myanmar, the status of Gaur is poorly known (J.W. Duckworth and Than Zaw pers. comm. 2006). A March 1994 survey of Taminthi Wildlife Sanctuary, Myanmar's largest protected area, guessed that 100-200 Gaur remained, and that they were in danger of being extirpated from the area if current levels of poaching continued (Rabinowitz <em>et al</em>. 1995). A national Tiger survey camera-trapped Gaur in 11 of 15 camera-trapped sites, commonly in several (Lynam 2003); these sites were selected for their chances of holding Tigers, so, because the two species face similar threats, it may present the most positive picture of Gaur occurrence in the country.<br/><br/>In Nepal, the Gaur population was estimated to be 250-350 in the mid-1990s, with the majority in Chitwan National Park and Parsa Wildlife Reserve; a few other areas hold small numbers (Choudhury 2002). In total the population of this species is more or less stable, with some annual fluctuations. A 2008 census in Parsa Wildlife Reserve counted up to 37 Gaur, in 2011 a combined survey of Parsa Wildlife Reserve and Chitwan National Park counted 21 and 312 respectively. In 2013, Parsa Wildlife Reserve showed a total of 69 animals, a marked increase from the last count. The Gaur population found in east Nepal mainly confined to Trijuga forest, Udayapur District has been nearly extirpated. Currently national count is being held and it is expected that the numbers will be higher than previous years. The rough estimate is around 400 in Nepal.<br/><br/>In Thailand, an estimated total of 920 Gaur remained in 1994. Only 6-7 populations were thought to contain 50 or more animals and there were no Gaur outside protected areas. The most important protected areas for Gaur were Khao Yai National Park, Tap Lan National Park and Pang Sida National Park, Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary, Thung Yai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuary, Kaeng Krachan National Park and Mae Nam Phachi Wildlife Sanctuary, the Khlong Nakha complex, and possibly Om Koi and Mae Tuen Wildlife Sanctuaries. Even in protected areas with much suitable habitat Gaur densities were very low, for example in Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary the population density was less than 50% of the estimated carrying capacity of the area (Srikosamatara and Suteethorn 1995, S. Hedges pers. comm. 2000). Gaur populations are probably now increasing in several sites in Thailand, notably in Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary and Thung Yai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuary, with effective tackling of poaching. In Thung Yai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuary, sign monitoring in one small area (20 km²) over six years since poaching absolutely ceased indicated an annual population growth rate there of 0.31, although the relative contributions of birth and immigration could not be distinguished. Breeding herds became much more common, compared with the situation 10-15 years previously at the height of poaching (Steinmetz <em>et al</em>. 2009). In the Khao Paeng Ma reforestation site adjacent to Khao Yai National Park the population apparently expanded from two to 100 Gaur in less than 10 years, initially reflecting recolonization but apparently mostly from reproduction among animals at the site, all within a 10 km² area of secondary forest. The population stabilized at about 100 animals during 2004â€“2007 (based on counts from hilltops). As the forest grows and browse and grass diminish, reproduction is likely to decline (R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2008). This herd has flourished only by dint of the provision of 24-hour security (A.J. Lynam pers. comm. 2008). Numbers also seem to be expanding rapidly in Kuiburi National Park in southern Thailand, again from an artificially lowered population and again within a secondary forest area adjacent to semi-evergreen forest. In early 2008, a (temporary) herd of almost 50 animals was spotted by elephant-watchers in a tree hide; only a few years previously, there were probably far fewer than this in the whole area (Steinmetz <em>et al</em>. 2007; R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2008). By contrast, Gaur is largely gone from southern Thailand forest remnants, although it may be safe on the Malaysian border, reflecting tight control of illegal access and activities by the Border Patrol Police, and the danger of operations because of insurgency (A.J. Lynam pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>In Viet Nam, the current status of Gaur is poorly known. Several areas in Dak Lak Province (the Easo and Easup areas and Yok Don National Park) were known to contain Gaur in 1997 (Le Xuan Canh <em>et al</em>. 1997) but very little reliable information was traced for other parts of the country by Duckworth and Hedges (1998). Several herds of Gaur persist in Cat Tien National Park and in adjacent state forest enterprises (Polet and Ling 2004), where the population is now probably stable and even perhaps increasing (based on various secondary and verbal sources R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2013). Elsewhere however there seems little room for doubt that the Gaur population is still threatened, although at this point in time (late 2013) it is possible even probable that Gaur have largely been extirpated from all areas where no form of protection exists, and that even in most protected areas that harbour residual groups that declines are still the predominant trend, and many of the sites reported in Duckworth and Hedges (1998) may now have lost the species.",Decreasing,"Gaur historically occurred throughout mainland south and southeast Asia and Sri&#160;Lanka. Currently it occurs in scattered areas in the following range states:&#160;Bhutan, Cambodia, China, India, Lao PDR, Malaysia (Peninsular Malaysia only),&#160;Myanmar, Nepal, Thailand, and Viet Nam. However, it is extinct in Sri Lanka and also, as&#160;a resident, apparently in Bangladesh (Grubb 2005, Md Anwarul Islam in litt.&#160;2008, Hedges in prep.). The species is now seriously fragmented within its&#160;range, and the mapped distribution is generalised, especially in India, Lao, Myanmar, China and Malaysia.The domesticated form of Gaur, considered by IUCN a separate species (<em>Bos&#160;frontalis</em>; Mythun, Mithan or Gayal), occurs in parts of India, China, and&#160;Myanmar as feral, semi-feral, and domestic animals. This animal is excluded from&#160;the red-listing considerations for Gaur.","The Gaur is hunted for food, medicinal products and handicrafts products. A domesticated 'form' of Gaur (considered by many, including for Red List purposes as a separate species <em>Bos frontalis</em>) occurs in parts of the Indian subcontinent and is used as a draught animal and for meat. However such uses do not supply the same markets as 'wild' Gaur <em>Bos gaurus</em> products.",Terrestrial,"Gaur is listed in CITES Appendix I, and is legally protected in all range states. It occurs in many protected areas, although in north-east India, Myanmar, China, Lao PDR, Viet Nam and Malaysia many such areas retain only tiny populations or have already lost the species.<br/><br/>South and central India have a well established network of wildlife refuges and protection activities, to a large extent, are effective in many of them (F. Ahrestani pers. comm. 2008) and Gaur population in Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve in South India is perhaps the most secure one (Ahrestani and Karanth 2014) with about 5000 individuals (also the largest population of Gaurs in the world). However, conservation-oriented research and interventions on Gaur are limited and seem unlikely to expand much in the short-term, meaning that the species benefits largely through general protection activities (particularly those focused around Tiger and Asian Elephant), while species-specific negative factors or worrying long-term trends are likely to go unmanaged and even unnoticed (F. Ahrestani pers. comm. 2008). The chief of these seems to be competitive interaction with grazing stock: Gaur densities were the most depressed of all ungulates surveyed by Madhusudan (2004), perhaps reflecting higher niche overlap with domestic cattle than shown by the others (chiefly deer). There is long-term monitoring of some Gaur populations, for instance Mudumalai, Bandipur, Bhadra and Nagarahole (F. Ahrestani pers. comm. 2008, Karanth and Kumar unpub. data). Rinderpest has reportedly been eradicated from India (Choudhury 2002). Choudhury (2002) listed proposed aspects of protected area expansion and consolidation to slow further fragmentation of Gaur populations in southern and central India. <br/><br/>In some protected areas (recent examples being Bhadra and Kudremukh in Karnataka), formerly forest-dwelling human communities have resettled closer to markets, clinics, school and other services (Karanth and Karanth 2007). This expands habitat available to Gaur (that which was formerly fields and houses) but more significant is the removal of a source of hunters and the cessation of grazing competition with domestic stock (see Karanth et al. 2006). Such conservation interventions have helped recovery of Gaur populations in this region. Increasing development aspirations mean that out migration is likely from further areas, e.g. Mudumalai (F. Ahrestani pers. comm. 2008). <br/><br/>In contrast in Southeast Asia economic development and political stability in tandem with increased globalisation has resulted in accelerated loss and fragmentation of Gaur habitat, greater wildlife trade demand and a more insidious trade network (R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2013).<br/><br/>As the majority of the Gaur population is in South Asia, conservation activities are important there. It is also important that populations are maintained at least in several areas in Southeast Asia, to maintain Gaur presence through its historical range, to preserve Gaur genetic diversity and through its importance to the ecosystems within which it lives. Given the regional pattern of threats and current successes to date, implementing effective conservation interventions is considerably more challenging, and therefore a higher priority in the Southeast Asian region. <br/><br/>Gaur occurs mainly in protected areas in Southeast Asia, although Cambodia and Myanmar may both have large populations outside them and some may persist is such areas in Lao PDR (Duckworth 1996, Hansel 2004, SUFORD 2010). In most protected areas of Lao PDR, Viet Nam and Cambodia which still retain Gaur, protected status offers little, if any, real protection to the species, exceptions being Cat Tien National Park in Viet Nam, the Srepok Wilderness Area and the Siema Biodiversity Conservation Area in Cambodia; in the latter two Cambodian areas, there are now even signs of population recovery (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008), as there are at Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary and Thung Yai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuary, Thailand, with effective tackling of poaching (R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2008). Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary and Thung Yai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuary form part of Thailand's 'Western Forest Complex' which if these recent gains are consolidated will, in the long term, hold the largest functional Gaur population in Thailand and perhaps South-east Asia. <br/><br/>The most important conservation measure for the species in Cambodia is the continued strengthening and support of conservation efforts in Siema Biodiversity Conservation Area and the Srepok Wilderness Area, and to a lesser extent support of protected area conservation management in the northern plains and central Cardamoms. Likewise in Viet Nam, the most important conservation measure is the continued support of protection efforts within Cat Tien National Park, in Thailand it is to continue the consolidation of the 'Western Forest Complex' and to continue the high-intensity protection of the rebuilt herd in Khao Paeng Ma reforestation site, adjacent to Khao Yai National Park. In Myanmar the Hukaung Valley is an exceptional area of lowland plains forest, grassland, and wetlands. Part lies within the Wildlife Sanctuary and some of the rest of the outstanding plains habitat is within an enormous proposed extension. Through its size and mostly little-encroached condition, this is the most outstanding remaining landscape-level floodplains habitat for very large mammals remaining in tropical Asia, and although wildlife populations are highly depleted, warrants the strongest effort to conserve it. It faces a number of daunting challenges (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). In Lao PDR, any of a large number of areas could become key Gaur conservation sites, but there is as yet no precedent in the country for effective conservation of high-trade-value large mammals. Xe Pian, Xe Sap, Nam Et-Phou Louey, and Nakai-Nam Theun NPAs could all be highly significant areas for the species (Duckworth and Hedges 1998, Steinmetz 2004, Johnson et al. 2006, Timmins 2012) but so could almost any other NPA; the reality is that the most success with Gaur conservation is likely to come through identifying areas with positive underlying situations to achieve conservation, rather than identifying the area with the most intrinsic importance for Gaur as the focus for efforts. Choudhury (2002) listed aspects of protected area expansion and consolidation to slow further fragmentation of Gaur populations in north-east India, Nepal, and Bhutan, and perhaps allow repopulation of Bangladesh. <br/><br/>The most important actions in Malaysia are to determine if any viable population remains in the country and, if so, to implement effective anti-poaching measures and to work at the policy level to allow effective control of large mammal hunting and trading. Under the current circumstances, any site-based activities are likely to require the sort of 24-hour security employed at the reforestation site adjacent to Khao Yai National Park, Thailand, which has allowed a rapid population growth of Gaur. It may also require reintroduction. The Department of Wildlife and National Parks have a breeding population of captive Gaur in enclosures in the Jenderak ranger station (within Krau Wildlife Reserve), for captive release. <br/><br/>A large captive population exists of wild-type Gaur (as well as of Mythun); given the complexity of field conservation of large ungulates, particularly in South-east Asia, it is clearly in resolving issues of hunting, trade, and protected area effectiveness that conservation interventions must focus.",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

Population densities were estimated in south east Sulawesi where estimates range from 1.1-1.6 animals/km²<sup></sup> but with wide confidence limits (Mustari 2003, Burton <em>et al.</em> 2005) and Buton where density was estimated at 1.1 animals/km² (Wheeler 2004). Further estimates are as low as 0.07 animals/km²<sup></sup> in north Sulawesi (O’Brien and Kinnaird 1996) and as high as 2.4 animals/km²<sup></sup> from south east Sulawesi (Mustari 1995). On Buton island, Anoas appeared to use forests independent of their primary or secondary nature, the primary determinant of use being human activity in the forest (Dwiyahreni 2006, Wheeler <em>et al.</em> 2009). In Lore Lindu National Park, central Sulawesi track counts were highest in higher altitude areas away from the park’s fringes (Burton and MacDonald 2009, Okarda 2010). Riverine and lowland forests were preferred by Anoa compared to rocky-cliff forest in Tanjung Peropa Wildlife Reserve due to the availability of water sources, known food plants and fruit-bearing trees (Mustari 2003). In the past the species was reportedly common along coasts. Lowland Anoa are also found at high elevations in mountainous areas. Like other wild buffalo, Anoas wallow and bathe in pools of water and/or mud. It is probable that mineral springs or licks are also required, although Anoas are reported to drink seawater, which might fulfil their mineral needs in areas without licks or springs.<br/> <br/> The species is solitary though pairs of adults are occasionally encountered, presumably associated with breeding activity.

Priyono pers. comm. 2006). Recent reports indicate that hunting is by far the most serious threat. International trade in live animals or body parts is not thought to present a serious threat.</p>","There are too few data to accurately quantify the species' current abundance; nevertheless, Anoa still appear to be distributed relatively widely within their known<span class=""MsoCommentReference"">&#160;current range on Sulawesi. There have been declines of this species throughout Sulawesi, especially in the southern and northeastern peninsulas, with the decline attributed to hunting for meat and habitat loss (Indonesian Ministry of Forestry, 2013, Burton <em>et al</em>. 2005). The range is extremely fragmented, especially in the southern, northeastern and the south of the southeastern peninsulas of the island (Burton <em>et al</em>. 2005, B. Mannullang pers. comm. 2006). These declines probably began at the turn of the nineteenth century, with an increased rate of decline between 1980 and 2005 period (<em>circa</em> three generations), precipitously in some areas. The population size is unknown because there have been no island-wide or regional surveys which have attempted to estimate this, even for the largest populations. Estimating the population size is further complicated by the uncertain distribution of the two Anoa species. It is thought that there are fewer than 2,500 mature individuals. Most populations are becoming rapidly fragmented; suggesting that conservation of viable populations may soon require management of subpopulations (Burton <em>et al</em>. 2005). It is thought no subpopulation exceeds 250 mature individuals. Since the Lowland Anoa inhabits more accessible areas than the Mountain Anoa, the threats to this species, and thus the declines, are considered more serious for this species than for the Mountain Anoa.<br/> <br/> The Lowland Anoa populations in small reserves (e.g., Tanjung Amolengu Wildlife Reserve) and other forest fragments are threatened with local extinction. Even the populations in large protected areas and other large forest blocks are reported to be in decline as a result of heavy hunting pressure. O'Brien and Kinnaird (1996) report a 50 to 95% decline of this species in Tangkoko Nature Reserve in Northern Sulawesi in a 10-year period, with more recent surveys suggesting it is now locally extinct in in the reserve. The rate of population decline across their range is thought to be 20% over two generations (generation length of 7 to 9 years). The species’ ecology has been studied in the Tanjung Peropa and Tanjung Amolengo Wildlife Reserves in southeastern Sulawesi.",Decreasing,"<p>This species is endemic to Indonesia, where it is found only on Sulawesi and Buton Island off the southeast coast, with no records of either species of Anoas from other small neighbouring islands adjacent to Sulawesi (Burton <em>et al</em>. 2005).

It remains uncertain whether the two putative species, <em>Bubalus depressicornis</em> and <em>Bubalus quarlesi</em>, are sympatric or parapatric in their distribution (Burton <em>et al</em>. 2005). Across Sulawesi, local distribution of Anoa species remains unclear, as they may occur in forest patches at different altitudes or sympatrically (Burton <em>et al</em>. 2005). Records of skulls and morphological descriptions of this species suggest it is present in the northern peninsula, as far east as the Bogani Nani-Wartabone National Park. It is also found across the central region and ranging to the tip of the eastern and southeastern peninsulas, but no longer present in the southwestern peninsula. The Lowland Anoa is also present in the central and north of Buton Island (Burton <em>et al</em>. 2005).<br/> <br/> Historically, Anoa of one species or other were present throughout the majority of the island’s forests (Weber 1890, Sarasin and Sarasin 1901, Mohr 1921, Harper 1945, Groves 1969, Burton <em>et al</em>. 2005).</p>","Hunting for food is considered to be a threat to this species.

In 2013 the Indonesian Ministry of Forestry published a Strategy and Conservation Action Plan for Anoa 2013-2022. The vision of this plan is 'a stable population of Anoa in its wild habitat through reduced poaching (hunting) and illegal trade, maintenance of the existing habitat, through active involvement of the stakeholders'. A series of high priority sites for <em>in situ</em> conservation of Anoa have been identified: 11 in mainland Sulawesi, and two in Buton (Indonesian Ministry of Forestry 2013). These sites were selected based on a) representation of known subpopulations, extent of forest cover and connectivity between forested areas and status of management of area (whether sites were national parks, protected forests, restoration concessions). The plan also identifies protection from hunting, prevention of habitat loss, determining population status, education and training, and developing partnerships as important areas for future activities. It is too early to determine the impact of this new initiative.

The use of agrochemicals is severely reducing the availability of insects—the main food source of <em>D. sabanicola—</em>thus further affecting the population. Furthermore, there is evidence of severe hunting in several parts of its range, and it is the armadillo species that is most sought after by hunters in the llanos of Colombia. In Colombia, locals have reported a reduction in sightings of this species, but due to a lack of fieldwork, the population decline is difficult to quantify. <br/><br/>The factors affecting the Northern Long-nosed Armadillo warrant a precautionary assessment of Near Threatened, as it almost qualifies for listing under criteria A2cd and A3cd due to declines in habitat quality and quantity, as well due to estimated levels of exploitation, over three generations (suspected to be around 12 years). Among others, estimates suggest that about 10% of its natural habitat are subjected to land use change per year, and projections indicate that the area used for biofuel, timber and food production in the range of this species will increase more than ten-fold over the next decade.

The dietary specificity, low reproductive rates, large body size, along  with threats to habitat degradation in many parts of its range, have  proved to be significant factors in its decline. The giant anteater is currently listed in a threat category in virtually all regional and national Red Lists. A population loss of at least 30% over the past 10 years has been estimated based on local extinctions, habitat loss, and deaths caused by fires and road kills. Based on this decline and past threats that are still ongoing today, it is likely that the population has suffered an overall reduction in population size of &gt;30% over the last three generations (suspected to be around 21 years). Because of the real threats to this species and the noticeable declines, a precautionary assessment of Vulnerable is given. More data and population monitoring are required for this species, and a reassessment is recommended as soon as additional information becomes available.","This terrestrial anteater is found in tropical moist forest, dry forest, savanna habitats and open grasslands; it has also been reported from the Gran Chaco (Meritt 2008, Noss <em>et al.</em> 2008) and timber plantations (Kreutz <em>et al.</em> 2013).

Gestation length is 171 to 184 days (Bartmann 1983, Patzl <em>et al</em>. 1998, Knott <em>et al</em>. 2013). The mother carries the offspring on its back for approximately six months. Data from captive animals in European zoos show several females reproducing for the first time at 18-22 months, and the oldest known reproductive captive dams were 20-24 years old (unpublished report provided by I. Schappert). For wild females, sexual maturity is usually indicated as being around 2 years however, as it is not possible to determine their age once they reach adult size and long-term population studies on giant anteaters are lacking, there are no data on the longevity, survival rates, or reproductive rates of wild giant anteaters.<br/>The generation length of <em>M. tridactyla</em> in the wild is therefore unknown, but it is suspected to be around 7 years","<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Myrmecophaga tridactyla</span> is at risk from habitat loss in parts of its range, and this is a significant threat to Central American populations in particular.

The species was recently assessed as Near Threatened on the Chinese National Red List of Vertebrates. It is also assessed as Near Threatened here, because the current status can only be maintained with continued high levels of protection in its natural range and strict controls on trade and manufacture of the shawls made from its underfur: any relaxation in the protection regime are predicted to result in a rapid population decline due to commercial poaching at a rate meeting the threshold for a threatened category.","Chiru inhabit high altitude plains, undulating hills, plateaux and montane valleys at elevations of 3,250-5,500 m, consisting of alpine and desert steppe and meadows, characterized by low vegetation cover and low primary productivity (Leslie and Schaller 2008). Most populations are highly migratory or nomadic (Schaller 1998, Schaller <em>et al.</em> 2006), moving up to 300-400 km between summer and winter ranges; others are nonmigratory or migrate&#160;over much shorter distances&#160;(Harris and Miller 1995, Leslie and Schaller 2008). Males and females are usually separate except for the mating period. Females congregate to give birth in traditional birthing grounds, some of which (e.g. Central Kunlun) have only recently been identified. The ecological parameters of these sites are not fully understood. In Chang Tang Nature Reserve, Chiru had a negative association with settlements and preferred areas with gentle slopes, moderate density of grazing livestock, villages only at lower elevations (Qi <em>et al.</em> 2015).","The prevalence and magnitude of commercial scale hunting of Chiru for shahtoosh in the late 1980s and 1990s led to a severe decline in numbers (Wright and Kumar 1997). Since, measures to restrict illegal hunting and smuggling of the product have become increasingly effective, however the demand still exists and maintaining strict controls on poaching, trade, and manufacture of the fabric are essential in ensuring the status of the species. Other important threats include expansion of livestock herding into remote and previously unused areas (Fox and Bårdsen 2005), for instance Chiru in the Chang Tang region now shares rangeland with &gt;8 million livestock (Harris 2008); road building, facilitating the expansion of agriculture and illegal hunting (Yin <em>et al.</em> 2006); and fencing of pastures on the Tibetan plateau (Fox <em>et al.</em> 2009). Construction of the Beijing-Lhasa railway threatened to divide the Chiru's range but engineering measures, such as underpasses, have allowed the Chiru's migration to continue to some extent. Chiru are also vulnerable to severe winter conditions, especially heavy snow, which can confine populations to limited areas and can result in disproportionate death of young, subadults, and females, presumably from malnutrition (Leslie and Schaller 2008). An exceptional snowstorm in Qinghai in 1985 caused high mortality and led to their disappearance from some areas especially in the eastern part of their range (Schaller and Ren 1988).","Numbers may have reached a historic high of perhaps one million but are far less now. The population underwent a severe decline in the 1980s and early 1990s as a result of commercial poaching for the valuable underfur, leading to an estimated 65,000-72,500 by the mid-1990s (Schaller 1998). Rigorous protection has been enforced since then. Leslie and Schaller (2008) suggested there may be 100,000.  Feng (1999) estimated 100,000 to 120,000, while Xi and Wang (2004) estimated 150,000. Liu (2009) said the population had doubled since the mid-1990s (i.e. now <em>ca</em> 150,000). Densities of 0.03-9.21 individuals/km²<sup></sup>, with an average of 1.77/km²<sup></sup> were reported by Leslie and Schaller (2008). The migratory nature and clumped distribution of the Tibetan Antelope complicate extrapolation and calculation of accurate population estimates, but all recent Chinese sources agree that the population has been increasing. The species was recently assessed as Near Threatened in the Chinese Red List of Vertebrates (Jiang <em>et al.</em> 2016).",Increasing,"This antelope formerly ranged across the whole Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Almost its entire range lies within China. A small number occur seasonally in north-eastern Ladakh, in the extreme north of India and the species formerly occurred in a small area of northwest Nepal (Schaller 1977). Its range has decreased and it is now absent from most of the eastern plateau and from Nepal. The main stronghold of the species is in the Chang Tang area of north-western Tibet (Schaller 1998).","Chiru have long been hunted for their underfur - shahtoosh (Wright and Kumar 1997), which is renowned for its quality and which has traditionally been transported to Srinagar in Kashmir, where it is woven into an extremely fine fabric used to make shawls; a traditional wedding gift in India and Pakistan. However it takes 3-5 hides to make a single shawl, and the wool cannot be sheared or combed, so to collect the fur the animals have to be killed (Leslie and Schaller 2008). This hunting escalated to a commercial scale in the late 1980s and 1990s, when according to the Chinese government, about 20,000 Chirus were hunted annually, primarily for their shahtoosh. Strict controls were introduced in China in the early 1990s, and the trade was also banned in India. Trade has been severely curtailed, though not completely eliminated, due to high demand and high prices: within India, shawls are worth $1,000-$5,000, internationally the price can reach as high as $20,000. Horns of the males were traditionally used as gun rests, and to a limited extent in traditional Chinese medicine.",Terrestrial,"The Chiru is legally protected in China and India (Wright and Kumar 1997, Schaller 1998), but enforcement of the law over the vast area of its habitat has been problematic, although efforts have intensified since the early 1990s (Zhen 1999). Public awareness of the Chiru within China has increased, and some populations have begun to respond (Schaller <em>et al.</em> 2003). Chiru occur in Qiantang (300,000 km²<sup></sup>), Kekexili (45,000 km²<sup></sup>), Arjin Shan (45,000 km<sup>²</sup>), Sanjiangyuan (150,000 km²<sup></sup>) National Nature Reserves and West Kunlun (30,000 km²<sup></sup>) and Central Kunlun (32,000 km²<sup></sup>) provincial nature reserves. This network of reserves is important to the Chiru due to its migratory behaviour, with about 75% of its migratory routes protected by this network. Since 2002, the International Fund for Animal Welfare has organized and sponsored an annual workshop for nature reserve staff and other officials from the three Chinese provinces where the majority of the population is concentrated (Tibet, Qinghai, Xinjiang).<br/><br/>The species is listed on Appendix I of CITES.<br/><br/>Chiru are virtually unknown in zoos, but young have been born and orphans have been reared successfully in a 200 ha fenced enclosure in native habitat (Leslie and Schaller 2008).",Palearctic,,false,false,Global
50194357,19832,Saiga tatarica,Critically Endangered,A2acd,2018,2018-02-16 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Although the Saiga currently does not meet the Red List Criteria thresholds for Critically Endangered, the previous assessment of CR A2acd is retained in this assessment because this reassessment falls under the IUCN’s five year rule. This rule applies to taxa that appear to be genuinely improving in status, and states that “a taxon may be moved from a category of higher threat to a category of lower threat if and when none of the criteria of the higher category has been met for five years or more”. The Saiga is considered to have crossed the thresholds between CR and EN around 2015, therefore its status will be re-evaluated again in 2020. Saiga currently meets the thresholds for Endangered under criterion A4 based on observed, estimated and projected declines of &gt;50% over 11 years (three generations), commencing from May 2015, due to the risk of mass mortality events (MME) resulting from outbreaks of disease, exacerbated by climatic and environmental factors, and taking place alongside ongoing poaching pressure for the illegal trade in horns. Saiga populations are inherently vulnerable to mass mortality from a range of diseases. Since 2010, four disease outbreaks have caused large-scale mortality in Saiga. The most severe resulted in the death of over 200,000 Saiga in the course of three weeks in May 2015. The cause of this outbreak (and suspected in the earlier two) has been shown to be haemorrhagic septicaemia caused by the bacterium <em>Pasteurella multocida</em>, which is endemic in Saiga. Lethal levels of infection are believed to have been triggered by environmental conditions including abnormally high humidity and temperature. Warm and wet climatic conditions are expected to increase in frequency due to effects of recorded and predicted climate change. The most recent MME occurred in the Mongolian population in early 2017, caused by PPR, and killed an estimated 54% of the population. Saiga are also subject to strong commercial hunting pressure and the survival of viable populations is entirely dependent on stringent implementation of conservation measures.","The Saiga is a nomadic herding species that inhabits open dry steppe grasslands and semi-arid deserts of Central Asia. Typical habitat consists of flat open areas covered with low-growing vegetation, allowing animals to run quickly; areas of broken terrain or dense cover are generally avoided, but animals may stray into these out of necessity or shelter in them during strong winds, they range from near or below sea level in the Caspian basin to ca. 1600 m in Mongolia (Heptner <em>et al. </em>1961, Bekenov <em>et al. </em>1998).<br/><br/>Saiga are migratory, with most populations having widely separated summer (northern) and winter (southern) ranges. The species lives in large herds, usually up to thousands of individuals. It has a high rate of reproduction and recruitment since females usually breed at 7-8 months and males in their second year (Heptner <em>et al. </em>1961) and females often bear twins. In years with a favourable climate the population can increase by up to 60% in a single year (Chan <em>et al.</em> 1995). Very few animals in a population are more than 3.5 years old, indicating that the population is almost completely renewed after four years (Bekenov <em>et al.</em> 1998). Males defend a harem of 5-10 females and gestation lasts about 5 months (Heptner <em>et al.</em> 1961). Saiga are grazers and have been recorded feeding on a wide range of grasses and herbaceous plant species.<br/><br/>For full details of the biology of the species see Heptener <em>et al.</em> (1961) and Sokolov and Zhirnov (1998).","Uncontrolled illegal hunting for horns and meat since the break-up of the former USSR has led to the catastrophic fall in Saiga numbers. Selective hunting of young males and subsequent distortion of the sex ratio has also affected reproduction by heavily skewing the sex ratio (Milner-Gulland <em>et al.</em> 2003). A second significant threat is the destruction of key habitats and traditional migration routes. The recent increase in steppe fires is a further cause for concern. <br/><br/>Extreme climatic events, pose a threat, drought in summer and severe winters, especially heavy snow or ‘<em>dzuud</em>’ or ‘<em>dzut</em>’ conditions when an ice-crust forms on top of snow and impedes access to forage. Several resulting instances of mass-mortality are known, such as the winter of 1953/54 in Kazakhstan when 80,000 animals died (Heptner <em>et al.</em> 1961).<br/><br/>Saiga are susceptible to several diseases, including foot-and-mouth disease, brucellosis and others, which may also cause large numbers of deaths. There have been four recent mass-mortality events (MME). In 2010, around two-thirds of a calving aggregation of 20,000 in the Ural population died of a peracute respiratory disease with bloat, and this was followed in 2011 by a smaller die-off of several hundreds of Saiga with similar clinical signs, immediately after calving, and grazing in the exact same location as the earlier MME, suggesting a site-specific cause. Pasteurellosis was implicated based on clinical signs and bacteriology, but very little pathology was undertaken (Kock <em>et al. </em>2018).<br/><br/>In 2015, more than 200,000 Saiga died within three weeks in central Kazakhstan. The proximate cause of death, based on multiple strands of evidence, was confirmed as haemorrhagic septicaemia caused by the bacterium <em>Pasteurella multocida</em> type B (Kock <em>et al.</em> 2018). Statistical modelling suggests that there was unusually high relative humidity and temperature in the days leading up to the outbreak; temperature and humidity anomalies were also observed in two previous similar events in the same region. The modelled influence of environmental covariates is consistent with known drivers of haemorrhagic septicemia. Given the Saiga population’s vulnerability to mass mortality and the likely exacerbation of climate-related and environmental stressors in the future, management of risks to population viability, such as poaching and viral livestock disease, is urgently needed, as well as robust ongoing veterinary surveillance (Kock<em> et al.</em> 2018).<br/><br/>On 22nd December 2016 the first death of a Mongolian Saiga (<em>S. t. mongolica</em>) was reported by herders to the local authorities in Darvi Soum in the Khuisiin Gobi. Hundreds of live and dead Saiga were subsequently observed with a PPR-like syndrome and signs. Samples were confirmed at the Mongolia State Central Veterinary Laboratory (SCVL) on 6th January 2017 to contain PPR virus and gene sequencing confirmed the virus to be of high similarity to the virus recorded in sheep and goats. The Saiga infection developed rapidly into a full-blown epidemic and by the end of January; death and infection were reported across most of the Saiga range (Kock 2017). Based on carcass counts, over 54% of the population is estimated to have died.","Historically, herds numbered in the millions. Excessive hunting reduced them to an estimated total of <em>ca</em> 1,000 by the early 20th century (Heptner <em>et al.</em> 1961) though the accuracy of this estimate is unclear. The species received legal protection in 1919 and soon began to recover. By 1960 Saiga numbers had reached 540,000 in Russia and 1,300,000 in Kazakhstan (Linnard 1963). Commercial harvests resumed in the 1950s and continued until 1990. There were still an estimated 1,250,000 Saiga in the mid-1970s.<br/><br/>In European Russia, the Saiga population steeply declined along with land reclamation of the Volga basin, but the species remained numerous. In the 1970s the population recovered to <em>ca</em> 700,000-800,000 as a result of hunting regulation. In 1980 there were an estimated 380,000 individuals, in 1996 there were 196,000, and by the year 2000 just 26,000 (see Milner-Gulland <em>et al.</em> 2001 for annual survey results for 1980–2000).<br/><br/>Saiga numbers fell catastrophically from 1989 on, when political and economic changes that accompanied the break-up of the USSR led to weakening of nature protection systems and severe economic hardship, while at the same time, international borders were opened up, enhancing the opportunities for trading Saiga horn (Mallon 2016b and references therein). Poaching for horns surged and large numbers were killed locally for meat. The largest population of Saiga fell to 4% of its 1990 size and other populations also suffered large reductions (Milner-Gulland <em>et al.</em> 2001). Evidence from Russia indicated that selective harvesting had left a skewed population containing few adult males, many females without young, and the population close to reproductive collapse (Milner-Gulland <em>et al.</em> 2003). The full scale of the catastrophic decline was detailed by Arylov <em>et al.</em> (2004). Numbers in Kazakhstan fell to only 21,000 in 2003. The species was assessed as Critically Endangered in 2002. <br/><br/>A wide range of conservation measures was implemented and Saiga numbers stabilized then increased (Milner-Gulland 2010). The largest population, in Betpak-dala, Kazakhstan, grew by 76% annually during 2003 and 2010, demonstrating the resilience of the species. However, poaching and other factors reduced Saiga numbers in Russia and caused a 47% decrease in Ustyurt during 2009-2010. In May 2010 a disease outbreak killed <em>ca</em> 12,000 Saiga in the Ural population, a 31% loss. Nevertheless, numbers continued to grow overall and by spring 2015 there were &gt;300,000 Saiga in Kazakhstan, plus a few thousand each in in Russia and Mongolia. Then in September 2015 a mass die-off occurred in Betpak-dala, the largest population, with at least 200,000 dying in the course of three weeks (Milner-Gulland 2015, Kock <em>et al.</em> 2018). Numbers in Kazakhstan have rebounded, and results of the annual aerial census conducted 11-30 April 2017 showed a total of 152,600 Saiga (98,200 in Ural, 51,700 in Betpak-dala, 2,700 in Ustyurt), representing a 40.9% increase since 2016 (Grachev 2017). The small population in eastern Kazakhstan is not covered by the annual surveys and is estimated to number <em>ca</em> 2,000 (S. Zuther pers. comm. 2017).&#160; <br/><br/>Dash <em>et al.</em> (1977) reported only 200 Mongolian Saiga. That population increased, reaching <em>ca</em> 3,000 in 1998 and 5,200 in 2000 helped by favourable climatic conditions and active conservation measures. Numbers fell again between 2000 and 2002 as a result of severe winters and summer drought. The decline continued in 2002–2003, mainly because of poaching. Estimated numbers were <em>ca</em> 1,020 in 2003, and 750 in January 2004. However, Young <em>et al.</em> (2010) estimated 4,938 Mongolian Saiga in 2006 and 7,221 in 2007. The population had risen to <em>ca</em> 11,000 in 2016, when an outbreak of peste de petits ruminants (PPR) struck, killing <em>ca</em> 54% of the population: <em>ca</em> 5,000 are now believed to remain. <br/><br/>The global population of Saiga in January 2018 is estimated at 164,600-165,600: 154,600 in Kazakhstan, 5,000-6,000 in Russia and <em>ca</em> 5,000 in Mongolia. The number of mature individuals is estimated at 123,450-124,200.",Decreasing,"Saiga once inhabited the steppes and semi-desert regions of south-eastern Europe and across Central Asia to Mongolia and north-west China, but the original range has been greatly reduced. Saiga became extinct in Ukraine in the 18th century and disappeared from China in the middle of the 20th century (Cui <em>et al.</em> 2017). In 1958 the range covered an estimated 2.5 million km² (Heptner <em>et al.</em> 1961).<br/><br/>Currently, there are five Saiga populations: one in Russia, three in Kazakhstan and one in Mongolia. In Russia, Saiga are confined to the Pre-Caspian steppes north-west of the Caspian Sea in Kalmykia and adjoining parts of Astrakhan Region. A small number of Saiga have also been seen recently in Orenburg State Reserve, presumably having dispersed from the Betpak-dala population in Kazakhstan (A.A. Lushchekina pers. comm. 2017). <br/><br/>The three Kazakhstan populations are located in Ural in the north-west (partially transboundary with Russia); Betpak-dala in central Kazakhstan (the largest population), and Ustyurt. Animals from the Ustyurt population move south in winter into Uzbekistan, in some years reaching Turkmenistan. These transboundary movements have declined in range and frequency and no Saiga have been seen in Turkmenistan for several years. The number reaching Uzbekistan has also declined, further limited by construction of a border fence. There is a small outlying population east of Betpak-dala in the Semipalatinsk region.<br/><br/>The nominate subspecies also formerly occurred in the Dzungarian Gobi of far south-western Mongolia, presumably as a transboundary population with China, but has not been seen there in 40 years. The distinctive Mongolian subspecies occurs in western Mongolia, north of the Altai mountains, which isolate its range from the nominate subpopulations. Mongolian Saiga once occurred through the Great Lakes Basin from the north-west corner, east to approximately 101°E (Bannikov 1954), but both range and numbers have been severely reduced. Its current distribution range is centred on the Shargiin Gobi and Huisiin Gobi, with a small subpopulation in the Mankhan area. The range has expanded onto the Dorgon steppe in recent years.","The horns of male Saiga are highly valued in Traditional Asian Medicine (Chan <em>et al</em>. 1995).&#160;A legal harvest with fixed quotas operated from the 1950s to 1990. Harvests were formerly on an industrial scale, using trucks and a team of up to 20 hunters on each; e.g. west of the Volga River, 120,000-150,000 Saiga were harvested per year during 1957-1962 (Linnard 1963).",Terrestrial,"This species is listed on the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) Appendix II and the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) Appendix II.&#160;The CMS Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) Concerning Conservation, Restoration and Sustainable Use of the Saiga Antelope came into effect in 2006 and has been signed by all five range states and ten Cooperating Organizations (local and international NGOs). The MoU has an associated Medium-Term International Work Programme (MTIWP) setting out a framework for conservation action by all partners. The MTIWP is reviewed and updated periodically at technical workshops preceding CMS MoU range state meetings. <br/><br/>Saiga are protected in all range states but the level of enforcement varies. Anti-poaching efforts in Kazakhstan and other countries have been intensified over the last 10 years. <br/><br/>Some protected areas exist within Saiga range but the distance between summer and winter ranges of some populations hinders full protected area coverage. In Russia, most Saiga are found in Chernye Zemli Biosphere Reserve (1,219 km²), established in 1990, and the adjoining Stepnoi Sanctuary (1,090 km²). In Kazakhstan the Irgiz-Turgai Sanctuary (7,635 km²) and Altyn Dala State Nature Reserve (4,897 km²) were established to protect Saiga populations. In Uzbekistan the Saigachy Sanctuary was redesignated in 2015 to provide better coverage of Saiga range and now covers <em>ca</em>. 7,000 km². The Mongolian Saiga has been legally protected since 1953. Two protected areas, Sharga NR (2,869 km²) and Mankhan NR (300 km²), were gazetted in 1993 to protect most of the remaining areas of distribution.<br/><br/>Small groups of Saiga have been kept in zoos in Europe and the USA but the species is difficult to maintain in captivity. Small rescue and captive breeding centres exist in Russia and Kazakhstan. About 600 Saiga are kept in extensive semi-captive conditions at the Askania Nova centre in Ukraine. A workshop to review options for Saiga captive breeding and reintroduction took place in Moscow in August 2017.",Palearctic,,false,false,Global
50657407,15452,Leopardus jacobita,Endangered,C2a(i),2016,2014-04-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The most recent information confirms that the Andean Cat is a rare species, occurring at low densities and with a patchy distribution due to a specialization for rocky habitats.<br/><br/>New records of the Andean Cat in Argentina extended its distribution range to the south and outside the Andes, into Patagonian steppe and shrub habitats, at elevations as low as 650 m (Novaro <em>et al.</em> 2010, Martinez <em>et al.</em> 2008). However, a study of the population genetics of the Andean Cat throughout most of its range (Cossios <em>et al.</em> 2012) indicated that the species has a very low mitochondrial and nuclear genetic diversity and identified two distinct Andean Cat populations that should be considered as two ""Evolutionary Significant Units” (ESUs), the highland cats from the previously-known distribution and the newly-discovered population in the Patagonian steppe. Moreover, the northern ESU contains two genetically different groups, showing limited or no exchange of individuals between them, which should be considered as two ""Management Units” (MUs).<br/><br/>Habitat loss and degradation is an increasing concern in most areas where the Andean Cat is present, due to the expansion of the agricultural frontier, inadequate livestock management and water extraction, as well as water and soil contamination for a growing mining and petroleum industry activity in the South American highlands and the Patagonian steppe. The Andean Cat will be affected negatively by global climate change throughout most of its range by a decrease in the geographical distribution (Bennett <em>et al.</em> submitted) and more recently by rapid expansion of exploitation of shale oil and gas through hydraulic fracturing or fracking in northern Patagonia (Walker <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/><br/>Additionally, Andean Cats are being killed by herders in Patagonia in retaliation for predation (Novaro <em>et al.</em> 2010) and in northwestern Argentina high mortality rates due to hunting by local people have also been inferred (Lucherini and Merino 2008). More recently, information gathered from monitoring Andean Cats and Pampas Cats with GPS collars in north-western Argentina suggests that competition between these two species may affect negatively Andean Cat populations and make them more susceptible to the mentioned threats (Tellaeche 2015).<br/><br/>Based on Andean Cat distribution records an extent of occurrence (EOO) of 1,530,818 km² was estimated. However, due to the specificity of Andean Cat to steep rocky environments, this area encompasses large areas between sites of records that are uninhabitable. In a preliminary estimation in a study area of 6,863 km² in Patagonia, only 1.4% of the total area was steep rocky areas. Additionally, in a study area of approximately 65,000 km² in Patagonia, only 3% of the cells in a grid size of 10x10 km were occupied, based on confirmed and unconfirmed Andean Cat records (Walker and Palacios, unpublished data).<br/><br/>This estimation can have more than one source of error (for example it uses still unconfirmed records) and was calculated for the Patagonian steppe, an environment that is different from that of the highland habitats in the northern and central part of the Andean cat distribution, where there is a greater proportion of rocky habitat. Therefore, to be conservative we estimated that 10% of the current EOO of the Andean Cat could actually be occupied.<br/><br/>Taking into account 10% of the EOO and the lowest density of 0.018 ind/km² (Huaranca <em>et al.</em> 2013), estimated for a region considered to have one of the most favourable climatic conditions for the Andean Cat (Marino <em>et al.</em> 2011), the total population of the Andean Cat is estimated at 2,755 individuals. Because no information about population structure is available, using a default value of 50% for the proportion of mature individuals within the Andean Cat population, only 1,378 would be mature individuals (see Table 1 in the Supplemental Material).<br/><br/>No information exists on trends with regard to habitat modification or destruction in the distribution area of the Andean Cat; but as early as 2002, the conservation status of the Patagonian Steppe and the Central Andean Puna were considered as Critically Endangered (CR) and Vulnerable (V), respectively, with habitat loss and fragmentation the most serious threats affecting their conservation status (Olson and Dinerstein 2002). There is no evidence that this situation has improved; an evaluation of the progress in the implementation of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 mentioned that most of the different habitats, including grasslands and wetlands, are still fragmenting and degrading (SCDB 2014).<br/><br/>Mining activities have increased and the associate use of water resources is impacting negatively most of the areas where the Andean cat presence has been confirmed; in the case of northern Argentinean Patagonia, fracking is an additional threat (Walker <em>et al.</em> 2013). In Bolivia, mining is a priority activity and mainly situated in the Andean mountain range; extractive mining without environmental precautions is increasing (Ribera 2013). In Chile, mining industry is an important part of the country´s economy and is mainly developed in the northern region, where the Andean cat is distributed and water is a scarce resource. There, the fragile high Andean ecosystems are being degraded and a reduction of the wetlands is predicted in Chile because of the effects of climate change (IEB, CASEB, CCG-UC - CONAMA 2010). In the Peruvian report to the Biodiversity Convention, it is mentioned that in recent years the transformation of natural ecosystems has increased due to changes in land use, particularly by extractive activities such as mining; a trend of transformation, desertification and erosion is mentioned for the fragile wetlands and grasslands in the Peruvian Andes (Ministerio del Ambiente 2014).<br/><br/>Considering the threats to the Andean Cat, the natural fragmentation of the habitat and the increasing trend in fragmentation due to habitat loss and degradation, a continued decline of the population number is inferred.<br/><br/>Based on the available data on Andean Cat distribution and genetic analysis of samples from most areas, 10 subpopulations were identified for the Andean Cat (see Table 2 and Figure 1 in the Supplemental Material). Three subpopulations in Peru (1=north, 2=west, 3=east); two in Bolivia (4=north, 5=centre east); one subpopulation shared among south Peru, centre west Bolivia and northern Chile (6); one subpopulation shared among south-western Bolivia, centre east Chile and north-western Argentina (7); and three subpopulations in Argentina (8=north centre, 9= centre west and 10=southern west). Although some of these could be connected, more studies and more samples for genetic studies are needed.In the meantime, as a precautionary measure these 10 subpopulations are identified.<br/><br/>The estimate of the number of mature individuals for each subpopulation was made in the same way as for the estimation of the total number of mature individuals of the whole Andean cat species. The area of each subpopulation polygon was estimated using the Minimum Bounding Geometry, Convex hull function in ArcGIS. As these polygons are all occupied areas within the EOO, we did not reduce the area to 10% as we did for the overall range. However, even within these occupied areas, occupancy and habitat use by Andean cats is patchy, and they are constrained to rocky places associated with wetlands and/or shrublands. Thus, considering new detailed information on space use (Lucherini <em>et al.</em> unpublished data, Huaranca unpublished data, Lagos unpublished data), we, estimated that only 40% of each subpopulation polygon is actually used by Andean Cats, and reduced the size of all polygons accordingly&#160;(see Table 2 and Figure 1 in the Supplemental Material). The largest subpopulation is estimated to contain 172 mature individuals.<br/><br/>A further reason for concern about the conservation of this cat species, and for adopting a precautionary approach to its categorization is climate change. According to Bennett <em>et al.</em> (submitted) the current bioclimatic distribution of the Andean Cat is clearly affected by climate change. By 2080, under the scenario A2 (medium to high emissions) the distribution area is expected to decrease between 15 and 30%, depending on the cut-off point used in the distribution model. Parallel to this, the model shows an increase in elevation in the north and central distribution, which puts the species even more at risk, because the environmental conditions at higher elevations do not provide the habitat requirements necessary for the Andean cat (Bennett <em>et al.</em> submitted).<br/><br/>More studies are needed to confirm the definition of the subpopulations presented here and to improve our estimates of the population size of each one of them, but considering the precautionary principle, the analysis described above supports the classification of the Andean Cat as Endangered.","<p>The Andean Cat is found primarily in rocky and steep terrains, in arid and sparsely vegetated areas of the high Andes above the timberline, and in scrub and steppe habitats within the Andean foothills of Central Argentina and the Patagonian steppe ecological region (Napolitano<span class=""apple-converted-space""> <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2008, Novaro <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2010).&#160; In general, climatic conditions are extreme with very low temperatures, large daily thermal variations and low precipitation that determine the presence of adapted plants such as bunchgrasses, cushion plants, and low shrubs with small or resinous leaves (Cabrera and Willink 1973). The presence of high Andean wetlands known as “bofedales” and “vegas” is characteristic in the high Andes and are an important resource for wildlife and domestic animals (Villalba <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2004).<br/> &#160;<br/> The Andean Cat distribution is similar to the historic range of the Short-tailed Chinchilla (<em>Chinchilla chinchilla</em>) and current range of the mountain vizcacha (<em>Lagidium</em><span class=""apple-converted-space""> spp.) (Yensen and Seymour 2000), which are its major prey (Walker <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2007, Napolitano <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2008). According to the results of diet studies in Argentina, Bolivia and Chile, and compared with that of other Andean carnivores, the Andean Cat occupies narrower niche with&#160; a wide overlap with the Pampas Cat diet (Walker <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2007, Marino <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2010). Rodents constitute the main prey item and the Mountain Vizcacha in three out of five diet studies was the more frequent prey: 52% and 43-53% in southern Bolivia and 44.1% in northern Chile (Viscarra 2008, Napolitano <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2008, Torrico 2009). In a diet study with samples mostly collected in northern Argentina, unidentified small rodents were the most frequent prey (37.3%), followed by the mountain vizcacha 28% (Walker <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2007); Tellaeche (2010) for a single locality in northern Argentina, also reported that small mammals were the item most frequently consumed by the Andean Cat (93.3% of the faeces), particularly rodents of the genus <em>Phyllotis</em><span class=""apple-converted-space""> (found in 76.9% of the samples). Among the Andean Cat prey items, the mountain vizcacha has the greatest body mass by far; consequently it contributes significantly to the Andean Cat diet (Walker <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2007, Napolitano <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2008).<br/> <br/> The Andean Cat is thought to be a solitary species, but may be seen in pairs or with kittens during the mating season and after the births of kittens respectively (Villalba<span class=""apple-converted-space""> <em><span lang=""EN-US"">et a<span lang=""EN-GB"">l</span></em>. 2004). Mating season, according to local people in Bolivia, is between July and August (Villalba and Bernal 1999); however, it is possible that this period could be much longer, because small cubs have been observed in October and from April to September (Villalba 2002, Villalobos<span class=""apple-converted-space""> <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. In prep., Lucherini Unpublished data). Two kittens were seen by Villalba (2002), and what appears to be an older single cub by Sorli <em><span lang=""EN-US""><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em><span class=""apple-converted-space""> <span class=""apple-converted-space"">(2006).<br/> <br/> Most of the reported sightings of Andean Cats have been during daytime; however the radio-tracking of the first radio-collared Andean Cat in southern Bolivia recorded main activity peaks at dusk or at night, between 18:00 and 23:00 hours (Villalba<span class=""apple-converted-space""> <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2009); similarly the results of 1,596 camera-trap photos from different localities in Argentina, Bolivia and Chile showed the following proportions for Andean Cat activity: 37.6% at night, 34.4% crepuscular, and 28% during the day (Lucherini <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2009). Additionally, the results indicated that the Andean Cat activity overlaps largely with that of the mountain vizcacha, a diurnal and crepuscular species (Galende <em><span lang=""EN-US"">et a<span lang=""EN-GB"">l</span></em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 1998).<br/> <br/> Data on territoriality is absent, however, as occurs with most felids (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002), it is possible that male territories are larger than those of females and that there could be a certain degree of territory overlap between the sexes. Because the conditions of the Andean Cat habitat are severe and naturally fragmented, it is probable that territory and home ranges are very large; a radio-tracked female Andean Cat, between April and December 2004, had a home range of 65.5 km² (95% minimum convex polygon: Villalba<span class=""apple-converted-space""> <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2009).</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""> The Andean Cat is a medium-sized felid; from measures of skins the total length in adults varies from 740 to 850 mm and in sub-adults varies from 577 to 600 mm; tail length is from 410 to 485 for adults and 330 to 420 mm for sub-adults. Only two records on the weight are available, the first from a sub-adult specimen from Peru, which weighed 4 kg (Pearson 1957, García-Perea 2002) and the second is from an adult female from Bolivia which weighed 4.5 kg (Delgado <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em><span class=""apple-converted-space""> 2004).<br/> <br/> Andean Cat fur is mainly ash grey with brown-yellowish blotches that are distributed as vertical lines at both sides of the body, giving the appearance of continuous stripes. The tail of the Andean cat is very characteristic. It is very long (66 - 75% of the head and body length), thick and cylindrical, with a fluffy aspect and with 6 to 9 wide rings of dark brown to black colour (García-Perea 2002). The legs also have dark and narrower blotches or stripes, but they don’t form complete rings.<br/> <br/> Apparently the species is not sexually dimorphic in terms of fur colour, but comparisons among Andean Cat skulls carried out by García-Perea (2002) suggest that sexual dimorphism is present. Differences between juvenile and adult specimens were also found, with juveniles having a lighter coloration and more and smaller blotches (García-Perea 2002). Because of these features, sub-adult or juvenile Andean Cats can be confused much more easily with Pampas Cats (García-Perea 2002).<br/> </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>","<p>In the early 2000s the Andean Cat Alliance considered traditional hunting the top threat, followed by prey reduction and habitat loss and fragmentation (Villalba<span class=""apple-converted-space""> <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2004), four years later a re-evaluation of the threats affecting the Andean Cat, established that habitat loss and habitat degradation are the main current threats; hunting (opportunistic/palliative or traditional) and reduction of prey populations are considered as the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> threats, in order of importance (ACA 2011: Andean Cat Alliance Strategic Plan).<br/> <br/> Expansion of the agricultural frontier, inadequate livestock management and water extraction for a growing mining and petroleum industry activity in the South American highlands and the Patagonian steppe are altering the Andean Cat habitat. The Andean Cat will be affected negatively by global climate change throughout most of its range by a decrease in the geographic distribution (Bennett<span class=""apple-converted-space""> <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. in progress) and more recently by rapid expansion of exploitation of shale oil and gas through hydraulic fracturing or fracking in northern Patagonia (Walker <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2013).<br/> <br/> Hunting by local people who consider the Andean Cat a predator of their small domestic livestock has been frequently reported particularly in some regions of Argentina, Chile and Peru (Iriarte 1998, Cossíos and Madrid 2003, Lucherini and Merino 2008). Andean Cats are being killed by herders in Patagonia in retaliation for predation (Novaro<span class=""apple-converted-space""> <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2010). These cats are also killed by dogs accompanying local shepherds and in north-western Argentina high mortality rates due to hunting by local people have also been inferred (C. Tellaeche and M. Lucherini unpub. data). Cossios <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. (2007) also reported the hunting of Andean and Pampas Cats for food and for traditional medicine in central Peru.<br/> <br/> Particularly in Bolivia, Peru and northern Chile, the Andean Cat (as well as the Pampas Cat) is considered a sacred animal according to indigenous Aymara and Quechua traditions. Throughout much of its range, dried and stuffed specimens are kept by local people for use in harvest festivals (Iriarte 1999, Sanderson 1999,<span class=""apple-converted-space""> Villalba<span class=""apple-converted-space""> <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2004, Cossios <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2007, Villalba <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2012). <span class=""apple-converted-space"">Hunting for such cultural practices may represent a significant threat to the species.<br/> <br/> The Short-tailed Chinchilla was likely to have been a major prey species for the Andean Cat, but the species was hunted nearly to extinction for the fur trade (Nowell and Jackson 1996). In most of its range, the main prey of the Andean Cat is now the Mountain Vizcacha (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2007, Viscarra 2008, Napolitano <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008, Torrico 2009), which lives in patchily distributed small colonies and has also been reduced by hunting pressure. This may result in a highly fragmented distribution for the Andean Cat. Intra-guild competition, especially with the Pampas Cat, for Mountain Vizcacha prey, could negatively impact the Andean Cat (Lucherini and Luengos Vidal 2003, Walker <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em><span class=""apple-converted-space""> 2007, Reppucci 2012).</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>","<p>Until now three population estimates on Andean Cat were carried out. Napolitano<span class=""apple-converted-space""> <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. (2008), based on genetic sampling estimated five individuals to occur in a 25,000 ha area in northern Chile, around the Salar de Surire National Monument, resulting in a density of two Andean Cats in 100 km². More recent estimates based on systematic camera trapping resulted in 7-12 Andean Cats in 100 km² in northwestern Argentina (Reppucci <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2011) and in central western Bolivia, a preliminary estimate of 1.8 Andean cats in 100 km² was calculated by dividing the minimun number of identified Andean Cats by the area covered (164 km²) (Huaranca <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2013). In the last two studies, densities of sympatric Pampas Cats were also estimated, resulting 74-79 Pampas Cats in 100 km² in Argentina and 4.9 Pampas Cats in 100 km² in Bolivia. Reppucci <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. (2011) also estimated the detection probabilities for both species, which were higher for Andean Cat (0.07) than Pampas Cat (0.02). Other studies based mainly on faecal sample collection have found records of the Pampas Cat much more frequently than the Andean Cat (Lucherini and Vidal 2003, Perovic <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2003, Cossios <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2007, Viscarra 2008, Torrico 2009, Novaro <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2010, Villalba <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2012). All this information confirms that the Andean Cat is much rarer than the Pampas Cat.<br/> <br/> The three surveyed areas outlined above are located within the two regions that are considered to have the most favourable climatic conditions for Andean Cat, and that coincide with those places where a larger number of Andean Cat records have been obtained (Marino<span class=""apple-converted-space""> <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2011). In this context, it is expected that Andean Cat density in those areas with less favourable conditions will be much lower.<br/> <br/> A study of the population genetics of the Andean cat throughout most of its range (Cossios<span class=""apple-converted-space""> <em>et al</em>. 2012) indicated that the species has a very low mitochondrial and nuclear genetic diversity and two distinct Andean Cat subpopulations,which are latitudinally separated between 26 and 35° S,<span class=""apple-converted-space""> <span class=""apple-converted-space"">were identified that should be considered as two ""Evolutionary Significant Units” (ESUs). Moreover, the northern ESU contains two genetically different groups, showing limited or no exchange of individuals between them, which should be considered as two ""Management Units” (MUs).<br/> <br/> The geographical separation between the northern and southern ESU concurs with the third biogeographic barrier, the South American Arid Diagonal and the separation between the two northern management units coincides with the transition zone between the wet and dry Puna (Cossíos <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em><span class=""apple-converted-space""><em> </em>2012); thus, the authors remark that these three groups of Andean Cat populations could have developed special adaptations because significant differences exist in rainfall patterns over this range.<br/> </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Andean Cat has a patchy distribution due to a specialization for naturally fragmented rocky habitats and most presence records are from the central Andes above 3,600 meters in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and Peru. However it has also been found at lower elevations in the southern Andes of Argentina at 1,800 m (Sorli<span class=""apple-converted-space""> <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2006) and more recent records of the Andean Cat in Argentina and Chile extend its distribution range to the south and outside the Andes, into Patagonian steppe and scrub habitats in Argentina, at elevations as low as 650 m (Novaro <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2010, Martinez <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2008), and at 2,200 m in Chile in the Atacama Region (Villalobos<em> et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. in prep.).<br/> <br/> Within the high Andes the Andean Cat was recorded at an average elevation of 4,236 m in Argentina (Perovic<span class=""apple-converted-space""> <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em><span class=""apple-converted-space""> 2003), above 3,800 m in Bolivia (Villalba <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2012), between 3,714 and 4,414 m in Chile (Napolitano <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2008), and at 4,000 m or higher in Peru (Cossios <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2007).<br/> <br/> Until the end of the nineties, Andean Cat records were scarce and restricted to southern Peru, southwest Bolivia, northwest Argentina and northern Chile (Yensen and Seymour 2000). Similarly, sightings of this species were very few (Scrocchi and Halloy 1986, Sanderson 1999), and museum specimens were equally few (Garcia-Perea 2002). However in the last two decades the number of distribution records has greatly increased due to the efforts of the Andean Cat Alliance (<a href=""http://www.gatoandino.org"">www.gatoandino.org</a>), a network of specialist researchers.<br/> <br/> Currently the known northern and southern limit for the Andean cat respectively is central Peru (10°13'S), and central Argentina (38°23'S) (Cossios<span class=""apple-converted-space""> <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2007, Novaro <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2010), but throughout this range the Andean Cat populations are patchily distributed. The results of modelling the Andean Cat distribution considering four bioclimatic variables (annual mean and mean diurnal range temperature, annual precipitation, and coldest season winter), shows the presence of three biogeographic barriers that affect the species’ distribution: i) at the north in Peru that coincides with the Huancabamba depression, known as “Peruvian low” and defines the northern boundary of its distribution range, ii) at the centre in Bolivia, with the “Andean knee”, an extremely arid transition zone between the wet and dry Puna and where there are no records of Andean cats, and iii) at the south with the “Arid Diagonal” in Chile and Argentina, that is also an hyper-arid zone and with very few records of Andean Cats (Marino <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2011).<br/> <br/> According to this model and despite the differences in elevation over the current geographic range of the Andean Cat, there are common climatic conditions that favour for their presence, which are cold, dry and extreme diurnal variations in temperature (Marino <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em><span class=""apple-converted-space""><em> </em>2011).<br/> </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span lang=""EN-US""></span></p>","In Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and Perú people of Aymara origin, and in some cases Quechua, have similar beliefs regarding the Andean Cat and Pampas Cat (both known as titi or osqollo). A common tradition is the use of a skin or a stuffed cat during ceremonies that people perform for marking their domestic livestock, mainly llamas or alpacas; the titi is considered a sacred animal related with abundance and fertility of the livestock or quality of crops. It is important to note that both the Andean Cat and Pampas Cat are part of these traditions and beliefs, and in general, are used indiscriminately. There are some local variations within and between countries and in some cases the influence of western culture has resulted in a total or partial loss of the values of Andean cultures and the distortion of ancestral customs regarding the titi (Villalba <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/>Cossios&#160;<em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. (2007) also reported the hunting of Andean and Pampas Cats for food and for traditional medicine in central Peru.",Terrestrial,"<p>Included on CITES Appendix I (as<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>Leopardus jacobitus</em>).

However, law enforcement is problematic, and hunted specimens are regularly observed in the field and for sale, although with less frequency than before, in special markets to be used in religious ceremonies.<br/> <br/> After developing the actions outlined in the Andean Cat Conservation Action Plan (Villalba<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004) and the information generated in the last 10 years, the Andean Cat Alliance elaborated the Strategic Plan for Andean Cat Conservation (AGA 2011) with the following objectives and maintaining the three main lines of action: Research, Education and Conservation:<br/> <br/> a.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; To ensure long-term conservation of the Andean Cat and its natural environment, including the restoration or rehabilitation of the environments that have suffered degradation.<br/> <br/> b.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; To integrate the conservation of the Andean Cat and its natural environment within local policies in the four countries where the species is present, working locally but with a global approach.<br/> <br/> c.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; To strengthen activities of conservation and research in protected areas with Andean Cat populations, and to promote the creation or extension of existing protected areas to provide connectivity and/or protection of habitats and Andean cat populations.<br/> <br/> d.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; To promote research on the conservation threats, ecological requirements of the species, its principal prey, and other sympatric carnivores.<br/> <br/> e.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; To standardize the activities of working groups under common and more effective goals.<br/> <br/> f.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; To train protected areas staff and local communities in activities in research, education and conservation, within and outside protected areas.<br/> <br/> The Andean Cat is found in several protected areas across its range and some were prioritized for promoting effective conservation of the species as well as their habitats and others for the need to carry out surveys and promote effective conservation actions.<br/> <br/> Mining and oil/gas extraction are a priority economic activity in South American countries, even in protected areas, therefore lobbying with authorities and the industry sector, as well as promoting and/or supporting the implementation of mitigation plans to minimize impacts are fundamental actions to be addressed (Walker<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>Similarly, community-based conservation is an essential approach that is being implemented by promoting or supporting sustainable economic initiatives, favouring better practices in livestock management or other activities oriented to mitigate human-wildlife conflict. Community education and support for law enforcement are also important activities to minimize or stop Andean Cat hunting and encourage positive attitudes towards Andean cats and high Andean biodiversity.<br/><br/><strong> National legislation</strong><br/> <br/> <u>Argentina</u><br/> The Andean Cat is protected by National Law 22421 of wildlife conservation and its Statutory<br/> Decree 666/97.

50659951,15955,Panthera tigris,Endangered,A2abcd; C1,2015,2014-04-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Tiger is listed as Endangered under criterion A2abcd. Comparing a breeding recent range estimate (42 “source sites” totalling 90,000&#160; km² : Walston <em>et al</em>. 2010b) to a 2006 total range estimate (1.1 million km² : Dinerstein <em>et al</em>. 2007) suggests a range decline much greater than 50% over the last three generations (7 x 3 = 21 years). As per IUCN guidelines (Nowell <em>et al</em>. 2007, IUCN 2013), we calculated generation length at seven years based on approximate age of maturity (four years) plus half the length of the reproductive lifespan (six years) (based on Smith and McDougal 1991 and unpublished information). This decline continues and at least two of the source populations listed in Walston <em>et al</em>. (2010b) have apparently been lost (one from Lao PDR and one from Thailand). In 2006, it was believed that breeding populations existed in 13 countries, but now known breeding Tiger populations occur only in eight (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nepal, Thailand and Russia).<br/><br/>In 1998, the global Tiger population was estimated at 5,000 to 7,000 Tigers (Seidensticker <em>et al</em>. 1999). A comparison of these population estimates of the 1990s (many with little scientific rigour) to similar current ones (many of better quality; see Table 1 in attached Supporting Material) suggests a decline of about 50% (taking the upper bound of 7,000 as the number of mature individuals in 1993, using a precautionary approach, declining to approximately 3,500 in 2014), but differences in methodologies and accuracy make such comparisons uncertain. This declining trend is likely to persist in the face of continuing threats such as direct poaching, prey depletion and habitat degradation which continue in all range states. Although several sites in India and Nepal have indeed reported recent recoveries, population reductions may not be reversible in other areas where Tiger habitat itself has been lost. Given the uncertainties about future declines, criterion A4bcd is no longer used.<br/><br/>The Tiger is also listed as Endangered under criterion C1 because the population of mature individuals may be fewer than 2,500 individuals. Walston <em>et al</em>. 2010a estimated 2,154 tigers in 42 protected source sites where there is evidence of breeding (two populations are since known to have been lost, as described above), and the numbers in Table 1 (see Supporting material) could be overestimated. Generally Tiger status outside the source sites is poor and large breeding populations are unlikely to exist. To ensure tiger persistence, large population sizes (implying highest possible densities) and high survival rates of breeding adult females are critical. Although well-protected tiger populations may achieve recruitment rates that can sustain annual losses from mortality and emigration of 20% or more (Karanth <em>et al</em>. 2006), some theoretical models suggest declines to extinction when annual mortality of breeding females exceeds 15% (Chapron <em>et al</em>. 2008). Population declines in recent years have been most pronounced outside protected areas (Walston <em>et al</em>. 2010b). For the purposes of Red List assessment, the estimated population in Source Sites is a good proxy for the breeding population of adult Tigers. This population has declined by over 20% during the last two generations (14 years); the decline continues and may not be reversible in all sites.<br/><br/>Previously, Tigers were also listed under criterion C2a(i), but we have removed this criterion because the population in the Western Ghats in India has increased to &gt;250 adults (Karanth unpublished data). Other subpopulations in Terai, Central India, and Russia may also have &gt;250 adults (Karanth <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>See attached Supporting Material for alternative depictions of range and population details.","Tigers are found mainly in the forests of tropical Asia, although they historically occurred more widely in drier and colder climes. One subspecies, the Amur Tiger <em>P. t. altaica</em>, persists in the Russian Far East. Photos of Tigers up to 4,500 m have been obtained in Bhutan (Wang 2008).<br/><br/>Availability of a sufficient prey base of large ungulates is the Tiger's major habitat requirement: ""wild pigs and deer of various species are the two prey types that make up the bulk of the Tiger's diet, and in general Tigers require a good population of these species in order to survive and reproduce"" (Hayward <em>et al</em>. 2012, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Tigers need to kill 50-60 large prey animals per year (Karanth <em>et al</em>. 2004, Miller <em>et al</em>. 2013). Tigers are opportunistic predators, however, and their diet includes birds, fish, rodents, insects, amphibians, reptiles in addition to other mammals such as primates and porcupines. Tigers can also take ungulate prey much larger than themselves, including large bovids (Water Buffalo, Gaur, Banteng), elephants and rhinos (Nowell and Jackson 1996). However, like many large carnivores, preferred prey are key to successful reproduction and are those species that are approximately the same weight as Tigers themselves (Hayward <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Tigers are generally solitary, with adults maintaining exclusive territories, or home ranges. Adult female home ranges seldom overlap, whereas male ranges typically overlap from 1–3 females, a common felid pattern of social organization. Tiger home ranges are small where prey is abundant - e.g., female home ranges in Chitwan averaged 20 km², while in the Russian Far East they are much larger at about 400 km² (Goodrich <em>et al</em>. 2010, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Similarly, reported Tiger densities range from a maximum of 17-19 Tigers per 100 km² where prey are abundant (India's Kaziranga and Corbett National Parks) to as low as 0.13–0.45 per 100 km² where prey is more thinly distributed, as in Russia's Sikhote Alin Mountains (Jhala <em>et al</em>. 2011, Soutyrina <em>et al</em>. 2012).","Poaching for illegal trade in high-value Tiger products including skins, bones, meat and tonics is a primary threat to Tigers, which has led to their recent disappearance from broad areas of otherwise suitable habitat, and continues at unsustainable rates. That there are roughly one million square kilometres of unoccupied Tiger habitat is a clear indication that poaching is the greatest threat to Tigers range-wide.<br/><br/>Asia is a densely populated and rapidly developing region, bringing huge pressures to bear on the large wild areas required for viable Tiger populations. Conversion of forest land to agriculture and silviculture, commercial logging, and human settlement are the main drivers of Tiger habitat loss. With their substantial dietary requirements, Tigers require a healthy large ungulate prey base, but these species are also under heavy human subsistence hunting pressure and competition from domestic livestock.<br/><br/>Tiger attacks on livestock and people can lead to intolerance of Tigers by neighbouring communities and presents an ongoing challenge to managers to build local support for Tiger conservation and can lead to high rates of retaliatory killing of Tigers. In some areas there have been many human deaths - for example, about 40 people were killed by Tigers in the Sundarbans mangrove forest of Bangladesh and India 2000-2010 (Barlow <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><p>&#160;</p>  <p>&#160;</p>","The thirteen Tiger Range Countries came together in an unprecedented pledge to double the world’s Tiger population by 2022, the next Year of the Tiger on the Asian lunar calendar, with a goal of achieving at least 6,000 Tigers. This figure was based on a baseline global population of 3,200, agreed upon at a preparatory workshop held in Kathmandu, Nepal in October 2009; 3,200 Tigers was the IUCN Red List population estimate at that time. Since then, Tiger Range Countries have adjusted their baseline national Tiger estimates, finalized in the Global Tiger Recovery Program adopted at the International Tiger Forum in St Petersburg, Russia in November 2010 (GTRP 2010).<br/><br/>The global Tiger estimate published in the 2010 Red List assessment of 2,154 tigers was an updated version of the estimate of Tiger numbers in source sites (Walston <em>et al</em>. 2010a). This was not a complete estimate of global Tiger numbers (for example, most Amur Tigers in Russia are found in unprotected areas), but justified because Tiger status outside the source sites is generally poor and poorly known. IUCN Guidelines (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2010) define population as the number of mature individuals, defined as “individuals known, estimated or inferred to be capable of reproduction.” While in general this refers to all reproductive-age adults in the population, the Guidelines also “stress that the intention of the definition of mature individuals is to allow the estimate of the number of mature individuals to take account of all the factors that may make a taxon more vulnerable than otherwise might be expected.” Tigers require large populations to persist, and the survival rate of breeding adult females is a key parameter, with models suggesting population declines when mortality of breeding females rises over 15% (Chapron <em>et al</em>. 2008). Population declines in recent years have been most pronounced outside protected areas (Walston <em>et al</em>. 2010b). The IUCN Guidelines advise that “mature individuals that will never produce new recruits should not be counted.” Thus, for the purposes of the Red List assessment in 2010, the estimated population in the Source Sites was used as a proxy for the breeding population of adult Tigers.<br/><br/>Due to extensive surveys using improved methodologies since this analysis, our understanding of tiger distribution and numbers is much improved, e.g., extensive camera trapping in Bhutan has demonstrated significant populations. Further, Walston <em>et al</em>. (2010a) ignored some important Tiger areas, e.g., thousands of square kilometres in Kerinci and Leuser National Parks known to contain breeding Tiger populations.&#160; Hence, the current estimate of 3,159 Tigers (Table 1 in supplementary material) is based on data collected in scientific surveys conducted over the past five years (i.e. since 2009). This is a minimum estimate because some important areas (e.g. the Russian Far East) did not have current estimates. However, because of differences in methodology, this can by no means be interpreted as an increase over the 2010 estimate of 2,154. Rather, it is a more complete counting. While Tiger numbers have increased in some areas in India (e.g. Western Ghats, Central India, and Corbett Landscapes in India), they have also declined in key areas, especially in mainland SE Asia (e.g. Nam Et-Phou Louey in Lao PDR is no longer considered a potential source site).<br/><br/>In 1998, the global Tiger population was estimated, less rigorously, at 5,000 to 7,000 Tigers (Seidensticker <em>et al</em>. 1999). Although to some extent the new numbers represent improved knowledge, it is clear that there have been substantial population declines, with Tigers all but eliminated from much of their recent forest range, particularly in Southeast Asia.<br/><br/>See the supplementary material for further information about national Tiger population estimates.",Decreasing,"The Tiger once ranged widely across Asia, from Turkey in the west to the eastern coast of Russia (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Over the past 100 years Tigers have disappeared from southwest and central Asia, from two Indonesian islands (Java and Bali) and from large areas of Southeast and Eastern Asia. Tigers inhabit less than 6% of their historic range (Sanderson <em>et al</em>. 2006, Walston <em>et al.</em> 2010b), with a 42% decline since 2006. Breeding populations of Tigers are currently found in eight range states: Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nepal, Russia, and Thailand. There is evidence of breeding in China and Myanmar between 2009 and 2014, though these populations are likely dependent on immigration from neighbouring countries. Tigers may still persist in North Korea, although there has been no recent confirmed evidence.<br/><br/>In 1994, the first comprehensive assessment to delineate Tiger range was carried out (Dinerstein <em>et al</em>. 1997). Priority areas for Tiger conservation were estimated to total 1.64 million km² in 159 Tiger Conservation Units (TCUs), roughly equivalent to discrete meta-populations, not including Russia (later estimated at 270,0000 km²: Sanderson <em>et al</em>. 2006) and China. While this was generally considered representative of current distribution, Tiger presence was confirmed in just 47% the TCUs, and 89% were scored as undergoing medium to high levels of poaching of Tigers and their prey.<br/><br/>This exercise was revised and updated ten years later, and in delineating Tiger Conservation Landscapes (TCLs), greater emphasis was placed on actual records of Tiger presence and breeding (Sanderson <em>et al</em>. 2006). TCLs were defined as areas where there is sufficient habitat to conserve at least five Tigers, and Tigers have been confirmed to occur in the past decade. Tiger range was estimated at 1.1 million km² in 76 TCLs (again, roughly equivalent to discrete meta-populations). This represented a 41% decline from the range described a decade earlier (in South and Southeast Asia, a drop from 1.55 million km² to 914,000 km²: Sanderson <em>et al</em>. 2006: 63), attributed primarily to poaching pressure (Dinerstein <em>et al</em>. 2007). Habitat loss due to deforestation was also to blame, notable particularly in Sumatra and Myanmar (Wikramanayake <em>et al</em>. 2010). In India, landscapes with Tigers found to be much smaller and more fragmented than in the original assessment (Sanderson <em>et al</em>. 2006: 63 and Figure 4.12).<br/><br/>Records of Tigers were collected over a ten-year period (1995–2004), a period which may have been too liberal for places like Cambodia which underwent a sharp rise in poaching pressure in the 1990s (Sanderson <em>et al</em>. 2006: Appendix 6). While 53% of the TCU survey respondents reported evidence of Tiger breeding in the time period 1995–2004, out of over 2,500 point records collected in 2005, just 8% had confirmed evidence of breeding Tigers (Sanderson <em>et al</em>. 2006: 11-17). Large areas of habitat were defined as Tiger landscapes based on suitability, but given data paucity on Tiger presence there were often few records of breeding and actual Tiger occupancy to substantiate these (Sanderson <em>et al</em>. 2006: Figures 2.3 and 4.8).<br/><br/>A review of land management within Tiger Conservation Landscapes described the TCLs as “potential habitat for Tigers” and found only 21% of their area to be legally protected.&#160; Management effectiveness was generally poor in the protected areas, with regulatory, budgetary and enforcement constraints, and hunting cited as the main threat. Significant portions of the TCLs are designated concessions for resource extraction (timber, oil and gas, minerals, etc.) (Forrest <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>Tiger range was revisited again in 2009, by which time the extent of the Tiger’s range collapse had become evident. “Vast areas of Southeast Asia [were] recently found to be void of Tigers and depleted of prey by hunters” (Walston <em>et al</em>. 2010a: 5). The exercise used a different methodology to prioritize areas for Tiger conservation.&#160; Source Sites were defined as areas with confirmed current presence of Tigers and evidence of breeding, population estimates of &gt;25 breeding females, legal protection, and embedded in a larger habitat landscape with the potential to hold &gt;50 breeding females. An extensive review of scientific literature as well as correspondence with Tiger scientists and protected area managers resulted in the identification of just 42 source sites totalling approximately 90,000 km².&#160; Many Southeast Asian countries, previously considered to have large areas with Tigers, were found, on the basis of extensive survey effort over the past decade or more, to have no healthy breeding populations. Since this publication, Lao PDR has lost its only source site, but Bhutan, originally listed as a country not containing source sites, has documented breeding populations. [See Figures 1 and 2 in supplementary material].<br/><br/>The map for this effort (Figure 1 in supplementary material) differentiates areas where breeding has been detected in the past five years (2009-2014), where Tigers, but no breeding have been detected in the past five years, areas surveyed where no Tigers were detected and areas not surveyed.&#160; Data include camera trap photos, DNA, and observations of Tigers and Tiger sign detected during scientific surveys.&#160; Unsurveyed areas were excluded from Tiger range.&#160; Figure 2 (attached Supporting Material)&#160; documents a 42% range decline since 2006, reflecting both real decline and improved knowledge from new and better surveys.","In the early 1990s, it was feared that poaching of Tigers for the use of their bones in traditional Asian medicine would drive the Tiger to extinction (Nowell 2000). Despite strong international action to eliminate it, illegal trade persists (Nowell 2007). Tiger bone has long been considered to hold anti-inflammatory properties, with some support from Chinese medical research, but many consider the effect to be more psychological than pharmacological (Nowell and Xu 2007). Although all countries have banned use and manufacture of Tiger bone, illegal production persists in several Asian countries, especially in China, Malaysia, and Viet Nam (Nowell 2007). In China there are several operations engaged in intensive breeding (""farming"" of Tigers), with the captive population reportedly reaching over 6,000. They are pressuring the government to allow them to produce Tiger products, and several have already engaged in illegal production of Tiger bone wine. Market surveys indicate that medicinal use of Tiger bone has decreased since China banned Tiger bone in 1993. Tiger farming perpetuates and threatens to re-ignite consumer demand (Nowell and Xu 2007). In 2008 the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) adopted a Decision stating that “Tigers should not be bred for trade in their parts and derivatives” (CITES 2008).<br/><br/>There are other illegal markets for Tiger products, especially skins, but also teeth and claws (particularly in Sumatra: Ng and Nemora 2007), contributing to poaching pressure. But many Tigers are also killed by people seeking to protect life and livestock. Conflict-killed Tigers can also feed into the illegal trade. Many Tiger products in trade are faked, a legal ""grey area"" in several countries which also perpetuates consumer demand (Nowell 2000).<br/><br/>Tiger poaching is driven by less by poverty and more by wealth (TRAFFIC 2008), which is putting expensive illegal Tiger products within reach of a rapidly growing group of potential consumers. TRAFFIC has documented rising levels of recent illegal trade within the Tiger range countries, with seizures and confiscations in 2007–2009 averaging the equivalent of approximately 150 Tigers per year (Verheij <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010). Interdictions represent just a fraction of the true level of illegal trade, indicating that Tigers are gravely imperilled by black market demand.",Terrestrial,"At a “Tiger Summit” held in St Petersburg, Russia in November 2010, the 13 Tiger Range Countries adopted a Global Tiger Recovery Program (GTRP 2010). The goal is to effectively double the number of wild Tigers by 2022 through actions to: <br/>i) effectively preserve, manage, enhance and protect Tiger habitats; <br/>ii) eradicate poaching, smuggling and illegal trade of Tigers, their parts and derivatives; <br/>iii) cooperate in transboundary landscape management and in combating illegal trade; <br/>iv) engage with indigenous and local communities; <br/>v) increase the effectiveness of Tiger and habitat management; and <br/>vi) restore Tigers to their former range. <br/><br/>The Tiger Summit was attended by Heads of State including Russia, China, Lao PDR, Nepal and Bangladesh, and represented significant government commitment to Tiger conservation.<br/><br/>The future of Tiger range depends upon the Asian governments creating effective Tiger landscapes by conserving large areas of suitable habitat. Within these landscapes, the most urgent need is to first secure the source sites—protected areas with viable Tiger populations—where most of the global Tiger population is now clustered, and many of which are currently too threatened to deliver their potential as the demographic sources for species recovery (Walston <em>et al</em>. 2010b).<br/><br/>Countries that do not currently support known breeding populations (Myanmar, Cambodia, Viet Nam and Lao PDR) but still have large landscapes with suitable habitat, Tigers might still be recovered if government commitment to Tigers, staff capacity for law enforcement and legal frameworks for Tiger protection can be established (Lynam 2010), though reintroduction may be needed in some places.",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
50661611,18146,Prionailurus bengalensis,Least Concern,,2015,2014-05-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Leopard Cat is a widespread and relatively common species (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002), although the island subspecies <em>P. b. iriomotensis </em>is assessed separately in the Red List because the population is small and isolated.&#160; Across its range, threats vary enormously by region, in the Western Ghats in India, for example, it is threatened by urbanisation (Seto <em>et al.</em> 2012), while in Viet Nam (Wilcox <em>et al.</em> 2014) and Lao PDR (Coudrat <em>et al.</em> 2014ab) direct and indirect hunting are potentially causing large population declines. Across the majority of its range, however, this species appears to be stable and to readily use degraded forest (e.g. Mohamed <em>et al.</em> 2013) and even heavily modified habitats such as oil palm (Hearn, Ross and Macdonald unpublished data, Yue <em>et al.</em> in press) and sugar cane plantations (Lorica and Heaney 2013). Consequently the Leopard Cat does not currently meet the criteria for any of the threatened categories. It is listed as Least Concern.","Leopard Cats can range up to 3,240 m asl (Ghimirey and Ghimire 2010) and occur in a wide variety of habitats from tropical rainforest to temperate broadleaf and, marginally, coniferous forest, as well as shrub forest and successional grasslands. The northern boundary of its range is limited by snow cover, as the Leopard Cat does not occur in deep snow (but see Kerley and Bosienko 2013). It is not found in the cold steppe grasslands, and generally does not occur in arid, treeless areas (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).<br/><br/>Leopard Cats occur commonly in dense secondary growth, including logged forest (Ross&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010,&#160;Mohamed <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013) and have been found in Acacia (Giman <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007), oil palm (Ross&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010,&#160;Yue <em><em>et al.</em></em> in press, Hearn, Ross and Macdonald unpublished data) and sugarcane (Lorica and Heaney 2013) plantations. A camera trap study in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo found that both number of individuals and overall detections of Leopard Cats were higher in a small oil palm plantation with shorter distances to the nearest forest compared to a large plantation, suggesting that although Leopard Cats do use oil palm areas, forest habitat remains important (Hearn, Ross and Macdonald, unpublished data). It is still unknown how dependent Leopard Cats in oil palm plantations are on surrounding forest, or the maximum distances they will move into plantations, or even if plantations support stable populations. Leopard Cats can also live close to rural settlements. They are excellent swimmers, and have successfully colonized offshore islands throughout their range (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).<br/><br/>From 20 radio-collared Leopard Cats in Phu Khieu Wildlife Sanctuary, Thailand, Grassman <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2005) report mean home ranges of 12.7 km<sup>2</sup>, larger than that reported for other radio-collared Leopard Cats in Thailand (4.5&#160;km<sup>2</sup>;&#160;Grassman <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005) or on Borneo (roughly 3.0&#160;km<sup>2</sup>;&#160;Rajaratnam 2007, Hearn and Ross, unpublished data) or Iriomote Island (Schmidt <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003). Grassman <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2005) found no significant difference between the range sizes of males and females. They also found that habitat use was in proportion to occurrence. Rajaratnam <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2007) report that Leopard Cats used oil palm plantations for hunting but forest fragments were important for resting and breeding. This was also seen in Sumatra, where Leopard Cats have been frequently recorded in remnant forest fragments in and amongst coffee plantations (McCarthy, unpublished data).<br/><br/>Murids have been shown to dominate the diet (Rabinowitz 1990, Grassman <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005, Rajaratnam <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007, Shehzad <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012). Other small mammals, eels and fish have also been reported, as well as occasional scavenging of carrion (Nowell and Jackson 1996).<br/><br/>The Leopard Cat is predominantly nocturnal (Grassman <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005, Cheyne and Macdonald 2011, Lynam <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013, McCarthy <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015, Hearn, Ross and Macdonald, unpublished data), with crepuscular peaks in some areas (Grassman <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005) but some diurnal activity has been recorded (e.g. Saxena and Rajanshi 2014, Hearn, Ross and Macdonald unpublished data).","In China, commercial exploitation has been heavy: hundreds of thousands of Leopard Cat skins per year were exported in the 1980s. Although commercial trade is now much reduced (Yu 2010) this species continues to be hunted throughout most of its range for fur, for food and as pets. They are also widely viewed as poultry pests and killed in retribution. In villages around Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park on Sumatra, chicken depredation was frequently attributed to Leopard Cats, and commonly resulted in retribution killing of the species (McCarthy 2013). Island populations are small and seriously threatened in the Philippines and Japan. Leopard Cats can hybridize with domestic cats, as is shown by the popular domestic breed, the Bengal Cat although most of these exotic cats are now bred from Bengal Cat stock rather than wild crosses (TICA, The International Cat Association 2012). Hybridization in the wild has been reported, but is not considered a significant threat. Although this species is less dependent on forest cover than others, habitat loss and fragmentation is still a threat across most of its range (Nowell and Jackson 1996).","Mohamed <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2013) report population densities of 9.6, 12.4 and 16.5 individuals/100 km<sup>2</sup>, from three selectively logged forest reserves in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. They also found that population density increased with forest disturbance. A similar relationship with forest disturbance was found in the Western Ghats, India, but densities here were generally lower at 10.45 and 4.48 individuals/100&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;from Badhra and Biligiri Rangaswamy Temple Tiger Reserves, respectively (Srivathsa <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015). Across most of its range the Leopard Cat is recorded more frequently than sympatric cats (e.g. Nowell and Jackson 1996, Duckworth <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1999, Holden 2001, Duckworth <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005, Lynam <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006, Yasuda <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2007, Gumal <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014), especially in disturbed areas such as logging concessions (e.g. Ross <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010, Mohamed <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013), however, in some surveys leopard cats are recorded less frequently than other species (e.g. Pusparini <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014, McCarthy <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015, Loken <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> unpublished data), particularly in areas of primary forest (e.g. Ross <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010, McCarthy <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015, Hearn, Ross and Macdonald unpublished data). Leopard Cats have also been detected in oil palm plantations (Ross <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010, Rajaratnam <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2007, Yue <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> in press), however, fewer individual Leopard Cats were detected, and the detection rate was lower, in a survey of a large oil palm plantation, located at a greater distance from natural or semi-natural vegetation, compared to a smaller plantation, located close to natural vegetation, (Hearn, Ross and Macdonald unpublished data), suggesting that proximity to surrounding forest remains an important factor.<br/><br/>With a wide distribution and tolerance to human modified landscapes the Leopard Cat’s population is abundant. However, it is not invulnerable to habitat loss and degradation and this, coupled with hunting, is likely causing population declines in some regions (e.g. Seto <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2012, Wilcox <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014, Coudrat <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014a, Coudrat <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014b). In the late 1980s on average 200,000 Leopard Cat skins were exported from China (Nowell and Jackson 1996), although the actual harvest was likely much higher, possibly up to 400,000 (Yu 2010). Although the Leopard Cat is more tolerant to habitat disturbance than sympatric felids it likely experiences higher mortality rates in these areas (e.g. Rajaratnam 2000). Haines <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2004) report survival rates of 92% in a protected area compared with only 53-82% in areas with higher human activity. <br/><br/>Island populations are particularly at risk of extinction, with the Iriomote Cat <em>P.b. iriomotensis</em> listed as Critically Endangered, and the Visayan Leopard Cat <em>P.b. rabori</em> of the Philippine islands of Panay, Negros, Cebu and possibly Masbate listed as Vulnerable. The small population (approximately 100) on Japan's 710 km<sup>2</sup> Tsushima Island, considered the same subspecies as that which occurs in northeast mainland Asia, has decreased over the last 30-40 years (Izawa <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2007). The population of the Western Ghats, India is geographically isolated due to a climate barrier and should be managed as a discrete conservation unit (Mukherjee <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010).",Stable,"The Leopard Cat is a widespread species. It is found through parts of India, west into Pakistan and Afghanistan (Habibi 2003), through the Himalayan foothills, throughout most of China, and north to the Korean peninsula and into the Russian Far East (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Its range extends south throughout Southeast Asia, and includes the islands of Sumatra, Java, Borneo and Taiwan. The Leopard Cat is found on numerous small offshore islands of mainland Asia (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). It is the only wild felid in Japan, where it occurs on the small islands of Tsushima and Iriomote, and the Philippines, where it occurs on the islands of Palawan, Panay, Negros and Cebu, there are unconfirmed reports from Masbate but it is presumed to be extinct on Guimaras.<br/><br/>There are many recent records from protected and non-protected areas throughout its range examples include Borneo: Danum Valley Conservation Area and surrounding production forest, Tabin Wildlife Reserve, Crocker Range National Park, Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary, Kabili-Sepilok and Gomantong Forest Reserves, and Tawau Hills National Park (Hearn, Ross and Macdonald, unpublished data), Maliau Basin Conservation Area (Brodie and Giordano 2011), Deramakot Forest Reserve (Mohamed <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em>&#160;2009), Sabangau National Park (Cheyne and Macdonald 2011), Wehea Forest (Loken <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> unpublished data), Upper Baram region of Sarawak (Mathai <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010), Sumatra: Gunung Leuser National Park (Pusparini <em><em><em><em>et al.&#160;</em></em></em></em>2014), Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park (McCarthy <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2015), Singapore: Pulau Tekong (Chua 2013), Peninsular Malaysia: Endau Rompin National Park (Gumal <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014), Cambodia: Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary (Gray <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014), Myanmar: Taninthary Nature Reserve and Hlawga Park (Than <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014), Thailand: Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary (Simcharoen <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014) Thung Yai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuary (Tantipisanuh <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014), Lao PDR: Nakai-Nam Theun National Protected Area (Coudrat <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014a), Nepal: Chitwan National Park (Lamichhane <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014), Makalu-Barun National Park (Ghimirey and Ghimire 2010), India: Radhanagari Wildlife Sanctuary (Punjabi <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em>&#160;2014), Rajaji National Park (Saxena and Rajvanshi 2014), Bhutan: Royal Manas National Park (Tempa <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013), China: Wanglang National Nature Reserve (Yu 2010), Russia: Zov Tigra National Park (Kerley and Borisenko 2013).<br/><br/>The range map of the current assessment is based on known localities, coupled with habitat (Hansen 2013), molecular and climatic data (Mukherjee <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010).","Leopard Cat skins are commercially traded internationally for the fur trade, primarily coats. Skins are also used as decorations in some parts of its range. Leopard Cats are occasionally kept as pets, sometimes taken from the wild and sometimes from captive breeding and they have been interbred with domestic cats, particularly in the West, to make the popular Bengal breed.

Data on the extent of African Golden Cat AOO loss is unavailable due to a lack of population monitoring. We can infer, however, an approximate AOO loss using data on deforestation and bushmeat hunting, as well as evidence of the effects of these on African Golden Cats.<br/><br/>We infer that the cumulative loss of AOO from deforestation and bushmeat hunting along expanding road networks amounts to &gt;30% in the past 15 years (three Golden Cat generations; Pacifici <em>et al</em>. 2013) and qualifies the African Golden Cat for Vulnerable status under criterion A2c. Additionally, the exacerbation of these threats due to population growth, projected mining activities and forest clearance for oil palm plantations will likely cause further reduction in AOO for the Golden Cat and we therefore predict that the AOO will be reduced by at least a further 30% in the next 15 years, lending additional support to the species’ listing as Vulnerable under criterion A3c.<br/><p></p>","While the Neotropical and Indomalayan regions have several sympatric forest-dependent felid species, this is Africa's only one.  The African Golden Cat occurs mainly in primary moist equatorial forest, although on the periphery of its range it penetrates savanna regions along riverine forest.  It also occurs in montane forest and alpine moorland in the east of its range (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Ray and Butynski 2013). &#160;<br/><br/>Two studies of scats - from the Ituri forest of the Congo (Hart <em>et al.</em> 1996) and the Dzanga-Sangha forest of the Central African republic (Ray and Sunquist 2001) - found similar results.  Rodents and squirrels were the main prey item (70 % and 62% respectively), followed by small and medium-size duikers (antelopes) (25% and 33% respectively.  Primates made up 5% of the prey items in both studies, and there have been several observations by primate researchers of African Golden Cats hunting arboreal primates (Ray and Butynski 2013, Bahaa-el-din <em>et al. </em>in review).  The same general diet items were reported by Kingdon (1977) from Uganda's Bwindi National Park.  Birds are also taken, and pangolin remains were frequently found in scats from the Ivory Coast's Tai National Park (D. Jenny pers. comm. in Nowell and Jackson 1996). <br/><br/>African Golden Cats have turned up in the diet of leopards, the only other felid to occur in African moist forest.  African Golden Cat remains were found in five of 196 Leopard <em>Panthera pardus</em> scats from Gabon's Lopé National Park (Henschel <em>et al.</em> 2005); a single carcass killed by a Leopard was found in the Ituri (Hart <em>et al.</em> 1996).","At least 6.5% of forest (projected from FAO 2011) in Golden Cat range countries has been lost in the past three Golden Cat generations (15 years, Pacifici <em>et al</em>. 2013). This translates into, at minimum, an equivalent loss of range for the Golden Cat as a result of habitat loss and fragmentation. Prior to the year 2000, West and East Africa had already suffered an 88-92% reduction in rainforest, while Central Africa’s rainforest extent was reduced by 40% (Laurance <em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><br/>Intensive hunting for bushmeat (&gt;1 million tonnes per year harvested in the Congo Basin, the species’ main stronghold; Wilkie and Carpenter 1999), leading to ‘empty forest syndrome’ (Sayer 1992), likely accounts for greater reduction in area of occupancy (AOO) for the Golden Cat than deforestation, but is more difficult to quantify. Within 10–15 km of roads and settlements, large and medium bodied mammals experience sharp declines in population (Laurance <em>et al</em>. 2006, Blake <em>et al.</em> 2007, Henschel 2008). In excess of 64% of forest habitat in the Congo Basin lies within 10 km of a road and is also predicted to be affected by higher hunting pressure (Blake <em>et al</em>. 2007). Development of roads increased rapidly in the past 15 years (e.g. 35% increase in the Democratic Republic of Congo and &gt;300% increase in northern Republic of Congo since the year 2000; Laporte <em>et al</em>. 2007). Golden Cat populations within these highly impacted areas are likely to be severely reduced or extirpated through direct mortality and loss of prey.<br/><br/>Golden cats are often not a primary target species, but are frequently killed by wire-snares (four individuals in two months in 20 km<sup>2</sup> in Gabon; Bahaa-el-din pers. obs.; and 13 individuals in three months in Lobéké, Cameroon; Ray <em>et al.</em> 2005), probably owing to similarities in body size and trail use to target species such as duikers. In an area of moderate bushmeat hunting, Golden Cats were recorded at less than a quarter of the population densities that they are found at in pristine areas (Bahaa-el-din <em>et al</em>. in prep). Where more intense hunting occurs, such as in village hunting areas (e.g. Dibouka village in central Gabon; Henschel 2008) and national parks (e.g. Korup NP in southwest Cameroon; TEAM, http://www.teamnetwork.org), camera trap and bushmeat studies did not record the species despite the presence of suitable habitat contiguous with the main forest of the Congo Basin.<br/><br/>Recent landscape-scale Golden Cat surveys in mainland Equatorial Guinea (Rio Muni) emphasize that prior range estimates based on forest cover may have significantly overestimated remaining golden cat range. An estimated 78% of Rio Muni consists of tropical dense forest and therefore putatively suitable habitat, but Golden Cats were found to occupy just 16% of the area (Martinez Marti 2011). Its presence in the area was correlated with rugged, inaccessible terrain away from human disturbance (Martinez Marti 2011). Golden Cats were reported by locals to be easy to hunt and locally extirpated long before other medium-to-large mammal species (Martinez Marti 2011).<br/><br/>These threats will intensify, as the human population within the species’ range shows the fastest growth rates in the world (+2.6-2.8% per annum for West, Central and East Africa; FAO 2011). The population in main Golden Cat range countries, estimated at nearly a quarter of a billion for 2013, is projected to almost quadruple by 2100 (UN 2012, <a href=""http:////esa.un.org/wpp/"">http://esa.un.org/wpp/</a>).<br/><br/>The current “stampede of foreign investment” in mining activities and associated infrastructure development in Africa is of immediate concern (Edwards <em>et al</em>. 2014). In Central Africa, 42% of ecologically important areas would be directly impacted if there were complete development of mineral resources in the region (assuming that ecological impacts extend within 10 km of mines; Edwards et al. 2014). China’s mineral investment alone has quadrupled in 10 years (Zhang 2011). In addition, it is predicted that the conversion of forests to oil palm plantations, which has caused extensive loss of forest habitat and biodiversity in Southeast Asia, will have similar impacts in Africa (particularly in West and Central Africa) as it expands over the coming years (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2014). The realisation of these investments includes habitat destruction and degradation, relocation of human populations into previously remote areas and massive-scale infrastructural development including road and rail which in turn lead to the aforementioned surge in bushmeat hunting in these areas (Edwards <em>et al</em>. 2014).","<p>The African Golden Cat is infrequently observed in the wild, and generally considered rare.

There have been five attempts to compile national estimates, of varying data quality, to determine global Snow Leopard global population size. Two sets contain estimates largely dating prior to 2003: 4,080-6,500 (McCarthy and Chapron 2003) and 3,920-6,390 (Snow Leopard Working Secretariat 2013). Two sets date from 2008-2010: 4,500-7,500 (Jackson <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010) and 4,678 to 8,745 (a compilation of individual population estimates for prime habitat covering about 1/3 of likely extant range developed at an expert mapping workshop in 2008 but not available until 2016: McCarthy <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2016). The most recent set of national estimates comes from country chapters in the comprehensive book <em>Snow Leopards</em>: 7,463 to 7,980 (McCarthy and Mallon 2016, Thinley <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2016: Table 1 in the Supporting Information). While all these sets of estimates exclude dependent cubs, a population modelling exercise was carried out in 2015 to exclude young adults which may not be capable of breeding (Appendix 2 in the Supporting Information). Model outputs for nine different scenarios were applied to the most conservative possible global population estimate available at the time (4,000), resulting in a number of mature individuals between 2,710 and 3,386. The number of mature individuals would be roughly double if applied to the upper bounds of the more recent estimates published in 2016.<br/><br/>There is virtually no substantiated documentation of population trends over appropriate time scales; Snow Leopard numbers are reportedly stable or modestly increasing in some areas, but are likely to be declining in others, including recent localized extinctions which may have occurred in some areas of the former Soviet Union. A decline of at least 10% over the next 3 generations (22.62 years) is estimated given the growing threat related to increasing livestock numbers in some countries or emerging threats like intensified road construction and mineral extraction. Although poaching appears to have declined since the late 1990s, Nowell <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> (2016) estimated that 221-450 Snow Leopards were poached annually since 2008 (based on extrapolation of cases known to over 40 surveyed experts); these were attributed to retaliation for actual or perceived livestock depredation, but this supposition is not substantiated by hard evidence. With the average rate of poaching detection estimated by experts at less than 38%, these numbers could be substantially higher. If these poaching estimates are anywhere near accurate, this suggests that roughly 2-10% of the population could be poached annually. While a direct relationship between offtake and a population decline is not clear, even at the magnitude reported by Nowell <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2016, it adds to the plausibility of a 10% decline over 3 generations (22.62 years).<br/><br/><strong>Approach to Uncertainty</strong><br/>The IUCN Red List Criteria are designed to incorporate the use of inference, suspicion and projection, to allow taxa to be assessed in the absence of detailed and complete data, which are rarely available across the entire range of a taxon; the absence of high-quality data should not deter attempts at applying the criteria (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2016). Throughout this assessment, we have attempted to show the degree to which we have dealt with uncertainty stemming from the paucity of data for this elusive and secretive species. To ensure this assessment is both “precautionary and credible,"" as specified by IUCN (2012), a range of values as well as best estimates were considered for the critical parameters, including those used in modelling the number of 'mature individuals' (MI) in the population. Specifically, the model dealt with uncertainty by including a variety of scenarios with cats maturing between 2 to 4 years of age, and then applied the resultant MI percent to the lowest published population estimate which, contrary to convention, included dependent yearlings (Appendix 2 in the Supporting Information). Here, even the very lowest bound of the estimated range of mature individuals did not fall within the threshold for the Endangered category.<br/><br/>It is acknowledged that precise and robust estimates of Snow Leopard density are difficult to obtain, are available for only a limited proportion of the global range, and represent small study sites selected for their suitability for the species. Because extrapolation to larger areas or even range-wide would be tenuous, we have avoided doing so in all cases. Estimates of Snow Leopard population size based on rigorous study design and survey methodology are sparse. The national population estimates cited here are considered to be the best available, following advice in the Red List Guidelines: “<strong>The plausible range may be established using.….. the opinion of a single expert, or the consensus view of a group of experts</strong>” (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2016).<br/><br/>There is also a lack of hard data on overall population trends, which hinders estimates of the magnitude of any decline which rely on fragmentary evidence and are therefore largely speculative. Nonetheless, the evidence considered does not suggest that the situation has deteriorated since 2008, which would be needed to justify an Endangered listing under criterion C1.<br/><br/><strong>Reasons for Change in IUCN Red List Status</strong><br/>The previous assessment in 2008 (Endangered C1) was based on &lt;2,500 mature  individuals and an estimated decline of 20% over 16  years (two generations). However, in that assessment, effective  population size  (Ne) was incorrectly used as a surrogate for ‘mature  individuals’ and  produces a lower figure (50% of the adult population of  4,080).  Therefore, the species should have been listed as Vulnerable in  2008.<br/><br/>Moreover, given the apparent limits to dispersal (Riordan <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em>   2015), it is questionable whether such a small number of individuals   capable of breeding (and therefore fewer actually breeding) is   demographically viable over such an extensive range. Recent survey   information indicates that Snow Leopard densities in several areas are   higher than previously believed, implying that the overall population   size is also likely to be larger than the minimum estimates (Jackson<em> et  al.</em>  2010, SLSS 2014, McCarthy and Mallon 2016). The revised estimate of   the number of mature individuals addressed the earlier mistake, in   combination with new information, and the change from EN to VU is therefore a non-genuine change.<br/><br/>The   estimated 20% decline over 16 years in 2008 included a documented   upsurge in poaching for skins and body parts in the countries of Central   Asia, following the break-up of the Soviet Union around 1991. While   this threat has since subsided, it is unlikely to have completely   disappeared. The other traditional threats still exist, alongside   emerging potential threats such as mining and other infrastructure   development (roads, railroads, hydro-dams, etc.), some of which will have   intensified in recent years (summaries in Snow Leopard Network 2014,   McCarthy and Mallon 2016).<br/><br/>There have also been very significant   investments in conservation measures to reduce threats or to mitigate   their effects. These include: establishment of new protected areas in   Snow Leopard range; more effective anti-poaching measures; training and   capacity-building of range country conservation professionals; a number   of independent initiatives to reduce conflict with herders (e.g.,   strengthening livestock corrals, vaccination, handicrafts and   alternative livelihoods, grazing set-asides); community engagement   programmes; the illegalization of guns in China since 1989; and   education programmes to raise awareness of the Snow Leopard and its   habitat (see the <em>Conservation Measures</em> section for more details and  examples). The Rangewide Priority Setting workshop in Beijing in 2008  (Sanderson <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em>  2016), the Global Snow Leopard and Ecosystem  Protection Program (Snow  Leopard Working Secretariat 2013) and the  revised version of the Snow  Leopard Survival Strategy (Snow Leopard  Network 2014) have all enhanced  the global strategic framework.<br/><br/>Although  the Snow Leopard undoubtedly is still threatened, the  measures listed  above are collectively considered to have contributed  to improving the  overall conservation situation for Snow Leopards since  2008. The  generation length of 8 years used in 2008 has been revised to 7.54 years  following Pacifici <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2013).  There is no current evidence to  support a decline of 20% over such a  short period of 15.08 years, as  needed to support a listing as  Endangered, and which would represent a  steeper decline and therefore a  deterioration in the situation since  2008. However, in view of the  existing and emerging threats, a decline  of 10% or more over 22.62  years (three generations) is considered plausible  (starting in 2014). This  change in the estimated rate of decline is the  result of conservation  actions taken, so potentially could qualify as genuine change and  on this basis IUCN's 5-year waiting period would apply, dated from the first  draft of this  assessment (June 2014).&#160;However, since the EN category in 2008  was incorrect, the species should have been listed as VU in 2008, the  change in category is therefore non-genuine.","Snow Leopards inhabit mountainous rangelands at elevations of 3,000 to over 5,000 m in the Himalaya and Tibetan Plateau, but can occur as low as 500 m in the Altai (Snow Leopard Network 2014). Wild caprids are the principal natural prey of Snow Leopards, especially Blue Sheep (<em>Pseudois nayaur</em>) and Siberian Ibex <em></em>(<em>Capra sibirica</em>), whose distribution coincides closely with Snow Leopard range. Argali (<em>Ovis ammon) </em>and Markhor (<em>Capra</em> <em>falconeri</em>) are also important prey in some areas. Primary productivity in Snow Leopard habitat is relatively low due to low temperatures and high aridity, consequently, the density of ungulate prey also tends to be relatively low, with reports ranging from 0.9 to 10.2 animals per km² (e.g., Suryawanshi <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Mallon <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016). Wild prey abundance is one of the main determinants of Snow Leopard abundance (Suryawanshi <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013).<br/><br/>Snow Leopard diet is dominated by wild caprids, reportedly contributing 45% to 98% of the diet, while livestock may contribute 40-70%, though generally more on the order of 15-30% (Schaller <em>et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em></em> 1987, Oli<em> et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em> </em>1994, Chundawat and Rawat 1994, Jackson 1996, Bagchi and Mishra 2006, Anwar <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2011, Shezad <em>et al<em>.</em></em> 2012, Jumabay-Uulu <em>et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em> </em>2014, Suryawanshi <em>et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Mallon<em> et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em></em> 2016). Smaller prey reported in Snow Leopard diet (approximately 12–25%) include marmots (<em>Marmota </em>spp.), pika (<em>Ochotona </em>spp.), hares (<em>Lepus </em>spp.), small rodents, and birds. It appears that the contribution of small sized prey in Snow Leopard diet may have been overestimated in earlier studies due to inadvertent inclusion of scats of other carnivores such as foxes (<em>Vulpes</em> spp.) in the analyses of Snow Leopard diet. Results of recent studies that have confirmed the identity of scats through faecal DNA (e.g., Anwar <em>et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em></em> 2011, Jumabay-Uulu <em>et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em> </em>2014, Suryawanshi<em> et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em> </em>2013) or examined prey DNA in scats (Shezad<em> et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em> </em>2012) report the contribution of small sized prey to be relatively low (2-8%).<br/><br/>Although Snow Leopards may occur in relatively flat or rolling areas such as in parts of Mongolia and the Tibetan Plateau (Schaller 1998, McCarthy 2000), within their habitat, they favour steep, rugged and broken terrain and rocky outcrops (Jackson<em> et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010). Mountain ridges, cliff edges, and well-defined drainage lines serve as common travel routes and sites for the deposition of signs, including scrapes, scats, and scent marks (Ahlborn and Jackson 1988).<br/><br/>There is substantial variation in the reported home range sizes of Snow Leopards. An earlier study in Nepal based on ground-based very high frequency (VHF) tracking reported home ranges of five individuals between 12 and 39 km², with substantial overlap between individuals and sexes (Jackson and Ahlborn 1989). However, the home range of a single Snow Leopard radio-collared in 2013 in Nepal using a satellite collar was estimated to be &gt; 400 km² (Rinjan Shreshtha, WWF, pers. comm). McCarthy <em>et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em> </em>(2005) reported home range size of four Snow Leopards based on VHF tracking in Mongolia to range between 13 and 141 km², while the satellite-monitored home range of one of these individuals in the same study was at least 15 times higher. In the most current and comprehensive study to have been undertaken, home ranges of 18 individuals monitored between 2008 and 2014 using Global Positioning System (GPS) Satellite telemetry in Mongolia ranged from approximately 100 to &gt;1,000 km² (SLT, Panthera and SLCF, unpubl. data).<br/><br/>A four-year camera trapping study in Mongolia reveals considerable underlying dynamics in an otherwise stable population of Snow Leopards, with the adult sex ratio apparently changing from being male-biased to female-biased during the study period (1.67 to 0.38 males per female, Sharma <em>et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014). This is the first study to estimate vital rates including probabilities of immigration and emigration. The adult survival probability for the study population was estimated at 0.83 (Sharma <em>et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014).","Appendix 2 of the Snow Leopard Survival Strategy (Snow Leopard Network 2014) provides a global and country-by-country threat assessment based on the GSLEP-supported exercise drawing loosely on the Threats Reduction Assessment (TRA) protocol of Salafsky and Margoluis (1999) and involving select experts from each range country. McCarthy and Mallon (2016) include several chapters exploring well-known and emerging threats including livestock depredation, prey declines, disease, illegal trade, climate change, and resource extraction. There is considerable variation in the type and extent of threat among countries, especially with respect to large countries such as China or Mongolia where suitable habitat is extensive and split across different administrative regions. The main ongoing threats fall into three broad areas: 1) competition with livestock, habitat degradation and declines in prey; 2) depredation by Snow Leopards on livestock and retaliatory killing; 3) illegal trade in furs, bones and other body parts. New threats have been identified since 2003, including climate change, mining, large scale infrastructure and barriers such as roads or fenced railway lines (Wingard <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014, Zahler 2016); however, the potential impact of these emerging threats on Snow Leopards or their habitat is as yet difficult to quantify. A further set of threats regarded as less severe at the range-wide level, or at least more localized, include the lack of awareness among local people and policymakers, insufficient institutional capacity and law enforcement, and limited transboundary collaboration.<br/><br/>Specific threats to particular populations are outlined below: <br/><br/>Recently Nowell <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> (2016) found that over 90% of annual Snow Leopard poaching is estimated to occur in five range countries: China (103-236 animals poached per year), Mongolia (34-53), Pakistan (23-53), India (21-45) and Tajikistan (20-25). While the highest levels of poaching and illegal trade are in China, which has the largest share of Snow Leopard range, countries with smaller shares of global range were flagged for having disproportionately high levels of estimated poaching (Nepal and Pakistan) and illegal Snow Leopard trade (Afghanistan and Russia). Afghanistan, Bhutan and Kazakhstan had markedly low levels of seizures compared to observations of poaching and illegal trade, suggesting the need for strengthened law enforcement in these countries (Nowell <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016).","There are no robust estimates of Snow Leopard global population size and the various figures available are best regarded as guesses: 4,080-6,500 (McCarthy and Chapron 2003); 4,500-7,500 (Jackson <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010), and 3,920-6,390 (Snow Leopard Working Secretariat 2013). There are several difficulties to overcome in making reliable estimates of Snow Leopard population size (Snow Leopard Network 2014), namely this species’ secretive nature, generally low density, sparse (or sporadic) distribution and remote terrain contributing to generally low detection rates and small sample sizes that in turn may make extrapolation problematic. Until recently, most studies were conducted over rather small areas, sometimes smaller than the home range of a single Snow Leopard, rendering the information inadequate to make population and density inferences over larger areas (Appendix 1 in Snow Leopard Network 2014). Furthermore, not all studies report the size of the surveyed area, thus precluding generation of density estimates. These limitations are starting to be addressed, for example through the adoption of more robust methods, such as spatially-explicit recapture models from camera data (e.g., Shrestha <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Thinley <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014, Alexander <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2015). Additionally, recently published information includes relatively rigorous surveys conducted over larger areas (see below).<br/><br/>Snow Leopards are known to breed at 2 or 3 years of age (Leif Blomqvist, International Snow Leopard Studbook Keeper, Helsinki Zoo, pers. comm., Jay Tetzloff, US Association of Zoos and Aquariums Snow Leopard Species Survival Plan Coordinator, pers. comm., McCarthy and Chapron 2003). Field observations are consistent with Snow Leopards breeding at 2 or 3 years of age. Of two known-age females in a long-term radio-telemetry study of Snow Leopards in Mongolia, one gave birth at the age of 3 years and the other at age 3 or 4 years (O. Johansson, pers. comm. and Panthera/Snow Leopard Trust unpublished data). Since breeding occurs in February/March and birth occurs in May/June, this means that one female definitely bred at age 2 years and the second bred when either 2 or 3 years old. Two other females of estimated age in the same study likely gave birth when 3-4 years old, again indicating successful breeding at 2-3 years old. Sexual maturity and breeding at 2-3 years old appears to be consistent across a range of large wild felids (Berry <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 1997, Hunter 1998, Kelly <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 1998, Balme <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012, Hunter <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Miller 2013, Miller and Funston 2014).<br/><br/>The IUCN Red List guidelines (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2016) define 'mature individuals' as individuals known, estimated or inferred to be capable of reproduction. The guidelines also state that age of first reproduction in the wild may be later than the age at which an individual is biologically capable of breeding. Hence, mature individuals in the Red List context are those capable of breeding, not just those actually breeding in any given year. Snow Leopards are capable of breeding beginning at 2 years of age and thus meet the IUCN definition of mature individuals, even if they do not actually start to breed this young.<br/><br/>Estimating the percent of mature individuals (≥  2 years of age) in the wild Snow Leopard population has been historically difficult, but with the extensive application of camera trapping new information is available. In 21 camera trapping studies conducted in 6 countries between 2003 and 2014 and comprising more than 29,165 trap-nights, a mean of 82.3% of Snow Leopards captured in photos were independent animals (Appendix 1 in the Supporting Information). Snow Leopards become independent at between 18 and 26 months old, hence, a small percent of independent cats in camera trap photos may not yet have reached the mature age class (2-year olds).<br/><br/>With few exceptions, published felid population estimates do not include dependent cubs. Camera-trapping derived density estimates are an example where exclusion of cubs applies. The global population estimate of 4,080-6,590 Snow Leopards (McCarthy and Chapron 2003) only includes mature individuals. Similarly, the 2008 Red List assessment (Jackson <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008) for Snow Leopard states that the population estimate is for adults only and the authors calculate effective population size (2,040) as 50% of the estimated total number of adults (4,080), citing Nowell <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> (2007). Hence, for the purposes of estimating the percent of mature individuals, published Snow Leopard population estimates should be considered to be comprised of adults only.<br/><br/>Population modelling can be used to estimate the percent of individuals in each age class. McCarthy <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2015 (Appendix 2 in supplementary material) employed a stochastic age-structured population model to produce a suite of stable stage population matrices. Vital rate input variables included the age at which Snow Leopards become capable of reproduction (mature), and the percentage of each age class that actually bred. The proportion of yearlings in the population estimate varied in the model from 0% to 50%. The model was run using nine scenarios of various combinations of vital rates and percentages of yearlings in the population. The lowest percentage of mature individuals (MI) was obtained when 2-year old maturity rates were lowest (25%), actual breeding did not begin until age 3, and the proportion of cubs in the population estimate was highest (50%). Yet even in that most precautionary scenario a mean MI of 67.7% (s.d. = 2.07) was obtained. Applying that MI percent to the most conservative global population estimate of 4,000 individuals, yields 2,710 (s.d. = 83) mature individuals. Model outputs for all nine scenarios when applied to this minimum population of 4,000 ranged from 2,710 to 3,386 MI. In no case did MI fall below the threshold required for an Endangered designation for the species.<br/><br/>A population of &lt; 2,500 mature individuals distributed across 1,776,000 km² (taking a relatively conservative estimate of global range size from Snow Leopard Working Secretariat 2013) or a maximum of 3,300,000 km² (Snow Leopard Network 2014) equates to a density of one Snow Leopard capable of reproduction per 710 km² or 1,320 km² respectively. We question how such a scenario would be demographically viable; and in fact, recent best-practice density estimates largely range from 1 to over 3 per 100 km² for areas surveyed to date (see below).<br/><br/>Doubt is also being cast on the lower estimates of the global Snow Leopard population size through the expansion of field surveys in recent years and the application of more sophisticated and reliable survey techniques (such as systematic camera trapping, faecal genotyping and satellite collaring). Recent studies have confirmed the presence of Snow Leopards in new areas or their reappearance in former areas. Snow Leopards returned to the Sagarmatha area, Nepal, in 2002-2003 after an absence of <em>ca</em> 25 years (Lovari <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2009, Ferretti <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014). Snow Leopard presence in the Vakhan Range of Tajikistan was confirmed by camera-trapping for the first time in 2011 (Diment <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012) and in the Kizilsu area of the Gissar Nature Reserve in Uzbekistan in 2013 (Panthera, unpublished data). In other areas, studies have indicated stable or even circumstantial evidence of increasing populations. In Wakhan District (10,000 km²) in Afghanistan, the National Environmental Protection Agency reports that numbers of Snow Leopards and one of their main prey, argali <em>Ovis ammon</em>, have increased in recent years (www.khaama.org 06 August 2015). The Snow Leopard population in Tost Uul, South Gobi, Mongolia, has been the object of the most intensive (and reliable) research to date using satellite collaring and camera trapping and was reported to be stable during the course of four years of study (Sharma <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014). This site was completely unprotected until recently.<br/><br/>A review of the majority of camera trap and genetic surveys to date indicate densities in excess of 1.5 adults per 100 km². Densities of 0.87-2.85 and 0.32-1.62 per 100 km² were reported at two sites in the Eastern Pamirs (Kachel 2014). In Bhutan, there is a “bright future for Snow Leopards” (Wangchuk and Tharchen 2016) and density in Wangchuk Centennial Park, Bhutan was estimated at 2.39/100 km² by Shrestha <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> (2013). Thinley <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> (2014) found even higher densities in Bhutan’s Jigme Dorji National Park (6.2/100 km²) and estimated that the protected area could harbour as many as 192 Snow Leopards, which is nearly equal to the high end of the estimate for the entire country (200). At six sites in Ladakh-Spiti, India, densities were 0.45, 0.74, 1.17, 1.66, 1.94, and 3.3 per 100 km² (Suryawanshi <em>et al</em>. 2013). Density in Sarychat-Ertash State Reserve, Kyrgyzstan, was 1.38 per 100 km² (Jumabay-uulu <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014), which is a reserve that Koshkarev and Vyrypaev (2000) pointed to as having been ‘absolutely trapped out’, with surveys in 1999 finding no sign of Snow Leopards after the post-Soviet declines earlier that decade.<br/><br/>In China, Snow Leopard presence has been confirmed at numerous locations across all parts of the range, including areas where the species was thought to have disappeared such as Inner Mongolia (Riordan and Shi 2016). The Second National Biodiversity Survey of China being undertaken by the State Forestry Administration suggests that there have been improvements for Snow Leopard and their ecosystems across the country since the first assessment reported in 1995. Snow Leopard populations in the Sanjiangyuan region are believed to have increased in the last 20 years along with those of a major prey species, Blue Sheep (<em>Pseudois nayaur</em>) (Liu <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016). Camera-trap surveys in Suojia (also in Sanjiangyuan) indicated densities of 3.1/100 km² (Li 2012). Alexander <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> (2015), using spatially-explicit recapture models, reported 3.31 Snow Leopards/100 km² in the Qilian Shan range, where surveys in the 1980s suggested densities &lt; 1/100 km². Schaller (2014) resurveyed portions of the Qilian Shan range in Qinghai 29 years after he first surveyed the area and although direct comparisons were not made they saw more Snow Leopard sign and more Blue Sheep in their recent surveys. Qinghai Forestry Department recently increased their estimate for the province to at least 1,000 individuals based on camera trapping surveys (Liu <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016). Riordan and Shi (2016) estimate Snow Leopard populations for each province in China, totalling at least 4,500 for the whole country. Since China contains c. 60% of the overall range this figure implies that the global population may possibly reach 7,500, broadly in line with the upper estimates described above. The current situation for Snow Leopard in China is a result of new information emerging as survey effort improves, as well as positive effects of the illegalization of firearms in China in 1989, along with hunting bans in key provinces, and greater awareness of the national importance of Snow Leopards.<br/><br/>Some, but not all, of the recent studies have been in protected areas or locations thought to have good populations of Snow Leopards, so densities might be higher there than elsewhere, and thus these figures are not easily extrapolated to the entire range. However, taken together, and considering the widely spread localities within the overall distribution of Snow Leopards, these figures do seem to suggest that the global population size is closer to the upper end of the estimates cited above, rather than the lower end.<br/><br/>Two sets of global population estimates published in 2015, after the modelling exercise in Appendix 2 (in the Supporting Information) was carried out, also suggest that Snow Leopard numbers are higher than previously estimated in 2003. In 2008, an expert knowledge process was used to map current Snow Leopard range and identify important Snow Leopard Conservation Units (SLCUs) within that range (McCarthy <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016). Experts from all range states and global experts participated and identified 69 SLCUs. Adequate information was available to estimate Snow Leopard population size in 56 SLCUs, placing it at 4,678 to 8,745 adults and large sub-adults within an area of 875,818 km², or about 31.5% of currently occupied range. The population trend was considered to be stable or increasing in 33 (48%) of SLCUs and decreasing in only 15 (22%), while no information on trend was reported by experts in 11 (30%) of the units. Notably, experts indicated that most population and trend estimates they provided came from recent research as opposed to previous ‘guesstimates’ lacking field-based evidence.<br/><br/>With the recent publication of the first ever comprehensive book on the species (McCarthy and Mallon 2016), additional light has been shed on current Snow Leopard population estimates in most of the 12 range countries. National experts authored individual chapters providing updates on the status of the species in their home countries. With the exception of Bhutan those chapters included current population estimates; taking the high and low values of the population ranges provided (Table 1 in the Supporting Information) a range-wide population of 7,367-7,884 is indicated. If the results of the 2014-2016 Bhutan Snow Leopard census are added in (79-112: Thinley <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016), the global population would then be estimated at 7,446 to 7,996. This indicates that Snow Leopards are likely more numerous than historic estimates suggest, perhaps substantially so. It should be noted that this represents better knowledge and not necessarily a population increase.<br/><br/>There is little evidence to indicate that small-scale fragmentation and lack of connectivity are significant issues, despite the typically insular nature of mountain habitat and the species’ preference for steep or broken terrain. Most of Snow Leopard range is more or less contiguous and it is difficult to delimit separate subpopulations (Jackson, unpub. data; Janecka, unpub. data); furthermore, other than major rivers along the periphery of Snow Leopard range, some border fences, and short sections of railroads or major highways, there currently appear to be few major barriers to restrict movement. The Mongolia telemetry study has confirmed that Snow Leopards are capable of crossing open habitat (desert plains) in excess of 100 km (Panthera/SLT unpublished data) and Snow Leopards have been encountered attempting to cross the Chinese Gobi Desert in Inner Mongolia on at least three occasions (Riordan <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2015, Nei Mongol Wildlife Division, pers. comm). Riordan <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> (2015) used resistant kernel modelling to assess connectivity and predicted two regional populations, in the north and south of the species range, and identified several potentially important connecting areas. Snow Leopard range in Nepal lies in five “relatively contiguous habitat blocks” (Ale <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016); in Pakistan, there is “confirmed presence over large landscapes” (Ud-Din and Nawaz<em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016); the range in Bhutan is virtually contiguous across the whole of the north of the country (Wangchuk and Tharchen 2016); in Sanjiangyuan region, a key Snow Leopard habitat in China, “there are abundant connections between important habitats” (Li 2012, Liu <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016).<br/><br/><strong>Current Population Trend</strong>:<br/>Snow Leopard numbers are reportedly stable or modestly increasing in some areas, but are likely to be declining in others. Recent localized extinctions may have occurred in some areas of the former Soviet Union (Taubmann <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016). Evidence of increased or re-established populations described above may in some cases be a consequence of enhanced survey effort in previously unsurveyed areas, although conservation actions and policies will have no doubt helped. However, there remains a lack of sufficiently longitudinal surveys, except in very few sites, and thus we have virtually no substantiated documentation of population trends over appropriate time scales. This is an information gap that urgently needs to be filled in order to validate this and all future Red List assessments and provide a reliable basis from which to evaluate conservation actions and measure their impact.<br/><br/><strong>Population Reduction - Past </strong><br/>Population reductions in the Central Asian republics—which represent only 7% of the global occupied range (McCarthy <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016)—following the collapse of the Soviet Union are thought to have been as high as 40-75% during the 1990s. There is no evidence to indicate such high rates of decline continued beyond the late 1990s.<br/><br/><strong>Population Reduction - Future</strong> <br/>Recent surveys in Pakistan suggest that Snow Leopard numbers in parts of the country may be lower than previously thought (Snow Leopard Foundation, unpublished reports, Nawaz and Hameed 2015) and may experience further decline in the future. Localized extinctions, such as those documented by Taubmann <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> (2016) in parts of the Alay region of Kyrgyzstan, may be expected in other isolated sites in Central Asia. There are also growing threats from extractive industries across the species’ range and potential impacts from climate change which may influence population trends. Despite positive conditions described previously, a decline of 10% over the next 3 generations (22.62 years) is estimated in light of localized declines given the growing threat related to increasing livestock numbers in some countries or emerging threats like intensified road construction and mineral extraction (see below). However, projecting rural development more than 3-5 years into the future is difficult, even in countries with well-articulated 5-10 year Development Plans, environmental impact laws or robust protocols for forecasting economic growth.<br/>&#160;<br/><strong>Population Reduction - Ongoing</strong> <br/>Current reductions appear to be modest and local, likely driven by a declining natural prey base, localized poaching for skins, and sporadic but apparently increasing human-wildlife conflict resulting from depredation of livestock. Growing flocks of sheep and goats and a thriving meat (e.g., Nepal and Pakistan) and cashmere trade (China and Mongolia) appear to lie at the root of these inter-connected threats (Berger <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013). However, where not mitigated, the mix of livestock-wild ungulate competition, associated rangeland degradation, declining natural prey numbers and Snow Leopard predation of livestock would likely accelerate retributive killing by herders, who could also be expected to offset their economic losses by funnelling Snow Leopard body parts into the illegal trade network.",Decreasing,"The range of the Snow Leopard extends from the Himalaya in the south, across the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and the mountains of Central Asia to the mountains of southern Siberia in the north. It occurs in the Altai, Sayan, Tien Shan, Kunlun, Pamir, Hindu Kush, Karakoram, and outer Himalayan ranges and in smaller isolated mountains in the Gobi region. It occurs in 12 countries: Afghanistan, Bhutan, China, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. A small area of potential range occurs in northern Myanmar but recent Snow Leopard presence has not been confirmed. The area of occupied range was recently estimated to be about 2.8 million km² (McCarthy <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016).","Poaching and illegal trade has been a traditional threat and continues in many parts of the range. Currently, the demand for rugs, luxury décor, and taxidermy, especially from China and Eastern Europe appears on the increase (EIA 2012). In China, that holds the largest Snow Leopard population, trade in Snow Leopard pelt and bones, which was earlier restricted to Snow Leopard range provinces, is reported to also be emerging in the wealthier coastal cities since 2010 (Li and Lu 2014). The extent of illegal trade was reviewed by Maheshwari and Von Meibom (2016).",Terrestrial,"Very significant investments in conservation have been made. These include: establishment of new protected areas within the Snow Leopard range; anti-poaching measures; training and capacity-building; initiatives to reduce conflict with herders (e.g. strengthening livestock corrals, vaccination, handicrafts and alternative livelihoods, grazing set-asides), community engagement programmes; illegalization and confiscation of firearms across China, and education programmes to raise awareness of the Snow Leopard and its habitat (see Conservation Measures section for more details and examples). The Rangewide Priority Setting workshop in Beijing in 2008 (Sanderson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016), the Global Snow Leopard and Ecosystem Protection Program (Snow Leopard Working Secretariat 2013) and the revised version of the Snow Leopard Survival Strategy (Snow Leopard Network 2014) have all enhanced the global strategic framework for conservation of the species.<br/><br/>Illegal poaching, the main threat to Russia's Snow Leopard population, was recently alleviated, at least in several important areas, by concerted removal of wire-snares and the recruitment of former poachers as protected area rangers (Paltsyn <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016). Anti-poaching efforts in Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan have also been strengthened, thus addressing the main underlying threat that led to the drastic decline in numbers in several Central Asia states following the break-up of the Soviet Union 25 years ago.<br/><br/>In terms of protected area establishment and enhancement, the whole of Wakhan District Afghanistan (&gt;10,000 km²) has been declared the country’s second national park (Moheb and Paley 2016). Sarychat Ertash State Reserve, a key site in Kyrgyzstan, has recently been enlarged by 150 km² and mining concessions withdrawn (<a href=""www.snowleopard.org"">www.snowleopard.org</a> 3 June 2015), and several projects have worked on management planning, training and monitoring and/ or provided substantial amounts of equipment (Hotham <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016). Tost Uul, a key site in Mongolia’s South Gobi, was declared a local nature reserve in 2010 (<a href=""www.snowleopard.org"">www.snowleopard.org</a>, 4 October 2015). Capacity building in Zorkul State Reserve in the Eastern Pamir of Tajikistan includes development of a new management plan, training programmes, and substantial donations of equipment (Mallon and Diment 2013). The role of Buddhist monasteries in providing effective protection around monasteries was highlighted by Li <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2014). The GSLEP initiative, along with conservation practitioners have been highlighting customary beliefs of Snow Leopards as important totem animals for select traditional communities across this species' range.<br/><br/>A number of transboundary projects provide important conservation benefits to Snow Leopards across their range (Rosen and Zahler 2016). Two transboundary or landscape-level projects are currently operating in Central Asia (Mallon and Kulikov 2015): The Khan Tengri nature conservation park (3,257 km²) has been designated in eastern Kyrgyzstan that will link Naryn Reserve, Sarychat Ertash Reserve, and two others in Kyrgyzstan with Tomur Nature Reserve in China; a transboundary project is currently operating in the northern Tien Shan (Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan) with Snow Leopard as a focal species and with the aim of developing cooperation and enhancing protected areas. The UNDP/GEF Altai-Sayan Project (2007-2012) also identified the Snow Leopard as one of its focal species and carried out a series of transboundary projects including camera trapping, and training (WWF 2012).<br/><br/>Many incentive programs have been initiated (reviewed in Mishra <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003 and see chapters in McCarthy and Mallon 2016). One oft-cited threat is the killing of Snow Leopards by herders in retaliation for predation on livestock, exacerbated by occasions when many sheep or goats are killed in a single attack by a Snow Leopard gaining entry to poorly constructed or maintained night-time corrals. Remedial measures have involved strengthening corrals to make them predator-proof. To date, over 260 corrals have been strengthened in Afghanistan, India, Pakistan and Tajikistan with the result that no subsequent livestock predation occurred (Mohammad <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Moheb and Paley 2016). A similar programme in Western Tyva, Russia protected corrals in 46 herder camps, and since 2008 no predation occurred in any of them and annual losses of livestock fell by 50-60% (Paltsyn <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016).<br/><br/>Innovative community programmes have been established in Afghanistan and Pakistan, with new governance structures created (over 65 in Pakistan) aimed at local natural resource management, and with over 50 rangers in the Afghan Wakhan and over 100 rangers in Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan monitoring wildlife and enforcing local and national regulations against poaching and other resource extraction activities (Zahler and Paley 2016). A programme has been pioneered by the Snow Leopard Trust in Mongolia and Kyrgyzstan to increase local incomes by providing training in the manufacture of handicrafts and access for the finished products to international markets in return for a commitment to prevent poaching of Snow Leopards and their prey and to engage in environmental education and other activities. These programmes have proved successful and have had additional benefits (Bayarjargal <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016). In Kyrgyzstan, no Snow Leopards or prey were poached during 2014 in any of the partner communities (<a href=""www.snowleopard.org"">www.snowleopard.org</a> 3 June 2015). Incentives related to ecotourism have led to a surge in Snow Leopard sightings in Hemis National Park, Ladakh (India), attributed to a combination of corral predator-proofing and meaningful income generation associated with community-managed homestays first initiated in 2007 (Jackson and Wangchuk 2004, Wangchuk <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010, Jackson 2015, Namgail and Dadul 2016). With these local communities now perceiving Snow Leopards positively instead of pests to be killed or chased away, this notoriously elusive big cat is now being regularly observed from distances as close as 50-200 meters, especially during its mating season in winter.<br/><br/>In addition to these programmes, other conservation initiatives include grazing set-asides (village reserves; Mishra <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016), livestock vaccination (Nawaz <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016), livestock insurance (Kunkel <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016) and a range of education and awareness projects (Hillard <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016). Conservation initiatives that blend conservation science with traditional knowledge, and which mitigate Snow Leopard-related human-wildlife conflict, improve household incomes for households dependent upon livestock, and that highlight the cultural and ecological importance of Snow Leopards are also most likely to be embraced by local people who likely represent the effective and cost-efficient stewards for this felid's remote mountain landscapes (Jackson and Brewer-Lama 2016).",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
56005589,42190,Muntiacus muntjak,Least Concern,,2016,2015-11-18 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Southern Red Muntjac is listed as Least Concern because it remains common throughout most of its range, is resilient to hunting and increases in numbers with logging and presumably other forms of forest disruption, and survives even almost complete conversion of forest to at least some crop plantations. Densities are probably widely below carrying capacity, particularly where habitat is highly fragmented. Its use of the hills means that most of the population is outside the very high forest conversion rates recently occurring in the Sundaic level lowlands, and gives it a healthier conservation outlook than that for <em>M. atherodes</em> with which it is sympatric on Borneo. The coming years will see further fragmentation and if hunting continues at current high levels, wider declines and a higher frequency of local extinction than has so far occurred. Nonetheless, future declines are unlikely to be fast enough to warrant listing the species even as Near Threatened. No substantive new information was received since 2008 to suggest a change in status is required in 2016.","Southern Red Muntjac is associated with forest, but occurs widely even in heavily degraded forest and, in areas adjacent to forest, in plantations of coffee, rubber, sugarcane, cassava, coconut, and teak (Oka 1998, Laidlaw 2000, Azlan 2006, G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2008). However, its ability to survive in landscape-level stands of teak is probably dependent upon the retention of fringes of secondary growth along streams, gullies and other such features (M. Tyson pers. comm. 2008) and this may be so for the other plantation species, too. Peak densities are probably not in pristine forest: in east Java, secondary forest with gallery forest mosaic seems to hold higher densities, and this muntjac may also benefit even from agricultural conversion at forest edges (M. Tyson pers. comm. 2008). Muntjac (presumed to be largely or entirely <em>M. muntjak</em>) abundance was higher in areas within 1 km of the protected area boundary than in the interior of Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park, Sumatra (although this pattern was only weakly statistically significant), suggesting an association with edge, broken and secondary habitats (O’Brien <em>et al</em>. 2003). In contrast, an avoidance of the edge of the Taman Negara protected area in Malaysia was suspected by Kawanishi and Sunquist (2004). In Danum Valley (Sabah, Borneo), an area with negligible hunting, <em>M. muntjak</em> strongly increased in densities after logging (Heydon 1994, Davies <em>et al</em>. 2001), a weaker increase was found by Duff <em>et al</em>. (1984). In the Sarawak Planted Forests, Bintulu Division, Sarawak, muntjacs (partly this species) are among the commonest species camera-trapped in young acacia plantations (under four years old) and have been seen browsing on young acacia shoots. Footprints are common in the adjacent newly planted areas and forest fragments (Belden Giman pers. comm. 2008). However, this area contains a substantial proportion of natural, if somewhat degraded, forest, which in theory might be found to be necessary for populations in the highly altered habitats. Information on the species in landscape-scale plantations, remote from even secondary forest, has not been traced. Most of its range is dominated by evergreen vegetation, but it readily uses deciduous forests and mosaics of grassland, scrub, and forest (e.g. on Java, Tyson 2007), on Bali and Java, <em>M. muntjak</em> routinely uses woodland savanna as a feeding ground (Oka 1998, S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008). <br/><br/>This muntjac has a wide altitudinal range. In Java, S. Hedges (pers. comm. 2008) has seen them over 0–800 m. In Sumatra, it occurs widely in the lowlands and the second species there, <em>M. montanus</em>, seems to be montane, whether <em>M. muntjak</em> ascends to the highest forests is yet unclear (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, based on examination of specimens). On Borneo, Red Muntjac lives up to at least 1,000 m asl on the Usun Apau plateau (Payne <em>et al</em>. 1985), who stated that “available data suggests that [<em>M. atherodes</em>] predominates over the Red Muntjac in low hill ranges and coastal regions”, but Meijaard and Sheil (2008) pointed out that still “no robust quantitative data exist to support this [pattern]”. Red Muntjac is scarcer than <em>M. atherodes</em> in Sungai Wain forest, Kalimantan, which spans 30–150 m asl (G.M. Fredriksson pers. comm. 2008), in the Sarawak Planted Forests, Bintulu Division, a mix of acacia plantation and natural forest (Belden <em>et al</em>. 2007, Belden Giman pers. comm. 2008), and (slightly so) in the Ulu Segama area of Danum Valley Conservation Area, Sabah, which lies mostly at about 300 m asl (Siew Te Wong pers. comm. 2008). In Borneo, muntjacs were frequently seen, suspected to comprise roughly equal numbers of Red and Yellow, in the Batang Ai National Park, Sarawak, which lies mostly at 100–760 m asl (Meredith 1995).<br/><br/>The diet is mostly fruits, buds, tender leaves, flowers, herbs and young grass (Kitchener <em>et al</em>. 1990, Oka 1998). In Taman Negara, Malaysia, camera-trapping showed Red Muntjac to be mostly diurnal (Kawanishi and Sunquist 2004) whereas in Gunung Leuser, Sumatra, it was classed as cathemeral (i.e., sporadic and random intervals of activity during the day or night) (van Schaik and Griffiths 1996) and this is true for East Java (S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008), there may be some variation between localities in balance of day and night activity. It is a mostly solitary species that is capable of breeding through the year, and has been stated to be territorial (Kitchener <em>et al</em>. 1990, Oka 1998). However, Tyson (2007) found no evidence of territoriality in radio-collared female muntjacs of Baluran National Park, Java, although range overlap declined in the rainy season compared with the dry season. Nor was there evidence of males using exclusive ranges in any season, or any clear evidence of territorial defence. As in the case of <em>M. vaginalis</em>, occasional sightings of small groups probably refer to mating pairs, or to females with offspring (Oka 1998), or to loose aggregations at abundant food resources (M. Tyson pers. comm. 2008).","Habitat encroachment and hunting are both widespread in the Sundaic region. Indeed, they are often associated and all Borneo’s ungulates suffer from the increased hunting that often accompanies logging (Bennett and Dahaban 1995, Bennett and Gumal 2001), such that hunting to local extinction is the chief detrimental effect of logging on ungulates in Sarawak (Bennett and Gumal 2001). This conclusion probably is applicable across the Sundaic region. Southern Red Muntjac is widely hunted across its range (e.g. Bennett <em>et al</em>. 2000, Linkie <em>et al</em>. 2003, S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008, based on unpubl. data, East Java, 1991–2002), it is the most sought-after wild meat in Peninsular Malaysia (Kawanishi and Sunquist 2004) and is among the most preferred in Indonesia, although Sambar is the preferred species at least in East Kalimantan (Semiadi <em>et al</em>. 2004, Semiadi 2005).<br/><br/>However, there is no strong evidence that either hunting or habitat disruption are actually threats to the survival of populations except in the case of islands such as Singapore, where it is now extinct (Baker and Lim 2008). Peak densities are not in pristine forest (see Habitat and Ecology), and in Danum Valley (Sabah, Borneo), an area with negligible hunting, <em>M. muntjak</em> strongly increased in densities after logging (Heydon 1994, Davies <em>et al</em>. 2001), a weaker increase was found by Duff <em>et al</em>. (1984). Hence, even quite severe habitat disruption can increase ecological carrying capacity for this muntjac, at least temporarily.<br/><br/>In an area with heavy hunting, recorded densities of muntjacs (presumed <em>M. muntjak</em>) were twice as high in areas with low than with high human population density within 10 km of the Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park, Sumatra, but this difference was not statistically significant (O'Brien <em>et al</em>. 2003). Poaching pressure in Kerinci-Seblat National Park, Sumatra, among snared ungulates was greatest for muntjac as assessed by the diameter of the cable. Snaring is locally very high in the protected area, e.g. 51 snares (mostly of size suitable for muntjac) were found in 1 km² (Linkie <em>et al</em>. 2003), although it is much less intense than in areas of Indochina supporting the related <em>M. vaginalis</em> (J. Holden pers. comm. 2008). Data are too sparse to determine whether this hunting is driving declines. Habitat loss is also severe including within parts of the park (Linkie <em>et al</em>. 2003), and is an increasing phenomenon in Java (S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>Muntjacs are widely and heavily hunted on Borneo for meat, skins, and as a source of traditional remedies (Bennett <em>et al</em>. 2000, Mohd Azlan J. pers. comm. 2008, Belden Giman pers. comm. 2008, G.M. Fredriksson pers. comm. 2008, A.C. Sebastian pers. comm. 2008, Siew Te Wong pers. comm. 2008). Traditionally, hunting used traps, dogs and spears, and blowpipes. Hunters in remote parts of the interior still use these methods, but most animals now die by gunfire. Sarawak held 60,000 legally registered shotguns while Sabah held almost 13,000 in the mid 1990s (Bennett <em>et al</em>. 2000). Methods used in Indonesia include guns and spotlights along logging roads, snaring, and dogs (G.M. Fredriksson pers. comm. 2008, S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008). The combination of dogs and guns may be particularly efficient (Belden Giman pers. comm. 2008). Snaring is still very heavy outside well-secured areas, but shotguns remain an even bigger problem (Bennett <em>et al</em>. 2000, J. Mohd Azlan pers. comm. 2008, Siew Te Wong pers. comm. 2008). Unaccompanied packs of stray or even perhaps feral dogs are also likely to be a threat, particularly in forest isolates close to urban areas (e.g. Similajau National Park, J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). It is unlikely that hunters make any distinction between the two Bornean muntjac species directly, although it is plausible that <em>M. muntjak</em> is under lower hunting pressure than is <em>M. atherodes</em> reflecting its purported predominance in the hills and mountains (although there is little empirical evidence to support this), whereas most of the logging concessions currently lie in the lowlands. Some ethnic groups, at least the Punan, have traditional beliefs against eating muntjac meat (Belden Giman pers. comm. 2008), but over most of (at least) Malaysian Borneo, “in general, everyone will hunt and eat anything” (Bennett <em>et al</em>. 2000). Much hunting is for the market rather than local use, so there is a limitless demand. Bennett and Gumal (2001) profiled the hunting of ungulates in Sarawak in the mid 1990s thus: muntjacs (along with Bearded Hog <em>Sus barbatus</em> and Sambar <em>Rusa unicolor</em>) are heavily shot for wild meat trade across Sarawak, and these ungulates are the species most sought by the restaurants. Wild meat is widely sold in towns, villages, restaurants and logging camps throughout Sarawak, 250 sales outlets were estimated across the state in 1996, with an annual trade worth 3.75 million USD. Along the Rejang river alone, in the mid 1980s, 250 muntjacs were sold per year (Caldecott 1988). The market for meat is great and probably expanding. There were, then, no controls on commercial hunting of non-protected species (including muntjacs). The Master Plan for Wildlife in Sarawak (Wildlife Conservation Society and Sarawak Forest Department 1996) introduced a strict ban on all wildlife trade, shotgun ownership and cartridge sales in the late 1990s (Bennett and Gumal 2001). Substantial numbers of muntjacs are, nevertheless, still killed in the state, as they are elsewhere in Borneo.<br/><br/>Bennett <em>et al</em>. (2000) considered the effects of this onslaught upon muntjacs (not distinguished to species) through a lengthy hunting study in February 1993 to June 1995, in both Bornean states of Malaysia (Sarawak and Sabah), each with eight study areas. Muntjacs constituted only 3–10% of animals killed, but index counts of signs show an inverse relationship between sign index and hunting pressure so strong that the latter over-rode the effects of habitat variables in determining their densities. Hunting was so ubiquitous, even in protected areas, that in the two states, only one site (part of Danum Valley, Sabah) could be found as a control, where there was primary forest but negligible hunting levels. They concluded that “the only single factor offering any effective protection for [quarry species of] wildlife is difficulty of access”, whether animals are protected or non-protected species, inside or outside protected areas, had no significant restraint on hunting levels. In the interim, much forest has been lost and muntjac populations in the smaller and more isolated areas that remain must now be more vulnerable to local extinctions.","Recent camera-trap studies on all main occupied landmasses show this to be a common species. The following is only a part collation of existing studies. In Sumatra, muntjacs (not identified to species but presumed, given the habitats and altitudes, to be largely or entirely <em>M. muntjak</em>) were camera-trapped very commonly in Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park and around Gunung Leuser (van Schaik and Griffiths 1996, O’Brien <em>et al</em>. 2003). In Thailand, Red Muntjacs were recorded at over 40% of camera-trap locations in Kaeng Krachan National Park, a site that may contain either <em>M. vaginalis</em> or <em>M. muntjak</em> or both. Abundance did not vary with proximity to villages, even though a variety of hunting methods occurs on site (Ngoprasert <em>et al</em>. 2007). In West Malaysia, Red Muntjacs were commonly camera-trapped, at a high proportion of camera-sites, in Taman Negara, where densities were estimated at 3.2–4.05 per km² (Kawanishi and Sunquist 2004), were found to be ubiquitous and common at all nine potential Tiger <em>Panthera tigris</em> areas surveyed by Lynam <em>et al</em>. (2007), and were common in the Jerangau Forest Reserve, an area of secondary forest some of which was being logged at the time of study and where hunting was heavy enough to have eradicated (or reduced to very low densities) species such as Sambar <em>Cervus unicolor</em> (Azlan 2006). During a study of the mammals of West Malaysia’s virgin jungle reserves, they were found in 13 of 14 sites (seven virgin jungle reserves and seven adjacent logged areas), a much greater spread of occurrence than for most other mammals (Laidlaw 2000). In Java muntjacs have “persisted in many areas where there is some forest cover” (Whitten <em>et al</em>. 1996), were camera-trapped commonly in Ujung Kulon National Park (van Schaik and Griffiths 1996) and Gunung Halimun National Park (Suyanto 2003), and were studied in Baluran National Park (East Java) in the 1990s by Tyson (2007), the latter study found densities of 23–25 animals per km² in the park’s mosaic of open woodland, grassland, scrub at under 300 m asl during the dry season. These densities (considerably above those from Taman Negara) may be inflated by daily or seasonal movements of animals coming down to the coastal waterholes. The Baluran population may have benefited from a particular combination of seral processes including the growth of the exotic <em>Acacia nilotica</em>. Muntjacs remain locally very common on Bali (Oka 1998). Determining population status in Borneo is more difficult because of the difficulties of separation from <em>M. atherodes</em>, but it is clearly at least fairly common (Heydon 1994, for further discussion see Habitat and Ecology).",Decreasing,"Southern Red Muntjac, as defined here, occupies part of the Thai–Malay peninsula and occurs on the main islands of the Greater Sundas (Borneo, Java, Bali and Sumatra) and on various small islands (Chasen 1940, Groves 2003, Meijaard 2003). On Sumatra, it is not geographically limited to southern and eastern parts of the island despite various statements that it is (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Taking the northern limit on the peninsula as the Isthmus of Kra (see Taxonomy), <em>M. muntjak</em> (as here defined) is assumed to inhabit southern Thailand and might be found to occur in southernmost Myanmar. It is now extinct in Singapore (Baker and Lim 2008).","The Southern Red Muntjac is an important source of bushmeat. Selected body parts and the foetus are also used in traditional medicine (see references in the General Information section).<br/>Individuals are usually killed during, or shortly after, their capture. Foothold snares are commonly used as well as spears and firearms. Dogs are often employed as an auxiliary force on this type of game. (See references in the General Information section).",Terrestrial,"Southern Red Muntjac is found in many protected areas throughout its range (GMA Indonesia Workshop). It is a protected game species in West Malaysia under the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972, meaning that it can be hunted only with a license and only outside protected areas (Kawanishi and Sunquist 2004). Indonesian forestry law protects all species of muntjac. Species protection laws relating to ungulates in many areas of Sumatra have not been widely publicized. A significant percentage of Sumatra’s forests are protected, but protected areas and the authorities responsible for conservation of catchment forests are often under-funded and almost all are grossly understaffed so that there is little ranger presence in the field. Where there are field ranger teams, these focus generally on flagship species such as Asian Elephant <em>Elephas maximus</em>, Sumatran Rhinoceros <em>Dicerorhinus sumatrensis</em> or Tiger <em>Panthera tigris</em>, although Tiger protection rangers do also conduct ungulate protection activities and in 2007 three hunters arrested in the national park with two muntjacs carcasses received custodial sentences at Kerinci district court (D.

Schwede pers. comm. 1998). Compared with other cervids on the Qinghai-Tibet plateau, the White-lipped Deer is most likely to be found in open habitats. The species' diet is comprised mostly of grasses, herbs, lichens, leaves and bark of trees and bushes (Takatsuki <em>et al</em>. 1988, Wu and Wang 1999). In summer in alpine meadows, they may feed extensively on sedges (Harris and Miller 1995). The species occurs in seasonally large herds (up to 200–300), and female families (Miura <em>et al</em>. 1989). Males and females live separately except during the breeding season. In winter, they may range in the vicinity of lakes and rivers when food availability is higher (Jia-Yan Wu pers. comm. 1998). Calving is between late May and early July (Koizumi <em>et al</em>. 1993, Yu <em>et al</em>. 1993) following a rut in October (Sheng and Ohtaishi 1993). Gestation estimated at 246 days (Yu <em>et al</em>. 1993).

The species has been heavily depleted, especially due to hunting young individuals for their antlers. Guns have recently been confiscated from most pastoralists living in proximity to White-lipped Deer in China, however, and poaching appears to be on the decline generally (Harris 2007). Throughout its range, competition with livestock is major threat, leading to habitat degradation. Populations have become seriously fragmented as a result of these threats (Koizumi <em>et al</em>. 1993, Ohtaishi and Gao 1990, Harris 2007). The species is extensively farmed for antler production on government farms in China (and in other countries, such as New Zealand).","There is no global population estimate. The species is distributed sporadically at low density, with some 2,000 individuals estimated in Gansu and Qinghai, and 4,000 individuals in Sichuan and the Tibet Autonomous Region (Wu pers. comm. 1990). Wang (1998) estimated a total population of some 7,000 (although Liu and Yin 1993 postulated 5,800 within the Tibetan Autonomous Region only). The species typically lives in high-elevation, remote habitats, and appears to have large, unpredictable ranges.

Although there is no direct data available regarding recent declining population rates, the above-mentioned rate of decline seems reasonable based on the high levels of harvesting and habitat loss. It should also be noted that a widely repeated but poorly documented estimate is that there were 180,000 wild individuals in China in the 1960s and 1970s (Yang <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2003, Zhou <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2004), but Sheng (1998) reported no more than 100,000 within China in the 1990s. No substantive new information on the species' status was received for the re-assessment.","This species is found on barren plateaus at high altitudes, where it occupies meadows, fell-fields, shrublands or fir forests, typically preferring shaded steeper slopes with less human disturbance. In western Sichuan, where it overlaps the distribution of <em>M. berezovskii</em>, the alpine musk deer inhabits the higher elevations (above 2,000 m asl, usually 4,000-4,500 m asl), compared with the 1,0002,500 m altitudinal range of <em>M. berezovskii</em>. <br/><br/>It is predominantly a browser, feeding mainly on shrubs, forbs, leaves, moss, lichens, shoots, grasses, and twigs (Green 1987). The proportion of leaves and tender shoots in the diet is highest in spring and summer, buds and flowers in late summer, and leaves, twigs and flowers of forbs and shrubs later in the year (Wilson and Mittermeier 2011, Syed and Ilyas 2012).<br/><br/>Its main predators include yellow-throated marten, fox, wolf, and lynx. Snow leopard reportedly preys on the species in Nepal (Aryal <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010) It is generally solitary and crepuscular (Harris and Cai 1993). Population density varies from 3.9 /km² in more arid habitats to 71 /km² in areas with higher rainfall. Densities are lower in areas with heavy snow cover and where there are more competitors (goral, serow and domestic cattle).<br/><br/>Breeding occurs primarily in November-December, with the resulting offspring being born from May to June. After birth, young deer lie hidden in secluded areas, essentially independent of their mothers except at feeding times. This hiding period may last up to 2 months. Gestation is variously reported at from 150-195 days (Hayssen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1993) and give birth to one offspring (twins are sometimes reported by documentation is lacking). Fawns wean at 3-4 months, are sexually mature at 16-24 months. <br/><br/>Alpine musk deer is sedentary, tending to remain within defined home ranges. In females these are about 125 acres in size, while males will control a territory that encompasses the ranges of several females, possibly defending it against other males. The species is not known to migrate. Communication between individuals is thought to be based primarily on their sense of smell, due to the high development of the glands of musk deer. It is primarily silent, musk deer will emit a loud double hiss if alarmed.","The musk produced by this genus of primitive deer is highly valued for its cosmetic and alleged pharmaceutical properties, and can fetch U.S. $45,000 per kilogram (2.2 pounds) on the international market. Although this musk, produced in a gland of the males, can be extracted from live animals, most ""musk-gatherers"" kill the animals to remove the entire sac, which yields only about 25 grams (1/40 of a kilogram) of the brown waxy substance. Such poaching is relatively easy to accomplish and difficult to stop using only legal means (Harris 1991, 2007). In Nepal, the increased price of musk deer on the international market has reportedly led to an increase in poaching and trade in the Himalayas (Aryal <em>et al.</em> 2010). Poaching and trade of the species for musk is described as ""unabated"" and the principle threat in Uttarakhand, India (Ilyas 2014).<br/><br/>Musk deer also appear to require dense vegetation, either in the form of intact forests or shrublands, thus excessive forest clearing or grazing can preclude musk deer from using such lands (Yang <em>et al.</em> 2003). Furthermore, grazing of livestock within protected areas may pose a threat to musk deer through both competition and through disease transmission (Aryal <em>et al.</em> 2010).","Estimating population sizes or trends for musk deer is very difficult, and has rarely been done satisfactorily. Population estimates over large-scale areas are subject to considerable uncertainty (and this is exacerbated by uncertainty over taxonomy). A widely repeated but poorly documented estimate is that there were 180,000 individuals in the 1960s and 1970s (Yang <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003, Zhou <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2004), but Sheng (1998) reported no more than 100,000 within China in the 1990s.<br/><br/>Liu and Sheng (2002) estimated population sizes in three Chinese nature reserves in the mid 1990s using extrapolations from counts of pellet groups, but provided few details. They estimated 183227 in the Helan Mountain Nature Reserve in Ningxia, 131-160 in the Shoulu Mountain Nature Reserve in Gansu, and 4,717-5,798 in the Xinglong Mountain Nature Reserve in Gansu. More recent reports suggest that the species has become very rare in the Helan Mountains (Liu, Z.S., East China Normal University pers. comm., 2006) and has been severely depleted since in northwest Yunnan as a result of overexploitation. Snaring has become one of the main threats to the species in northwest Yunnan (Xueyou and Xuelong 2014).<br/><br/>Anecdotal evidence points to a continued decline in abundance within China. Although population estimates contained in Yang <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2003) are unreliable, data on musk purchased by local Traditional Chinese Medicine companies probably reflect real trends, and these suggested dramatic declines in musk deer populations during the 1970s and 1980s, particularly in Sichuan, Yunnan, Qinghai, Tibet, and Shaanxi. <br/><br/>In Nepal, within protected areas the numbers of the species is reportedly increasing (Aryal <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010). There is an estimated 600-800 animals in Sagarmatha National Park at densities of up to 45/km², more than 1000 in Shey-Phoksundo National Park, an estimated 500 animals in Langtang National Park, and it also occurs in Annapurna Conservation Area, Kanchanjunga Conservation Area, Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve Khaptad National Park and Makulu-Barun National Park.

The Institute of Biology of the Mongolian Academy of Science assessed the Mongolian population size in 1986 over 53,000 hectares across 63 units of six provinces, resulting in an estimate of 44,000 individuals. The population size is continuing to decrease: densities fell from six per 5 km<sup>2</sup>, to one per 5 km<sup>2</sup> in one observed population between 1990 and 2000 (Tsendjav and Bujinkhand 2000, Tsendjav 2002). Similar levels of declines due to poaching are believed to have taken place elsewhere within its range. Generation length has been estimated as six years based on data from Nowak (1991). As the causes of this decline, primarily exploitation, is expected to result in a population reduction of at least 30% over the next three generations, <em>Moschus moschiferus</em> qualifies as Vulnerable under Criterion A3d, and as well as A2d and A4d because of past declines. Further research could show that the species is declining more seriously than has been supposed, and could possible qualify for listing as Endangered.","Inhabiting mountainous taiga (broadleaf and needle forest), these animals are typically found in forests of dense birch (<em>Betula</em> spp.) and larch (<em>Larix</em> spp.), and shrub-covered slopes in sub-alpine zones (Dulamtseren 1977, Dulamtseren <em>et al</em>. 1989, Tsendjav 2002). In Russia it inhabits the mid-mountain belt where it prefers dark coniferous forest with dense shrubs and rocky outcrops, using such rocky areas to escape from predators (Prohod’ko 2002). However, lichens are the main part of Siberian Musk Deer diet, accounting for up to 99% of the food intake in winter. During the rest of the year the percentage of lichen in the diet is still high, but these deer also consume grasses, leaves and mushrooms. When feeding it is able to climb on inclined trunks up to 3-4 m above ground. Population density is highly correlated with the availability of food and hiding places. The average population density is about 0.6 animals per square kilometre, although under favourable conditions this may be as high as 4-8.5 animals per square kilometre (Prohod’ko 2002). It has a thick coat for insulation and is well adapted for walking through deep snow.  The species is preyed upon by a suite of predators including lynx, wolverine, yellow-throated marten, and rarely wolf, tiger, and bear. When chased, musk deer head for rocky terrain, and will try to reach an inaccessible crag or a shelter. If neither is available, the animal begins to run in circles. Although they can run exceptionally fast, musk deer tire after only 200-300 metres.<br/><br/>It is solitary, though it sometimes occurs in small groups (no more than three individuals) of a female with her young. In the Altai, family groups consist usually of an adult permanent pair and the young of the year. The territory of female and young lies within the territory of a male. Sometimes the group includes young males up to two years old, that are submissive to the adult male, but actively participate in making and protecting common territory (Prohod’ko 2002). The species is primarily active at dusk and dawn. While foraging, a musk deer may travel 3-7 km per night, generally returning to the same spot (a ""lair"") every morning. Individuals inhabit home ranges between 200 and 300 hectares in size, sticking to the boundaries steadfastly. The size of the home range decreases markedly during the second half of winter. Seasonal migrations are minimal if present at all. Reproduction starts in December, although some females do not mate until March (Prohod’ko 2002). Females gestate for just over 6 months, and give birth to 1-3 offspring, usually in May or June. Young wean at 3-4 months, and are mature at 15-17 months. Animals live in the wild for 10-14 years.","As the common name suggests, males secrete musk from a preputial gland (the “musk-pod”). This musk forms the basis for many perfumes, and is highly valued for traditional medicines (Wemmer 1998). Each male produces only around 25 g of musk (Dulamtseren <em>et al</em>. 1989, Tsendjav 2002). Although this musk can be extracted from live animals, most ""musk-gatherers"" kill the animals to remove the entire sac.<br/><br/>Illegal, unsustainable hunting for musk is the principal threat to this species. An estimated 25,000 adult males were killed through harvesting and illegal hunting between 1990 and 2001 (Homes 2004). As hunting is often indiscriminate of sex and age, four to five Siberian Musk Deer are estimated to be killed per musk-pod harvested (Green 1987). As cheaper, synthetic alternatives for making perfumes are becoming more popular, use of musk in the perfume industry is decreasing, but its value for cardiac, circulatory and respiratory traditional medicines remains high. During the 1970s, the international market value of musk reached up to US$45,000 per kg. Between 1995 and 2001, the number of traders in musk increased six-fold, following a similar increase in the market price of musk-pods (Zahler <em>et al</em>. 2004).&#160;<br/><br/>Resource extraction such as mining is not causing a substantial loss of habitat at present, but the resulting human disturbance from this activity does constitute a threat. Habitat fragmentation may also threaten the species (Tsendjav and Bujinkhand 2000).","During the 1920s and 1930s numbers were sharply reduced through hunting. In the 1970s the Mongolian population size was estimated to be between 60,000 and 80,000 animals (Dulamtseren 1977). In 1986, the Institute of Biology of the Mongolian Academy of Science assessed Musk Deer population sizes in over 53,000 hectares across 63 units of six provinces, resulting in an estimate of approximately 44,000 individuals.

Likewise, all populations in Russia are considered declining. Population estimates from the Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife in 1999 put the Sakhalin population at about 600-650 individuals (still declining), the Eastern Siberian population at about 27,000-30,000 individuals, and the population in the Russian Far East at up to 150,000 individuals (K.

Although there are no direct data available regarding recent declining population rates, the above-mentioned rate of decline seems reasonable based on the high levels of harvesting and habitat loss. No new information was received in 2014 to enable a full re-assessment of this species.","This species is poorly known; however, its natural history is likely similar to that of <em>M. berezovskii</em> and <em>M. moschiferus</em> (Smith and Xie 2008). It presumably therefore inhabits coniferous or broad-leaved forests, or mixed forests at high elevations. &#160;According to Smith and Xie (2008), it is more likely than other musk deer to produce twins.  Females mature rapidly and are capable of breeding in their first year of life.","The major threats to this species include habitat loss and hunting, and it is especially at risk due to its limited distribution (Smith and Xie 2008).

None of the indications that the species inhabited other countries can be shown to have any compelling basis and some are clearly in error. Thus the species is considered a single-country endemic, to Thailand, where it is certainly Extinct.","The species inhabited seasonally inundated swampy plains with long grass, cane, and shrubs; it apparently avoided forest (Giles 1937), although there seems to be no information on where animals went at the height of the wet season, when much of the dry-season range was under water.","Commercial production of rice for export began in the late nineteenth century in Thailand’s central plains, leading to the loss of nearly all the grassland and swamp areas that this deer depended on, and greatly fragmented what remained. Intensive hunting pressure at the turn of the 19th–20th century restricted the species further and it disappeared in the 1930s. Schomburgk’s Deer was prominent in the antlers sought by the Chinese medicine trade (Harper 1945). During the wet season, animals marooned on higher ground were hunted readily with spears from boats (Harper 1945), no doubt hastening the species' decline.","Schomburgk’s Deer was apparently “not uncommon” in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century and herds still occurred around 1900–1910 (Harper 1945), but the species underwent a very rapid decline: Harper (1945) stated that it was never seen in the wild state by a European (although this may be better taken as a lack of such reports, because Europeans working, for example, on the Paknampo railway in the early days would almost surely have seen and hunted these deer; G.J. Galbreath <em>in litt</em>. 2008). The usually successful hunter Arthur S. Vernay made three trips to Thailand specifically for the species, the first in 1920, but failed to see the species. There are some hundreds of skulls, frontlet and antlers in collections (Harper 1945), but the species is now extinct.",,"<em>Rucervus schomburgki</em> was endemic to Thailand and is thought to have become extinct when the last captive individual was killed in 1938; the last known wild animals were killed in 1932 near Sai Yoke and Kwae Yai, although this date was not universally accepted at the time (Harper 1945, Lekagul and McNeely 1988). The recent range in Thailand seems to have lain within 13°30′–18°N, 98°30′–102°E, comprising the central plain of Thailand (Giles 1937, Harper 1945, G.J. Galbreath <em>in litt</em>. 2008). Attempts to circumscribe the range have, however, been bedevilled by a surprisingly large number of statements of occurrence elsewhere.<br/><br/>Statements of occurrence in the Sanda Valley, Yunnan, China by Sclater (1891: 180) and Bentham (1908) led to this locality being included without any caveat by Grubb (2005), and relate to both a frontlet and a skin. However, Sclater (1891) listed the set of antlers as of unknown locality, and the skin has a ""?"" mark that makes its Sanda Valley locality no more than tentative (G.J. Galbreath <em>in litt</em>. 2008). Then, Bentham (1908) indicated that the antlers had been collected in the Sanda Valley by John Anderson in 1878, without giving explicit source for this statement. In fact, Anderson was in the Sanda Valley in 1868, not 1878, and moreover recorded no such antlers in his thorough write-up of zoological results of his Yunnan expeditions. This locality assignment for the antlers should be seen as an error of Bentham's, presumably stemming from the earlier, tentative, assignment of Sanda Valley to the deer skin Sclater also reported (G.J. Galbreath <em>in litt</em>. 2008). Pocock (1943) included under distribution of the species “N. Siam [Thailand] and, it has been alleged, Yunnan and Lao PDR”, indicating his own concern with the Sanda valley ‘evidence’. The Shan states (Myanmar) have also figured as part of the species’s range, e.g. by Blanford (1891: 540). Reference to historical occurrence in these areas seems to stem from Brooke (1876), who wrote, based on written communication from a Dr Campbell of the Bangkok British Consulate) in reference to new specimens sent to him that "". . . all specimens were procured in northern Siam, probably even in the tributary states named Laos and Shan"". Campbell seems to have based his opinion at least partly on what professional indigenous hunters told him or others. Brooke gave no definition of ""northern Siam"" (conceivably it simply meant some way north of Bangkok), and Lao PDR in this context could well have included part or all of the Korat Plateau and other areas in present-day Thailand which are ethnically Lao and were often referred to in the past by terms such as ‘Siamese Laos’. It is not even clear that Lao PDR and Shan were not just speculation on the part of Campbell and/or Brooke (G.J. Galbreath <em>in litt</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>Not surprisingly, Harper (1945) considered the Shan states report to be “highly indefinite” and occurrence in “Indo-China” [presumably = Lao PDR, Cambodia and Viet Nam] to be “in error”, although he took the ‘Sanda valley’ frontlet as “apparently authentic”, perhaps being focussed on the identity (which is not in doubt) rather than the provenance (presumably assuming that the association with the highly-respected Anderson’s name was enough). A more modern reanalysis concluded that ""the northern Thailand, Myanmar, Yunnan, and Lao PDR range extensions suggested in the literature are based on erroneous or quite inconclusive items of evidence"", sometimes perhaps influenced by a switch of Thai names between Eld’s and Schomburgk’s Deer by Flower (1900) (G.J. Galbreath <em>in litt</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>Two loose antlers, presumed to be a pair, of Schomburgk’s Deer photographed in Phongsali province, far northern Lao PDR, in 1991 were a most surprising find. This has been taken to suggest the species might survive, at least into the 1980s, and that it did indeed occur in Lao PDR (Schroering 1995) and it was even taken as sufficient evidence that the species was not extinct by MacPhee and Flemming (1999). However, while these are indeed Schomburgk’s Deer antlers, it has proven impossible to recover a consistent story from their owner of the antlers’ origin (e.g. Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999) and there is no compelling evidence that they had come from a recently killed animal, rather than being decades-old stock still in trade; Williams (1941) noted that even then that Schomburgk’s Deer antlers ""keep coming down to Bangkok from Paknampo and Korat by railway amongst collections of ordinary deer-horns consigned to Bangkok Chinamen . . . the horns are probably quite old . . ."" and Schomburgk’s Deer antlers are still in trade in Thailand (Srikosamatara <em>et al</em>. 1992). The owner of the antlers was, according to his daughter, a middleman trader in wildlife parts sourced from all over Indochina (W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. 2008, based on visit in 1996). Consequently, while remains of the species have been seen in Lao PDR in recent times, they cannot be taken as evidence that the species survives today, or ever occurred in Lao PDR.","Relics of this extinct species (usually antlers) are still traded to a limited extent. During its last few decades of existence Schomburgk's Deer was hunted heavily, presumably for meat, and certainly for antlers which went into the Chinese medicine trade (e.g. Williams 1941, Harper 1945).",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"As an extinct species there are no appropriate conservation measures. The indication that a remnant population might still survive (Schroering 1995 and <em>in litt</em>. as reported in Grubb 2005, MacPhee and Flemming 1999) was followed up by investigation, independently by several people, of Phongsali province, Lao PDR, by field survey and interview. This failed to find any further evidence of the species there or to elicit a consistent story of the origin of the antlers (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, per J.W. Duckworth <em>in litt</em>. 2008). Given regional trends in Schomburgk’s Deer’s sole known habitat, non-forest floodplains (its massive conversion to agriculture over the last 150 years) it is unlikely that the species could survive. However, any future indication of its existence should be followed up carefully. If by chance the species does survive, legislation giving it the highest levels of protection (in whatever country it was found), and an assessment of specific conservation needs would be imperative.",Indomalayan,last captive 1938; last wild animal known in 1932,false,false,Global
81069636,23049,Vulpes bengalensis,Least Concern,,2016,2016-03-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Indian Fox is endemic to the Indian subcontinent. Although widespread, it occurs at low densities throughout its range, and populations can undergo fluctuations due to prey availability and disease. Due to loss of short grassland-scrub habitat to intensive agriculture, industry and development projects the Indian Fox population is likely to be experiencing a slow decline. However, any decline is unlikely to be sufficient to warrant the listing of the species in a threatened category and the species is currently assessed as Least Concern.","The Indian Fox prefers semi-arid, flat to undulating terrain, scrub and grassland habitats where it is easy to hunt and dig dens. It avoids dense forests, steep terrain, tall grasslands and true deserts (Johnsingh and Jhala 2004). The species is relatively common in areas of low rainfall, where the vegetation is typically scrub, thorn or dry deciduous forests, or short grasslands (Rodgers <em>et al.</em> 2000). In the Indian peninsula, the species is restricted to plains and open scrub forest. Home ranges have been estimated at about 2 km<sup>2&#160;</sup>(Maurya 2012). Diet mostly consists of arthropods, rodents, reptiles, fruits and birds, in that order of occurrence in scats (Home and Jhala 2009). Pups are born between December and February, but can be as late as March. Short resource rich grassland patches in an agro-pastoral landscape are preferred for denning and pup rearing (Punjabi <em>et al</em>. 2013).","Although the Indian Fox is widespread, it occurs generally at low densities throughout its range, and populations can undergo major fluctuations due to prey availability and disease (rabies and canine distemper virus have been recorded to cause local population declines in western India). They can tolerate some human disturbance, although with expanding human populations and continued development of grasslands for agricultural and industrial uses, the habitat of the Indian Fox is continuously being depleted. The combination of above factors along with disease and/or natural mortality could potentially cause localized extirpations. In certain states like Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan, Indian Fox habitat is widespread with minimal threats, while in other states like Karnataka and Tamil Nadu the habitats of the Indian Fox are under threat (Johnsingh and Jhala 2004).","Although widespread, the Indian Fox is nowhere abundant in its range, with densities greatest in semi-arid grasslands of peninsular&#160;India. Densities seem to track rodent abundance (Johnsingh and Jhala 2004), which fluctuates widely between years in the species' prime habitat (arid and semi-arid zones) (Prakash 1975, Tripathi <em>et al.</em> 1992). Densities of breeding pairs ranged from 0.25–0.4/km<sup>2</sup> in the Kutch area of Gujarat (Maurya 2012).",Decreasing,"The Indian Fox is endemic to the Indian subcontinent. It ranges from the foothills of the Himalayas in Nepal to the southern tip of the Indian peninsula (but it is absent from the Western and Eastern Ghats).

Occurs up to 1,500 m in Nepal and north-eastern India (Gompper and Vanak 2006).","There are no known commercial uses for the Indian Fox, although there is limited localized hunting and trade for skin, tail, teeth and claws for medicinal and charm purposes.

It almost qualifies as threatened under criterion C1.","The Brown Hyaena is found in dry areas, generally with annual rainfall less than 100 mm, particularly along the coast, semi-desert, open scrub and open woodland savanna with a maximum rainfall up to about 700 mm. It shows an ability to survive close to urban areas. It is predominantly nocturnal in its activity (Hulsman <em>et al</em>. 2010). The&#160;Brown Hyaena&#160;is independent of drinking water, but needs some type of cover in which to lie up during the day. For this it favours rocky, mountainous areas with bush cover in the bushveld areas of South Africa (Skinner 1976). It is primarily a scavenger of a wide range of vertebrate remains, which is supplemented by wild fruit and other plant material, insects, birds’ eggs, and the occasional small animal which is killed; their impact on domestic livestock is usually very small (Mills 1998, 1990; Maude and Mills 2005; Schiess-Meier <em>et al</em>. 2007). On Namibian farmlands, Brown Hyaenas often scavenge from leopard kills (Stein <em>et al.</em> 2013). Along the Namib Desert Coast, Brown Hyaenas are successful hunters of Cape Fur Seal pups (e.g. Wiesel 2006, Wiesel 2010). Populations of Brown Hyaenas in non-protected areas comprise a significant proportion of the global population, suggesting that such areas are likely to be important for their sustained conservation (Kent and Hill 2013, Lindsey <em>et al</em>. 2013, Stein <em>et al.</em> 2013). Working in areas occupied by pastoralist herders, Maude and Mills              (2005) found, that, although Brown Hyaenas feed on carcasses of livestock, there was no evidence to suggest that Brown Hyaenas hunted livestock, or any other significantly sized mammals. Thus the persecution of them because of perceived livestock predation is unjustified. The dietary benefit derived by the Brown Hyaenas from the presence of subsistence pastoralists and their livestock carcasses, may be the primary reason that Brown Hyaena populations are viable in cattle areas (Maude and Mills&#160;2005).","Outside protected areas, the Brown Hyaena may come into conflict with humans, and they are often shot, poisoned, trapped and hunted with dogs in predator eradication or control programmes, or inadvertently killed in non-selective control programs (Mills 1998). Brown Hyaena body parts are used in traditional medicine and Brown Hyaenas are also often unintentional victims of lethal problem animal  control through poisons and poaching through snares (I. Wiesel, C. Edwards, L. Boast and R. Yarnell pers. comms. 2014). Lethal control remains the most predominant form of conflict resolution. The Brown Hyaena is regarded as a threat to livestock in some areas, and over 72% of livestock owners in Namibia believe that the Brown Hyaena is responsible for losses (Lindsey <em>et al</em>. 2013), despite the finding that Brown Hyaenas very seldom prey on livestock (Maude and Mills&#160;2005). In South Africa's North West Province 40% of livestock owners regard the Brown Hyaena as a problem animal (Thorn 2008), but in the North West Province, only 6% of surveyed farmers admit to having killed&#160;Brown Hyaenas&#160;on their property (St John <em>et al</em>. 2011). Persecution in small stock areas in Namibia has lead to the local extinction of Brown Hyaenas in the southeastern parts of that country, where increasing conflict may lead to further population decline.","The total population size on the continent has been estimated as at a minimum of 5,000 to 8,000 individuals, with Botswana having the largest population (an estimated 3,900 animals; ,Hofer and Mills 1998b). However, numbers for Botswana may be higher, as one density study for the Central Kalahari Game Reserve, Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park and Makgadikgadi Pans estimates the park's Brown Hyaena population at 2,253 animals (G. Maude pers. comm.). Winterbach and Winterbach (2014) estimate Botswana's total population in 2014 between 2,799 and 5,271 animals. &#160;A recent national population estimate for Namibia puts the number of Brown Hyaenas at 566-2,440 animals (Stein <em>et al</em>. 2013). Thorn (2008, unpublished PhD thesis) estimates South Africa's population at 1,007 (31-2,316) animals. No recent population size estimates are available for Zimbabwe, Angola, Mozambique, Lesotho or Swaziland. Mean density of Brown Hyaenas on farmlands in Botswana was 2.3 per 100 km<sup>2</sup> based on camera trap data, and 2.88 per 100&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;based on spoor surveys (Kent and Hill 2013). Thorn <em>et al</em>. (2009)                     estimated population density in Pilanesberg National Park, South Africa, at 2.8 per 100&#160;km<sup>2</sup>.      			 				 					<p><br/></p>",Stable,"This species is endemic to southern Africa with a marginal extension into the arid parts of southwestern Angola, southeastern Botswana, and the northern and western Cape regions of the Republic of South Africa. Almost 90% of the Brown Hyena population in Botswana occurs in the Southern Conservation Zone (Winterbach <em>et al</em>. 2014). The range of the Brown Hyaena has shrunk significantly since the end of the 18th century when it was last recorded from Table Bay in the extreme southwest of the continent (Hofer and Mills 1998a, Mills 1990). They remain widespread in southern Africa, and in recent years in South Africa have been recorded from the extreme south in the Western Cape (Gansbaai and Bredasdorp), possibly vagrants from a small population in the Little Karoo (Yarnell <em>et al</em>. 2013). Thorn <em>et al</em>. (2011a) found that Brown Hyena distribution in northern South Africa was larger than in previous estimates. However, in farm land in this same area, Brown Hyaena occupancy was estimated at 0.748 (±SE 0.1), and estimated overall density in agricultural land (0.15/100&#160;km<sup>2</sup>, ±SE 0.08), which was an order of magnitude lower than in protected areas (Thorn <em>et al</em>. 2011b). Boast and Houser (2012) also found that Brown Hyena distribution in Ghanzi, Botswana was larger than previously believed. Several re-introductions have taken place in South Africa's Eastern Cape (e.g., Shamwari Game Reserve; Slater and Muller 2014), and sightings have since been recorded there (e.g., Hayward <em>et al</em>. 2007). Other range expansions have also been recorded from South Africa (Thorn <em>et al</em>. 2011a). Recent studies from Zimbabwe show a range expansion into the north/northwest region of the country (E. van der Meer pers. comm. 2014) and into the east (R. Groom pers. comm. 2014). They seem to be absent from southeast Namibia (I. Wiesel pers. comm. 2014) and the Zambezi region (former Caprivi Strip; L. Hanssen pers. comm. 2014). No recent records are available from the central and western parts of South Africa's Northern Cape Province.

A recent study from Botswana suggested that a significant proportion of the global Brown Hyaena population is found in non-protected areas, and that these animals can also tolerate land-use changes under some circumstances (Kent and Hill 2013). Boast and Houser (2012) found that Brown Hyaenas occurred evenly on game and cattle farms in Botswana, and in Namibia 54.5% of farm owners reported Brown Hyaena presence (Lindsey <em>et al</em>. 2013).

These vary in severity between regions, and in some areas considerably exceed the threshold for Vulnerable. In the last three generations (taken to be 24–30 years), declines in mainland South-east Asia (Viet Nam, Lao PDR, Thailand, Cambodia, Myanmar, Malaysia), Bangladesh, and possibly Borneo and Sumatra have exceeded 50%, probably by a substantial margin. Despite this Sambar remains common in some localized logged, unprotected areas on Borneo, such as the Hose Mountains of Sarawak (where a national park is proposed but not yet enforced), but only where human access is difficult. The overall decline rate in India has been less, given the presence of large populations in a fair number of well-secured protected areas which have probably remained stable, but a decline rate averaging 30% is reasonable in India outside these areas (i.e. in the less effective protected areas and outside the protected areas network), and in Sri Lanka and Nepal. The situation in China is unclear as in some areas, for example Hainan, population recovery may be occurring, whilst major declines in other regions may have taken place prior to the 24–30 year assessment window; the population on Taiwan appears to be relatively stable. Although declines seem to be reversing very locally in a few sites, these numbers are a very small proportion of the whole population. There is no indication that declines will, at the species level, slow until populations are extinguished outside well-secured protected areas, which currently comprise only a small proportion of protected areas holding the species. Current trends of wild meat and antler marketing in South-east Asia and China suggest declines have probably sped up in some areas especially Lao PDR, Cambodia and Viet Nam. Since the 2008 assessment trends in wildlife exploitation and natural habitat conversion in mainland Southeast Asia, have if anything increased, thus although the relative size of the Southeast Asian population subcomponent has probably decreased compared with that in South Asia, the rate of decline has probably increased. The global population trend is still considered to be a decline somewhere between 30 and 50 % over three generations, for the past, present and future.&#160;The fact that Sambar is at least locally common in a number of high profile protected areas, such as Khao Yai National Park, Thailand and Cat Tien National Park, Viet Nam, and is commonly kept captive and proliferates in menageries in the region, was probably a significant factor in the failure to recognize the plight of the species prior to the 2008 reassessment. These same factors no doubt still to some degree cloud the issue.","No large Indian ungulate has adapted itself to a wider variety of forest types and environmental conditions than has Sambar (Schaller 1967). Within India, Sambar occurs in the thorn and arid forests of Gujarat and Rajasthan, in the moist and dry deciduous forests throughout peninsular India, in the pine and oak forests at the Himalayan foothills, and in the evergreen and semi-evergreen forests of northeastern India and the Western Ghats (Sankar and Acharya 2004, N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). Outside India it extends into temperate-latitude and alpine-zone woodlands of Taiwan (Lin, C.-Y. and Lee, L.-L. pers. comm. 2008). This habitat flexibility is permitted by its broad diet: Sambar has been documented to eat 130–180 species of plants in India alone (Schaller 1967, Johnsingh and Sankar 1991, N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008), with food requirements less specialised than those of other deer (Schaller 1967). Sambar grazes or browses depending upon the forage available at that time (Schaller 1967, Richardson 1972, Martin 1977, Bentley 1978, Dinerstein 1979, Kelton and Skipworth 1987, Ngampongsai 1987, Sankar 1994, Semiadi <em>et al</em>. 1995). Across the very wide altitudinal range occupied in Taiwan, the diet varies reflecting major changes in plant communities (Lin, C.-Y. and Lee, L.-L. pers. comm. 2008). Sambar was found to live in much higher densities in moist than in dry deciduous forests of Nagarahole National Park (Karanth and Sunquist 1992) and there are no doubt also patterns of habitat selection across the rest of its range. Although the highest densities of Sambar so far recorded were in the semi-arid forests of Ranthambore (Kumar 2000), across most of its Indian range Sambar seems to thrive best in well-watered, moist deciduous hilly terrain (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>The Sambar occurs up to at least 3,825 m on Siouguluan Mountain, the highest peak of the Central Mountains in Taiwan; elsewhere on the island it ranges down to 150 m asl, mostly living at 2,000–3,500 m (Lin, C.-Y. and Lee, L.-L. pers. comm. 2008). It occurs up to 3,000 m on Gunung Kinabalu, Sabah, Borneo (Payne <em>et al</em>. 1985). In Myanmar, recent camera-trap photographs spanned the range of 0–2,150 m asl (Saw Htun pers. comm. 2008). Sambar is largely restricted to hilly terrain in the Terai Arc Landscape (Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004), although how much this reflects real habitat selection and how much it is an artificial pattern produced by human effects (habitat conversion and hunting) is unclear. More widely in India, there does seem to be a marked preference for undulating terrain (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). Kushwaha <em>et al</em>. (2004) found that in Kumaon Himalaya (India), Sambar usage was greater of the higher than the lower altitude area. However, it makes wide use of plains areas elsewhere, where these have not been destroyed, e.g. the Hukaung Valley in Myanmar (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008).In Borneo, while Payne <em>et al</em>. (1985) considered Sambar “most common in secondary forests of gently-sloping terrain” they also knew of occurrence in “tall dipterocarp forests on steep terrain and in swamp forests”. In Thung Yai, Thailand, Sambar signs were twice as abundant in lowland forest as in montane forest, although this difference was not statistically significant (Steinmetz <em>et al</em>. 2008).&#160;Across seven sites in Thailand, places where sambar was detected had shallower slopes, more open habitat, were closer to streams, closer to roads and villages, and had lower rainfall (Lynam <em>et al. </em>2012).In Southeast Asian regions of dense evergreen closed-canopy forest, Sambar is highly tolerant of forest degradation: indeed, much higher numbers are found in encroached stands than in pristine forests, if hunting is under control (Rijksen 1978, Heydon 1994, Stuebing 1995, Davies <em>et al</em>. 2001). In Sabah, Sambar was camera-trapped in both mature and young forest stands (Matsubayashi and Sukor 2005). All the remaining Lao populations are centred around areas with extensive open, or at least broken, habitat amid forest (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999), and the general paucity of records from the interiors of large blocks of closed-canopy evergreen and semi-evergreen forests, which generally support the least depleted large mammal populations, probably reflects natural patterns of habitat occupation (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Similarly, in extensive tracts of deciduous dipterocarp forest the species occurs primarily around patches of denser habitats, and this seems to be a natural rather than hunting-led pattern (Timmins and Ou 2001). In this sense, in Indochina Northern Red Muntjac <em>Muntiacus vaginalis</em> is much more tolerant and versatile than is Sambar. In southern and central India where much of the forest is deciduous, Sambar is a true forest ungulate and conspicuously avoids disturbed and open forests, and is highly sensitive to any sort of forest resource extractive activities (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). Kushwaha <em>et al</em>. (2004) found that in Kumaon Himalaya (India), Sambar was primarily in areas of high tree and herb density with low shrub density. O'Brien <em>et al</em>. (2003) found no statistically significant difference in Sambar abundance between areas within 1 km inside the boundary of Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park, Sumatra, and those deep in the interior of the park. Caution is needed in inferring that there is truly no association of Sumatran Sambar with forest edges (which would be astonishing by comparison with its habitat use elsewhere) because the study does not specify whether this ‘non-significant’ result might simply reflect methodological factors rather than a genuine lack of biological effect (see, e.g., Johnson 1999). Despite the population rises that occur in post-logging forest, there is no evidence that Sambar can survive landscape-level conversion to exotic plantations or other non-forest land-uses, although many live in coconut plantations (G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2008) and it is relatively common in immature <em>Acacia mangium</em> plantations within the matrix of plantation and natural forest of the Sarawak Planted Forests area, Bintulu (B. Giman pers. comm. 2008).&#160;Camera trapping in oil palm plantations adjacent to Danum Valley in Sabah suggest that the species does not utilize plantations (Yue and J. Brodie unpublished data).A study of coffee estates around Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary, India, recorded Sambar only in those coffee areas within 1 km of the sanctuary’s boundary (Bali <em>et al</em>. 2007). In forest protected areas of Thailand such as Khao Yai National Park and Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary, Sambar populations are often concentrated around anthropogenic grass and scrub (e.g. sites of former villages) rather than in the forest itself (Trisurat <em>et al</em>. 1996; Lynam <em>et al</em>. 2001) and this also seems to be true on remote parts of the Bolaven Plateau of south Lao PDR (Evans <em>et al</em>. 2000). In the Annamite mountains of Lao PDR and Viet Nam, Sambar seems often to be associated with degraded valley bottom areas, largely the result of long human influence: although the effects of a permanent water source and differences in terrain in determining distribution are difficult to disentangle (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>Sambar regularly visits salt licks (e.g. Matsubayashi <em>et al</em>. 2007), perhaps especially when growing new antlers. This predictability exposes it to high levels of hunting, where this is not effectively controlled. It seems that within an area, not all sort of licks are visited. At the Seima Biodivesity Conservation Area, Cambodia, Sambar photographs were initially very few at mineral lick camera-traps. But in 2007, cameras placed on trails and at some permanent water sources (especially in semi-evergreen forest) recorded Sambar much more often. Checking tracks at more than 40 licks indicated that some were used by Sambar and Red Muntjac, but not Gaur <em>Bos gaurus</em> or Asian Elephant <em>Elephas maximus</em>, while the big ones with many cattle and elephant prints had few Sambar prints (E. Pollard pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>Sambar was considered to be mostly nocturnal by Kawanishi and Sunquist (2004), to show ‘no pattern’ (meaning unclear; perhaps intended to imply no significant variation through the 24-hour cycle, although this is itself a pattern) by O’Brien <em>et al</em>. (2003), and to be cathemeral by van Schaik and Griffiths (1996). In fact, its activity pattern may vary across sites, but in general it is mostly crepuscular, with significant nocturnal activity as well (Schaller 1967; J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). Sambar is essentially non-social, stable groups being at most family associations (Schaller 1967; Karanth and Sunquist 1992). However, it is often in groups, presumably temporary, of 12–30 in dry deciduous and semi-arid forests of India (e.g. Bandipur, Pench, Melghat and Ranthambore) (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008), and the same is true around the secondary grasslands within Khao Yai National Park, Thailand (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). During peak summer, such associations of up to 80–100 near large waterbodies are not uncommon in Pench in central India (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). A detailed review of information on grouping in Sambar is in Sankar and Acharya (2004). Results from many areas show a strong bias in sex ratio to females, perhaps reflecting selective predation; alternatively, stags may be more vulnerable to stress (Sankar and Acharya 2004).<br/><br/>Breeding is rather seasonal in most areas where studied, for example Schaller (1967) reported that in Kanha the rut spreads over a period of at least seven months with a peak in November–December. Stags during the rut sometimes can cover large distances, up to 10–20 km in one night. Further information for India is reviewed in Sankar and Acharya (2004). The bucks of Formosan Sambar have a seasonal antler cycle, and the mating season is from June to January with a peak in September–October. Males wallow and mark with scent glands in this season. Fawns are born (usually singly) from March to August, with a peak in May and June (Lin, C.-Y. and Lee, L.-L. pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>Predation appears to be the major cause of Sambar mortality. In Bandipur, Sambar is one of the most important prey in terms of the biomass taken by Tiger <em>Panthera tigris</em> (31%), Leopard <em>P. pardus</em> (8%) and Dhole <em>C. alpinus</em> (13%) (Andheria <em>et al</em>. 2007). In Bandipur Sambar remains were found in about 22.3% of Tiger faeces, 6.1% of Leopard faeces and 7.3% of Dhole faeces (Andheria <em>et al</em>. 2007). In adjoining Nagarahole, proportion of Sambar in Tiger’s diet was about 25–29%, derived from faeces and kill data respectively (Karanth and Sunquist 1995). In Tadoba-Andhari, Sambar together with Gaur contributed to nearly 70% of the prey biomass consumed by Tiger, whereas in Pench-Maharashtra it was 80% (Karanth and Kumar 2005). Sambar occurred in 50% of Tiger scats in Pench-Maharashtra (Karanth and Kumar 2005). In well protected forest reserves where different body-sized ungulates are abundantly available, Sambar together with Gaur are selectively predated by Tiger.","Habitat encroachment and hunting are both widespread in the Sundaic region and in much of the rest of Sambar’s range. Indeed, these two threats are often associated and all Borneo’s ungulates suffer from the increased hunting that often accompanies logging (Bennett and Dahaban 1995, Bennett and Gumal 2001), such that hunting to local extinction is the chief detrimental effect of logging on ungulates in Sarawak (Bennett and Gumal 2001). This conclusion probably is applicable across the range of Sambar, within which it is heavily hunted (e.g. Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Walston 2001, Tungittiplakorn and Dearden 2002, Linkie <em>et al</em>. 2003, Santiapillai and Wijeyamohan 2003, Tilson <em>et al</em>. 2004, Rao <em>et al</em>. 2005, Steinmetz <em>et al</em>. 2008, Saw Htun pers. comm. 2008). It is among the most sought-after wild meats in Indonesia (Semiadi 2005), Sarawak (Belden Giman pers. comm. 2008), and Viet Nam (B. Long pers. comm. 2008), and during 1988–1993 it was a common and preferred food in rural Lao PDR (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Table 1), and is probably near the top of chosen wild meats throughout most of its range (GMA Indonesia workshop); however, it is less favoured in Taiwan compared with Formosan Serow <em>Capricornis crispus</em> and Reeves’s Muntjac <em>Muntiacus reevesi</em> (Chang Shih-Wei pers. comm. 2008). However, it is now so rare in Nam Ha National Protected Area, Lao PDR, that a more recent hunting study found it to be eaten only rarely (Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2003). In Viet Nam, muntjac meat is now often served in wildlife restaurants as Sambar, because real Sambar meat is now so difficult to procure (B. Long pers. comm. 2008). These declines in consumption are probably representative of all Lao PDR and Viet Nam, and of increasing proportions of the rest its range, reflecting population losses (see Population).<br/><br/>There are major, ongoing, declines in at least Viet Nam, Lao PDR, Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia, Myanmar, Bangladesh and Nepal, and probably Sri Lanka and Indonesia (see Populations) which can plausibly only be driven by hunting, because suitable habitat for Sambar is abundant in these countries but is almost or actually bereft of the species. Even in India, poaching has seriously depleted the abundance of large mammals in most areas; even in high-profile areas such a Corbett Tiger Reserve and Rajaji National Park there are still some instances of poaching (Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004). An intensive study of hunting on mammals in two Hmong villages of northern Thailand classified quarry species into tiers representing the sequence of loss through overhunting; Sambar fell in the second tier (aside, e.g., big cats <em>Panthera</em>) in the extinction sequence (Tungittiplakorn and Dearden 2002). This study found that Sambar persisted anomalously long in one place under an “exceptional village wildlife hunting regulation promulgated by the village headman until 1994”, but was generally extinct in the landscape. A study at Nagarahole National Park compared an area which was only moderately hunted with a heavily hunted site, but found no significant difference in Sambar densities between the two areas (Madhusudan and Karanth 2002). This was speculated to reflect the greater difficulty of hunting Sambar (highly dispersed and usually in rather thick vegetation), despite it being a prized species, than, particularly, Chital <em>Axis axis</em>, a herding species often out in the open, and the benefit to poachers of getting in, making a kill, and getting back out again as fast as possible to reduce detection chances; therefore, this pattern seems to have arisen through hunter choice. In the context of Indochina, even the heavily-hunted site would, however, rank as lightly hunted (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008, based on visit and discussion). For these two reasons, their finding, of an apparent high resilience of Sambar to hunting, is not applicable to the rest of the species' range (particularly outside well-secured protected areas). However, somewhat reflecting this, Sambar’s status in non-Sundaic South-east Asia (still widespread but in ongoing steep decline) relative to other large deer ecologically more similar to Chital (herding; often outside dense forest), Eld’s Deer <em>Rucervus eldii</em> and Hog Deer <em>Axis porcinus</em> (extinct across most of their former range through former steep declines) does indeed suggest a broad applicability of a conclusion that Sambar is somewhat less rapidly reduced by hunting than are other sympatric deer, excepting muntjacs <em>Munitacus</em> spp.<br/><br/>Deer are hunted in India using snares, dogs, and guns (Jathanna <em>et al</em>. 2003; Kumara and Singh 2004) and these methods are general across their range. Some hunting is for village consumption of meat, but most (at least in South-east Asia) is probably sold commercially, to the affluent urban classes (e.g. Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Walston 2001, Kumara and Singh 2004), and to itinerant labourers, such as logging crews in at least Sarawak (Bennett and Gunal 2001) and gold-diggers and rattan-cutters in Myanmar (in Myanmar (<span lang=""EN-US"">A. Lynam pers. comm. 2014 based on observations in 2002,&#160;J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). Such commercially-driven hunting causes major declines (e.g. Steinmetz <em>et al</em>. 2008) because the market is limitless. Adult males suffer additionally because antlers are widely displayed as trophies and are used in traditional medicine (e.g. Martin 1992, Baird 1995). At least in Lao PDR, their market value means that, compared with muntjacs, a high proportion is sent to towns and traded internationally, and many are sold openly in tourist centres such as Louangphabang (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999). In Taiwan, in the past live males were sought for farming velvet; this was far more valuable than the meat. Presently, velvet can be bought legally and cheaply from farms and hunting for velvet is now insignificant, as is, here, hunting for internal organs (Chang Shih-Wei pers. comm. 2008). Hunting pressures and patterns vary across Sambar’s range: three areas (Indochina; Malaysian Borneo; Taiwan) are profiled below, and all are very different not just from each other, but from southern and central India, where (excepting Taiwan) the species has by far the healthiest conservation status. But even across India, hunting for Sambar meat is almost ubiquitous, even occurring within well-secured protected areas, and to greater extents in other protected areas and outside the protected area system (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>Viet Nam, Lao PDR and to a lesser extent Cambodia and northern Thailand are apparently the areas of Sambar’s range where generalised mammal hunting is heaviest. Sambar is hunted within a thriving hunting and wildlife trading culture in this area and in adjacent countries such as China and Thailand, involving many land vertebrate species, along with other forest products such as orchids and Aquilaria resin (e.g. Compton and Le Hai Quang 1998, Compton <em>et al</em>. 1999, Noreen and Claridge 2001, Smith and Xie Yan in press). Such hunting reaches all areas, although in large rugged mountain forest blocks trade-driven hunting of species valued only for their meat (rather than high-value, low-weight, generally medicinal products that can be carried out efficiently from even the remotest areas) is still limited by economics of accessibility. However, the ability of these areas to protect Sambar at the regional scale is questionable, because no areas of rugged evergreen forest are known with high Sambar densities: such habitat is rather marginal. The regional wild meat trade has little likelihood of abating as long as there are any of the most resilient species (pigs, muntjacs, and civets) to be hunted. The human population of Viet Nam is more than 84 million, that of China more than 1,000 million. Together, they comprise an enormous market for wildlife products. For example, tens of millions of wild turtles are imported, legally and illegally, into China annually (van Dijk <em>et al</em>. 2000 and papers therein). There has been no comparable study of ungulate trade levels. Within the Northern and Central Annamites, every square kilometre of Viet Namese forest and of Lao forest that is within 5 km of the Viet Namese border probably has snares capable of capturing Sambar set in it every year (Timmins <em>et al</em>. 2007; R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Intensity in some areas probably reaches many thousands of snare-nights per km<sup>2</sup> per year (Timmins <em>et al</em>. 2007). Snaring is less intensive in Lao PDR at least away from the Vietnamese border, but is increasing dramatically (Timmins and Robichaud 2005; W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. 2007; R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, 2014). Hunting intensity has in recent decades been generally lower in southern Viet Nam than in Lao PDR and northern Viet Nam, leaving many wildlife populations less depleted (e.g. Le Xuan Canh <em>et al</em>. 1997, Timmins and Duckworth 2000, Polet and Ling 2004 ), but the general increase in regional hunting intensity and economic wealth indicate that hunting intensity in this region must also be increasing,&#160;as suggested by a recent survey of forest in Dak Nong Province which detected Sambar only once and found many indications of extremely high hunting pressure (Timmins in press).&#160;Rapid economic development and expanding wealth, particularly Southeast Asia and China, are increasing the demand for wildlife meat and ‘medicines’ (e.g. TRAFFIC&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008). Timmins <em>et al</em>. (2007) highlighted a common misconception, especially in documentation of development projects in the region, that poverty is a principal cause of biodiversity loss: as they pointed out for Saola <em>Pseudoryx nghetinhensis</em>, the main driver of threats to wild ungulates in Indochina, at least for the mid-term, is not rural poverty but increasing urban wealth in Indochina and China. In Viet Nam “the free market economy has resulted in feverish periods of trade in wild species nationwide, with negative impacts on biodiversity” (Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam 2004). In Cambodia, the same factor has fostered a thriving bushmeat market and hunting of species for international wildlife trade (Timmins and Ou 2001, Timmins 2006, Maxwell <em>et al</em>. 2007), and the intensity of hunting there for some species (Sambar included) is likely to exceed even that in Viet Nam. This reflects the logistical ease of hunting and trading with few controls and the relative abundance of high-value quarry species (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). There is a rapid, ongoing, expansion of wealthy social strata in Lao PDR, Cambodia, and Viet Nam, directly accelerated by illegal trade in timber, wild meat, and other forest resources, and by the economics of large infrastructure projects (e.g. Nan Theun 2 hydro-electric power project), creating a significantly greater in-country demand for luxury meats such as venison (W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. 2007). Markets along major roads such as route 13 through Lao PDR (e.g. at Ban Namthon) have expanded, not contracted, in the last 15 years (up to 2008) and have a huge (albeit unquantified) turnover of wild meat; at this specific market, multiple stalls are selling dried deer meat daily. The effects of hunting in Lao PDR, Viet Nam, Cambodia and Thailand have been exacerbated during the last two decades by habitat loss and various socio-economic factors, of which the most biologically significant are discussed in the Red List account for Large-antlered Muntjac <em>M. vuquangensis</em> (<span lang=""EN-US"">Timmins <em>et al</em>. 2008). The most significant constraint to Indochina’s Sambar populations is the long-term uncertainty of success in protected areas, even in those currently effective in conservation management. Even the most successful protected areas face an uncertain future with the possibility of degazettement of conservation status of parts of them, the lack of, or possible future loss of, adequate external funding necessary to maintain high standards of management, the lack of, or possible future loss of, political support necessary to uphold high protection standards and the uncertainties of maintaining a motivated and well-trained staff.<br/><br/>On Borneo, Sambar is also widely and heavily hunted, largely for meat consumed in-country (Bennett <em>et al</em>. 2000, Mohd Azlan J. pers. comm. 2008, Belden Giman pers. comm. 2008, G.M. Fredriksson pers. comm. 2008, A.C. Sebastian pers. comm. 2008, Siew Te Wong pers. comm. 2008). Traditionally, hunters used traps, dogs and spears, and blowpipes. Hunters in remote parts of the interior still use these methods, but most animals now die by gunfire. Sarawak held 60,000 legally registered shotguns while Sabah held almost 13,000 in the mid 1990s (Bennett <em>et al</em>. 2000). Methods used in Indonesia include guns and spotlights along logging roads, snaring, and dogs (G.M. Fredriksson pers. comm. 2008, S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008). Snaring is still very heavy outside well-secured areas, but shotguns remain the even bigger problem (Bennett <em>et al</em>. 2000, Mohd Azlan J. pers. comm. 2008, A.C. Sebastian pers. comm. 2008, Siew Te Wong pers. comm. 2008). Over most of (at least) Malaysian Borneo, “in general, everyone will hunt and eat anything” (Bennett <em>et al</em>. 2000). Much hunting is for the market rather than local use, so there is a limitless demand. Bennett <em>et al</em>. (2000) and Bennett and Gumal (2001) profiled the hunting of ungulates in Sarawak in the mid 1990s thus: Sambar (along with Bearded Hog <em>Sus barbatus</em> and muntjacs <em>Muntiacus</em>) is heavily shot for wild meat trade across Sarawak, and these ungulates are the species most sought by the restaurants; Sambar in particular is an important source of meat for logging company employees in Sarawak. Wild meat is widely sold in towns, villages, restaurants and logging camps throughout Sarawak; 250 sales outlets were estimated across the state in 1996, with an annual trade worth 3.75 million USD. Along the Rejang river alone, in the mid 1980s, 1,500 Sambars were sold per year (Caldecott 1988). The market for meat is great and probably expanding. Bennett <em>et al</em>. (2000) considered the effects of this onslaught upon Sambar through a lengthy hunting study in February 1993 to June 1995, in both Bornean states of Malaysia (Sarawak and Sabah), each with eight study areas. Sambar constituted only 6.7% of animals killed in Sabah, but 35% by weight of wild meat; negligible numbers were taken in Sarawak, reflecting the major declines that had already reduced the species to rarity. Index counts of signs show an inverse relationship between sign index and hunting pressure so strong that the latter over-rode the effects of habitat variables in determining their densities. Hunting was so ubiquitous, even in protected areas, that in the two states, only one site (part of Danum Valley, Sabah) could be found as a control, where there was primary forest but negligible hunting levels. They concluded that “the only single factor offering any effective protection for [quarry species of] wildlife is difficulty of access”; whether animals are protected or non-protected species, inside or outside protected areas, had no significant restraint on hunting levels. There were, then, no official controls on commercial hunting of non-protected species. The Master Plan for Wildlife in Sarawak (Wildlife Conservation Society and Sarawak Forest Department 1996) introduced a strict ban on all wildlife trade, shotgun ownership and cartridge sales in the late 1990s (Bennett and Gumal 2001).&#160;Substantial numbers of Sambars are, nevertheless, still killed in the state, as they are elsewhere in Borneo. Although locally selective logging has probably benefited Sambar populations in some areas by creating more favourable habitats (e.g. Brodie in press b, c), and potentially increasing carrying capacity, the indirect effects of logging undoubtedly greately outweighs any potential benefit (Bennett and Gumal 2001). Moreover, in the interim since the Master Plan, much forest has been completely lost and Sambar populations in the smaller and more isolated areas that remain must now be even more vulnerable to local extinctions. For most Sambar populations inaccessibility is still essentially the only real protection for the species, and there are few inaccessible areas left (J. Brodie in litt 2014).<br/><br/><p> </p>  <p>In a study area of almost half a million hectares in Sarawak Sambar detection probability declined by almost 40% between 2008-2014 (B. Giman pers. comm. 2014). This apparent decline coincided in part with harvesting of <em>Acacia mangium</em> although as of 2014 harvesting activity had only affected a few plantation compartments.&#160;The decline was also attributed to uncontrolled illegal hunting; prior to harvesting few people were involved in plantation activity, but for the period 2012-2014 many workers were brought in, and this resulted in many people hunting on a nightly basis. Additionally the harvesting activity destroyed an important mineral lick (B. Giman pers. comm. 2014).</p><p><br/></p><p>Taiwan contrasts with the rest of Sambar range in that hunting has been so successfully reduced that populations are now increasing in large parts of the island. It was formerly a big problem, for venison and, for medicinal purposes, velvet and penis. The reduction during and since the 1990s reflects five factors. Hunting of Sambar was banned in 1989 through the Wildlife Conservation Act. Velvet prices fell steeply during 1985–1990 with deer TB in 1985, reducing returns from poaching absolutely an effect exacerbated by rapid economic development in 1980s leading to higher daily wages. Former logging road systems are deteriorating within protected areas, making removal of deer meat less attractive. The general awareness of ecological conservation has much enhanced. And eco-tourism through community forestry plans has given alternative employment to former hunters (all information: Lin, C.-Y. and Lee, L.-L. pers. comm. 2008).<br/> <br/> Other sympatric ungulates are hunted broadly as avidly as Sambar, but there is suggestive evidence from two areas of Thailand (Kuiburi National Park and a 20 km² sector of Thung Yai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuary) that when Sambar densities are very much reduced, recovery may be more difficult than with Gaur <em>Bos gaurus</em> and muntjacs. In both these areas the institution of effective protection fuelled a rise in sign density, and presumably animal populations, for Gaur and muntjacs, but not for Sambar (Steinmetz <em>et al</em>. 2007, R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2008). A similar scenario may be ongoing in eastern Cambodia, where Sambar numbers are extremely low (Nuttall <em>et al. </em>2014; O’Kelly <em>et al.</em> 2012; Gray <em>et al.</em> 2013, 2011), presumably because of targeted hunting; yet despite the instigation of protection measures which up to at least 2008 appeared to have moderated hunting pressure there has been no visible sign of recovery (Nuttall <em>et al.</em> 2014). But currently significant levels of hunting still exist and have probably been increasing recently, due both to changes in the dynamics of poaching and to some extent protected area management (Nuttall <em>et al. </em>2014, S. Brook pers. comm. 2014, T. Gray pers. comm. 2014, T. Lynam pers. comm. 2014), and perhaps this could be a significant factor in recovery (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). &#160;If these finding are widely applicable the implications for Sambar populations in Lao PDR, Viet Nam, northern Thailand, Peninsula Malaysia, Sarawak and other areas where populations are mostly down to scattered tiny numbers, may be profound.</p><p><br/></p> Over many centuries, the loss of wilderness to human settlement, cultivation and industry has resulted in massive loss of potential Sambar range, particularly in the densely-settled countries of India, China, Bangladesh, Thailand, and Viet Nam. Throughout the range of Sambar, natural and semi-natural habitats (forest, shrubland and grassland) continue to be converted to anthropogenic habitats, degraded (e.g. stands are being changed in character through logging) and fragmented (broken into smaller blocks). The relative proportions of these activities vary across the range as does the percentage of former forest land so affected. The role of these habitat changes as a direct stimulant of the major declines in progress is unclear. Sambar is highly tolerant of forest degradation: indeed, much higher numbers are found in encroached stands than in pristine closed-canopy forests, if hunting is under control (Rijksen 1978; Heydon 1994; Stuebing 1995; Davies <em>et al</em>. 2001, Brodie <em>et al. </em>in press b, c). Degradation <em>per se</em> is unlikely to be a significant threat. Many Indian forest areas are severely encroached by exotics such as <em>Lantana camara</em>, <em>Parthenium</em> spp. and <em>Chromolaena odorata</em>, and these are suspected to effect major changes to forest structure (Hiremath and Sundaram 2005): but their effects on Sambar populations warrant further study. There is no evidence that Sambar can survive complete conversion of landscapes to non-forest uses such as rice paddies, and its ability to use tree plantations in the absence of natural forest is unclear. Probably, like most deer, provided strips of semi-natural vegetation survive (e.g. along streams and on steep slopes) are present, it can use them to some degree. In most of its range (parts of India excepted) it is unlikely that habitat extent is the determining factor of current Sambar numbers, because large tracts of apparently suitable habitat now support no or only tiny numbers of Sambar. By far the most serious effect of current habitat trends is that fragmentation opens up wilderness areas to people, making it easier to hunt throughout them and cheaper to remove bulk wildlife products such as Sambar meat. In both Malaysian Borneo and Lao PDR the ‘natural protection’ afforded to an area through difficulty of access has been considered to be the chief factor allowing populations of large, hunted, mammals to survive (Timmins and Duckworth 1999, Bennett <em>et al</em>. 2000), and this is probably widely true for Sambar outside India, Nepal and the few other areas where active protective measures are effective. Although Sambar has a wide tolerance of habitat types, numerous observations and studies have indicated that highest densities and presumably habitat preferences of the species correlate with factors such as relatively gentle terrain, river plains, stream and other wetland vicinities, habitat ecotones, and secondary formations originating from closed canopy forests (Simcharoen <em>et al.</em> 2014; Lynam<em> et al.</em> 2012, Brodie<em> et al.</em> in press b, c), all factors which correlate positively with ongoing anthropogenic pressures and thus suggest that optimal habitats (and thus potentially a significant proportion of the global Sambar population) are correlated in one way or another with high threat levels for the species. &#160;In sum, the proximate cause of the major ongoing Sambar declines in most of its range is hunting, for which habitat conversion and fragmentation exacerbate the effects; and these processes are resulting in an ever-smaller maximum possible population, were the hunting issues to be successfully addressed.<br/> <br/> Threats other than hunting and, locally, habitat loss, seem to be insignificant at the species level. Hybridization with Javan Rusa <em>Rusa timorensis</em> has been documented (Van Mourik and Schurig 1985), and is apparently a localized threat, where the latter has been introduced into Sambar range, in Pewajam District, East Kalimantan (G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2006) and potentially more widely (Corlett 2010). Hybridization has also been suspected in Sumatra, with the introduced Chital <em>Axis axis</em> (G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2006). However, Sambar and Chital co-occur extensively in India without hybridizing. Sambar is an occasional crop pest in mainland China, notably around the Ailoshan range (J. Fellowes pers. comm. 2008), India (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008), Lao PDR (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999), Myanmar (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008), Sumatra (D. Martyr pers. comm. 2008), and probably throughout its range. There is no evidence that Sambar is a serious crop pest away from the fields directly abutting forests. Nonetheless, crop damage is often stated by affected farmers to lead to a requirement for lethal control. However, the ready market for meat means that this is most probably an excuse for killing that would enthusiastically be undertaken anyway (N.S. Kumar and J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008): it is therefore unlikely that control of crop-degrading animals is a significant cause of the species' decline anywhere in Sambar’s range. Grazing competition with domestic stock seems to be much less of a threat to Sambar than to sympatric Gaur and Chital: in fact the key study quantifying just how serious a threat such competition is in Indian protected areas (Madhusudan 2004) found that it had negligible effects on Sambar densities, presumably because Sambar is an efficient browser. Threats to southern India’s forest ungulates by competition with domestic stock grazing within protected areas are exacerbated where dung is collected for export to adjacent coffee areas. Fuel wood removal may also be at levels sufficient to disrupt nutrient cycles of the habitat (Madhusudan 2005). In the Indian Terai Arc Landscape, lopping of tree branches for cattle fodder is a threat to Sambar as it effectively removes most browsable vegetation from the landscape (B. Long pers. comm. 2008). These are probably more serious concerns for Sambar than is grazing by domestic stock.</span>","<p><span lang=""EN-US"">Almost everywhere outside Taiwan and <span lang=""EN-GB"">well-managed protected areas<span lang=""EN-GB""> <span lang=""EN-US"">in India, the Sambar is in rapid decline, which has lead to very low numbers and many local-level extinctions over a wide area. The occasional healthy populations reflecting special circumstances. Few surveys specifically target Sambar, but a reasonable picture of its current status is emerging through surveys for Tiger <em>Panthera tigris </em>and through general wildlife surveys. Tiger-oriented camera-trapping predictably yields photographs of Sambar when it is present, and most Tiger surveys afford priority to elucidating Sambar status as a key prey, and therefore population determinant, of Tiger. Understanding Sambar status through surveys of Tigers or, sometimes, of Leopard <em>P. pardus </em>(e.g. Ngoprasert <em>et al.</em> 2007) needs care, because such surveys have generally selected the best remaining areas for very large mammals within the country or region in question, so as to maximize chances of picking up Tigers. They therefore cannot be seen as indicative of Sambar status in the wider landscape. Most importantly, in the several cases (identified below) where such surveys have found few Sambar, these indicate cause for alarm, because there is little reason to believe that there ought to be larger populations in many other areas in the country or region in question, even though large parts of it may remain unsurveyed. Occasional herds can survive in unexpected places through atypical site-specific circumstances in some countries (e.g. Tungittiplakorn and Dearden 2002). Populations outside the native range are not treated here, as they are irrelevant to assigning the Red List Category and Criteria.</span></span></p><p><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US""><br/></span></span></p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">In Sri Lanka, numbers have probably declined substantially through poaching which increased during the civil war. Poaching occurred widely across the country, including within protected areas, particularly where there are concentrations of resettled refugees (Santiapillai and Wijeyamohan 2003).<br/> <br/> In India, although the Sambar occurs widely and in many habitat types, and large populations occur in well-secured protected areas, nowhere is it now regionally abundant (Sankar and Acharya 2004); although see below. It has been recorded in 208 protected areas (National Wildlife Database, Wildlife Institute of India, cited in Sankar and Acharya 2004); its distribution outside protected areas is now generally highly scattered. <span lang=""EN-GB"">Sambar status is best in the three southern Indian states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala (N.&#160;Prakash pers. comm. 2014)<span lang=""EN-GB"">. Most protected areas (tiger reserves, national parks, wildlife sanctuaries) in these states appear to have stable or even increasing Sambar local populations and they are easily one of the most common ungulates encountered in protected areas (N. Prakash pers. comm. 2014)<span lang=""EN-GB"">. Protected areas in Karnataka in particular have high densities of Sambar&#160; (N. Prakash pers. comm. 2014)<span lang=""EN-GB"">. Hunting and poaching has been more problematic in areas of Kerala, but it also has some very well protected areas and there is also constant in-migration from protected areas outside of Kerala, this is especially so in the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve area (N. Prakash pers. comm. 2014)<span lang=""EN-GB"">. The situation outside&#160;protected areas&#160;in the three southern states is however often very different and “mostly in the red”, but there are a few exceptions, like the Valparai Plateau in Tamil Nadu where Sambar is very common, and can be found on private lands (Sridhar <em>et al. </em>2008, N. Prakash pers. comm. 2014)<span lang=""EN-GB"">. In the southern Western Ghats in particular and some parts to the north of this, there has been no noticeable decline in Sambar distribution in the last twenty years (D. Mudappa pers. comm. 2014). However there are indications, based on interview data that abundance has been declining in the Western Ghats (Pillay<em> et al.</em> 2011). <br/></span></span></span></p><p><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><br/></span></span></span></span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-GB"">In other central and east Indian states Sambar is “very rare”, “extremely patchy and in severe decline” “owing to severe hunting pressures, insurgency, rapidly spreading mines (both bauxite and iron-ore)” (N.&#160;Prakash pers. comm. 2014)<span lang=""EN-GB"">. <br/></span></p><p><span lang=""EN-GB""><br/></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">The reported ecological densities of Sambar in India mostly fall within 1–10 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;within the protected area network, and depending on the varying levels of protection efficacy: Bhadra Tiger Reserve, 0.89 +/- 0.23 (SE) per km<sup>2</sup> (Jathanna <em>et al.</em> 2003); Madhya Pradesh Pench National Park dry deciduous forest, 9.6 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Nichols 2000); Kanha moist deciduous forest, 1.5 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Nichols 2000); Nagarahole moist deciduous forest, 5.5 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Sunquist 1992); Bandipur dry deciduous forest, 5.6 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Nichols 2000); Tadoba-Andhari dry deciduous forest, 3.3 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Kumar 2005); Melghat dry deciduous forest, 2.7 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Kumar 2005); Maharashtra Pench dry deciduous forest, 5.9 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Kumar 2005); Ranthambore semi-arid dry deciduous forest, 10.7 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Kumar 2000); and Gir semi-arid dry deciduous forest, two animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Khan et al. 1996). Similar surveys at Kaziranga found too few Sambar to estimate populations there (Karanth and Nichols 2000), this presumably representing habitat characters rather than defective protection, given the buoyant populations of other deer at that site (Hog Deer <em>Axis porcinus</em> and Barasingha <em>Rucervus duvaucelii</em>). The recorded Bhadra density is low, reflecting poaching and forest-resource extraction (Jathanna <em>et al. </em>2003), and the population density is steadily increasing following removal of these pressures in 2003 (K.U. Karanth and N.S. Kumar unpublished data as of 2008).<span lang=""EN-GB""> Local population trends in well protected reserves appear to be stable and even increasing in areas recently freed from anthropogenic pressures (D. Jathanna pers. comm. 2014)<span lang=""EN-GB"">. But in poorly protected reserved forests subject to hunting and heavy cattle grazing, Sambar density seems to be extremely low; certainly too low to permit actual estimation of density (D. Jathanna pers. comm. 2014)<span lang=""EN-GB"">. <span lang=""EN-US"">Outside protected areas, Sambar is present mostly in very low numbers, although larger numbers can still be found where its habitat is almost inaccessible to people (Anonymous 2008).<br/> <br/> Nepal supports an important population in Bardia National Park (Dinerstein 1979). This remains healthy and there are also good populations in Parsa Wildlife Reserve, Chitwan National Park, and Sukla Phanta Wildlife Reserve. Across the country Sambar has declined so rapidly and so widely that it is now very rare outside protected areas, mostly recorded as isolated reports from forests adjoining these protected areas, and from south-east Nepal. Sambar has been victim of poachers, probably because of its large size (thus, more meat per animal and, for males, a more impressive trophy), perhaps compounded by nocturnal and relatively docile nature; recent declines are of the magnitude to meet IUCN criteria for Vulnerable on a national assessment (all information: Hem Sagar Baral pers. comm. 2008). It is unclear whether the demand for antler in velvet in eastern Asia is stimulating poaching in Nepal.<br/> <br/> No information concerning current status was traced from Bhutan but (simply on an area basis) numbers are unlikely to be large enough to influence the overall global population trend.<br/> <br/> In Bangladesh, the Sambar was common in the north-east, south-east and hill-tract forests in the 1960s (Khan 1985) but now is restricted to the forest fragments of the southeast, mainly in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) (Suprio Chakma pers. comm. 2014). Sambar occurrence in protected areas (national parks, wildlife sanctuaries and eco parks) is now doubtful and all recent records and reports have come from outside protected areas from areas that were largely inaccessible to the majority of people prior to 1997 due to insurgency (S. Chakma pers. comm. 2014). Sambar was detected by camera-trapping at 22 of 38 surveyed grid cells (each &gt;50% forest cover&#160; and 10,000 ha) in the CHT during 2010-2011, but it was assumed that outside the survey area, Sambar was either absent or occurred in very low numbers (Suprio Chakma pers. comm. 2014). Within the best two grid cells (rated in terms of forest cover, inaccessibility and presence of Dhole <em>Cuon alpinus</em>) detection rate of Sambar was 2.07 independent photos/100 camera trap nights. Following the signing of a peace accord between the Bangladesh Government and the Parbatya Chattagram Jana Sanghati Samity (the political organization of CHT indigenous people) both the rate of habitat loss and hunting pressure have been accelerating in the period after 1997 (S. Chakma pers. comm. 2014). There is no sign of significant change in either factor in near future and if current habitat loss and hunting rates continue indefinitely extirpation of sambar is likely within the next 30 years (S. Chakma pers. comm. 2014). <br/></span></span></span></p><p><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US""><br/></span></span></p><p><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US""> In China there were major declines in Sambar over much of the twentieth century, and populations probably decreased by more than 50% in the 30 years from 1978 to 2008; records from Guangxi suggest that, there at least, the 1970s–1980s was the era of fastest decline (J. Fellowes pers. comm. 2008; B.P.L. Chan pers. comm. 2008). In some provinces populations seem now to have stabilized, and in some areas, particularly in Hainan (where several apparently stabilised populations are present, but all are small, reflecting habitat patch size: the largest may be of only a few hundred animals) and north Guangdong province (perhaps also the east of that province, where there is a nature reserve specifically for the species), populations may even have been increasing once again in the last few years. This is not so for Guizhou, Guangxi, Guangdong and Yunnan (B.P.L. Chan and M.W.N. Lau pers. comm. 2008). Further north, in the provinces of Fujian, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Hunan and Hubei, a multi-method Tiger survey in 2001 found that Sambar is very rare overall and scattered in present-day distribution (Tilson <em>et al.</em> 2004). For elsewhere in China, Smith and Xie Yan (2008) mapped wide presence in Sichuan, plus isolated populations in the provinces of Qinghai, Tibet, Chongqing, and Fujian. The original sources are not clear, and R. Harris (pers. comm.) doubts that Sambar has lived anywhere in Qinghai in recent times. <br/> <br/> In Taiwan, numbers and geographic distribution reduced rapidly through hunting before 1987, then expanded somewhat since the mid 1990s reflecting reductions in hunting. The average population density in the Yu-Li Wildlife Refuge was 10.6 animals per km² in 2005. In some areas at high altitude, densities exceed 40 animals per km², and the animals have a large impact on the coniferous saplings in this area. But at low to mid altitude, hunting pressure remains high enough to restrain their distribution and density. Based on the known geographical distribution, there are five populations: A-Yu Mountain, Nanhu, Shei-Pa, Jade Mountains–Central Mountains, and Tawu. The A-Yu population was re-introduced (about 70 animals) by local deer farmers in 1988–1991, when the velvet price was very low through the impact of deer TB in 1985. This population has not expanded reflecting continuous poaching; it may be genetically polluted. The other four populations are all natural, assumed to be isolated by cross-island roads, and may have very low gene flows with each other. Sambar is largely restricted to protected areas, only occurring outside them in a few nearby areas. The population sizes and distributions in these areas are smaller than in the protected areas. The poaching pressure is an important limitation to Sambar in these unprotected areas (all information: Lin, C.-Y. and Lee, L.-L. pers. comm. 2008).<br/> <br/> In Myanmar, Sambar was detected at 12 of 15 camera-trapped Tiger sites during 1999–2002, indicating that it was still widespread (Lynam 2003). Sambar meat and antlers were commonly found in local markets in the Hukaung Valley in 2002 (A. Lynam pers. comm. 2014) indicating heavy hunting pressure, possibly partially explaining extremely low densities of tigers in the area at that time (Lynam <em>et al.</em> 2009).&#160; The Myanmar Forest Department and Wildlife Conservation Society have since jointly (as of May 2008) camera-trapped 21 survey areas (including the earlier 15) and found Sambar in 13 (S. Htun pers. comm. 2008). This lower ratio of proven presence indicates how the areas selected for Tiger survey were above average for prey and may indicate increasing local-level extinctions. For example, in a multi-method study of one area not expected to hold Tiger, hunted animals showed that Sambar still occurred in Naungmung and Machanbaw (south of Hkakaborazi National Park, Kachin state), but it was so scarce that it was not detected by substantial amounts of either camera trapping or sign surveys (Rao <em>et al.</em> 2005). Even within these best areas, large declines are suspected and overall national population losses of about 50% over the last 25–30 years and in the following such period are likely (Than Zaw pers. comm. 2006; Saw Htun pers. comm. 2008).<br/> <br/> In Thailand, several protected areas maintain big Sambar populations; these are mostly large with very few or no people living within them. Over much of the country Sambar is extinct or very nearly so, including in many protected areas, particularly in the north where most parks are small and heavily poached (Anak Patannavibool pers. comm. 2008). Sambar is rare in most areas of Thung Yai Naresuan, where commercial hunting has targeted large ungulates (Steinmetz <em>et al. </em>2008). Sambar was recorded at over 40% of camera-trap locations during a Leopard survey in Kaeng Krachan National Park, and clearly remains widespread there. Abundance did not vary with proximity to villages, even though a variety of hunting methods occurs on site (Ngoprasert et al. 2007). Sambar is also locally abundant in Khao Yai National Park, Thap Lan National Park and Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary (Lynam et al. 2006), and the remote core zone of Khlong Saeng Wildlife Sanctuary (A. Lynam pers. comm. 2014). In Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary current Sambar density is about 2–3 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;and it seems to be increasing (Anak Patannavibool pers. comm. 2008).<br/> <br/> In Lao PDR, Sambar was described as very common throughout the wooded parts by Delacour (1940). Some decades later, the species was reported during 86% of 1988–1993 village interviews (n = 328) and was then still widespread throughout, except in the most heavily settled areas (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1999: Annex 5). However, sightings on surveys during 1992–1998 were very rare, and while calls heard by night and signs indicate a wide distribution, numbers are heavily depressed (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Timmins and Ou 2001). Only in Nam Et–Phou Louey NPA did Sambar seem at least locally abundant (Davidson 1998), and reasonable populations were confirmed still to persist in 2003–2004 (Johnson <em>et al.</em> 2004); an exceptional area in an Indochinese context, that still supported significant Tiger numbers in 2008 (Walston <em>et al. </em>2010). The Nakai Plateau and the mountainous interior of Nakai-Nam Theun NPA and a few other, localized, areas of Lao PDR, including the Dong Kalo tract of Xe Pian NPA, the Nam Hiang area of the Bolaven Plateau, and parts of Nam Kading NPA also seemed to support relatively high densities during the mid 1990s. The few sites resurveyed during 2004–2007 have in general shown major declines (e.g. Timmins and Robichaud 2005). There was not a single camera-trap photograph during fairly intensive camera-trapping in Nakai–Nam Theun NPA during 2006–2007, although the species has subsequently been found to persist in a few parts of the protected area (Johnson and Johnston 2007; W.G. Robichaud and Nam Theun Watershed Management Protection Authority pers. comm. 2008) and it is not clear whether quirks of camera-trap placement (e.g., hypothetically, a focus on slopes rather than valley bottoms) may have been a major contributor to the lack of photographs. The Nakai Plateau still supports noteworthy numbers in a Lao context, but even here there were signs of decline (Dersu 2007; R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, 2014) and no Sambar were camera-trapped in Xe Sap NPA during relatively extensive camera-trapping (~40 sites, ~5,000 trap-nights) in 2012 and 2013 (WWF Greater Mekong unpubl. 2014). Surprisingly, given the proximity to China and Viet Nam, a good population was found to persist in Phou Dendin NPA in the far north-east of Lao PDR in 2004–2005 (W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. 2008). In sites surveyed since 2008 evidence for persistence has been found in most large forest blocks (e.g. &gt;50,000 ha), although nowhere common, but generally not in small and isolated fragments, while in many areas of the country evidence suggests increasing levels of hunting especially commercial scale snaring (SUFORD 2010, Duckworth in press, Duckworth et al. 2010, Timmins 2014, 2009, in press b, Woxvold 2009, Timmins and Duckworth 2012, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014).<br/> <br/> In Viet Nam, in most of the northern highlands, in particular, and all other areas of Viet Nam to an increasing extent, Sambar is very rare or has been hunted out from many areas of otherwise suitable habitat (Timmins <em>et al</em>. 1999; Grieser Johns 2000; Timmins and Trinh Viet Cuong 2001; R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, 2014; B. Long pers. comm. 2008). Camera-trapping studies in Pu Mat National Park, Thua Thien Hue province and Quang Nam province between 1998 and 2007 recorded only a handful of records and local communities in all these areas report a major decline in numbers (B. Long pers. comm. 2008). Greater than 19,000 camera-trap nights from &gt;100 locations in the Hue and Quang Nam Saola Nature Reserves detected the species from only one location (WWF Greater Mekong unpubl. 2014). With so many higher-profile species long listed as threatened on the Red List, many of them with restricted ranges, the status of Sambar in Viet Nam has largely been ignored, and the paucity of evidence during many surveys has rarely been highlighted in reviews. As with many large mammals, populations were thought to be best in southern parts of the country, but even here hunting pressure is high in most remaining forest areas, and Sambar is thought to be scarce to extirpated in most remaining forest areas (a high proportion of which is within protected areas) (Timmins in press a, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). It was not considered at all common in surveys of several areas of prime habitat in Dak Lak Province in 1997 (Le Xuan Canh <em>et al.</em> 1997). In a three week survey of forest in western Dak Nong Province only a single Sambar was detected on the basis of signs, this despite the area being contiguous with Seima PF in Cambodia (Timmins in press a). It remains locally common in Cat Tien National Park (Polet and Ling 2004, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014), but this is very much the exception to the species status in almost all protected areas in Viet Nam (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014).<br/> <br/> In Cambodia, Sambar “appears to be at least relatively common in some areas, though entirely absent from others, a feature which appears to have a strong correlation to local hunting pressure. At the current rate of persecution, this species is likely to decline sharply over the next few years (Walston <em>et al.</em> 2001). During the 2008 assessment Sambar was considered “still widespread, although heavily targeted by hunters and most populations are now very depressed (Timmins and Men 1999, Timmins <em>et al. </em>2003, Tordoff <em>et al.</em> 2005, Timmins 2006)”. However substantial declines have certainly occurred since that time (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014), as a result of increasing hunting pressure, especially in the east because of Vietnamese driven trade (Nuttall <em>et al.</em> 2014, Timmins in press a), but elsewhere because of increasing ease of access to forest areas as a result of infrastructure development, settlement of frontier forest areas and agriculture and forestry concession developments (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). <span lang=""EN-GB"">In Seima PF, Phnom Prich WS, and Mondulkiri PF Sambar densities are considered too low to allow density and population estimation, although behaviour is also thought to contribute to the low detection rate on line transects there (Nuttall <em>et al.</em> 2014; T. Gray pers. comm. 2014). The population is almost certainly smaller even than that of wild oxen, and probably numbers in the low hundreds of animals (Nuttall <em>et al.</em> 2014). Sambar densities are low throughout the Eastern Plains (e.g. Gray <em>et al.</em> 2013, 2011; Timmins and Ou Ratanak 2001), almost certainly a result of targeted hunting in combination with the ecological association of Sambar with ‘edge’-type habitats and riparian corridors. <span lang=""EN-US"">In the eastern plains of Cambodia, where populations of many other ungulates were and still are magnitudes more numerous than in other areas of Indochina, Sambar numbers are clearly low, almost certainly as a result of targeted hunting: numbers in some areas seem depressed even well below those of wild cattle (Nuttall <em>et al.</em> 2014;&#160;<span lang=""EN-GB"">Gray <em>et al. </em>2013, 2011;&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">Timmins and Ou 2001). Protection activities in a few localised areas appeared initially to have stabilized declines up to c. 2008, but this was an exception to a general scenario of rapid decline, and now it appears that even in these reasonably well managed areas with significant resources input into protection and law enforcement activities that hunting pressure is rising in intensity, presumably largely because of the increasing lucrative nature of the trade in wildlife, rather than a decrease in protection efforts, augmented somewhat by the greater connectivity and better infrastructure connecting wildlife sources to markets (T. Gray pers. comm. 2014, S. Brook pers. comm. 2014, J. Khamler pers. comm. 2014, T. Lynam pers. comm. 2014). These declines are evidently faster and more recent than in either Lao PDR or Viet Nam, reflecting the rapid pace of change of economic and logistical factors in Cambodia since the mid 1990s. Since the species' assessment in 2008 this rate of decline has almost certainly increased, perhaps even by an order of magnitude (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). The primary reason for this increase has been the rapid economic growth that Cambodia has seen in the intervening period, particularly the rapid development of agro-industry (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). This by itself would not necessarily lead to major declines in Sambar, but the infrastructural development associated with agricultural concessions has created easy access to huge areas of formerly relatively remote forest areas (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). Even protected areas are not secure, with legal concessions granted within the former boundaries of even those with strong international support (T.D. Evans pers. comm. 2014). At the same time illegal exploitation of the rich natural resources of Cambodia has increased, as commodity values have increased, as access to these resources has increased and as regional cross-border natural resource trade networks have become stronger (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). Recent studies have confirmed what was earlier suspected that Sambar populations even in some of the areas of best wildlife status are highly depressed, but more worryingly however there are no signs of a significant recovery in such areas and hunting pressure may in fact be increasing despite concerted resource investment in protected area management, particularly law enforcement strategies, from international NGOs (Nuttall <em>et al.</em> 2014; Gray <em>et al</em>. 2013, 2011; O’Kelly <em>et al.</em> 2012; S. Brook pers. comm. 2014; J. Kamler pers. comm. 2014). Although the rates of decline have been increasing in Cambodia, concurrently as the numbers of animals remaining have decreased, the influence of the Cambodian population status on the global population trend has probably changed little (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014).<br/> <br/> For a review of the species status in Peninsula Malaysia Kawanishi <em>et al.</em> (2014) considered that the rate of decline was sufficient to warrant an Endangered listing, i.e. a 50% or greater decline. This conclusion was based on several lines of evidence, most notably the results of camera-trapping surveys showing absence and or low densities in a majority of remaining forest areas, and rates of forest loss. Camera-trapping studies between 1998 and 2008 over more than 20,000 trap days, detected Sambar (68 photographs) in only 3 of 18 Permanent Reserved Forests, but detected the species in all five protected areas surveyed (346 photographs in c. 19,900 trap-days) (<span lang=""EN-GB"">Kawanishi <em>et al. </em>2013, 2014<span lang=""EN-US"">), however the species was only commonly detected (e.g. capture rate &gt;1/25 trap nights) in two PAs Taman Negara K Koh and Endau Rompin and one PRF Temenggor. Lynam <em>et al.</em> (2007) like the majority of the studies that formed part of the synthesis of <span lang=""EN-GB"">Kawanishi <em>et al. </em>(2013, 2014<span lang=""EN-US"">) was specifically aimed at Tigers and their prey, and hence camera-traps were set specifically with Sambar detection in mind, the results are thus particularly informative of Sambar status; during the study Sambar was photographed at only one of the nine areas surveyed during 1997–1999, Temenggor, where it was the most commonly photographed mammal (Lynam <em>et al</em>. 2007).&#160;In more recent studies from 2009 to 2013 totalling more than 40,000 trap days focused on three national priority tiger conservation landscapes Sambar was detected by camera-trapping in only four of ten forest units surveyed, with presence confirmed in another through observational surveys of signs, but was only commonly detected in one, Royal Belum State Park (<span lang=""EN-GB"">Kawanishi <em>et al.</em> 2014<span lang=""EN-US"">). The high incidence of muntjac and pig pictures in both earlier and later periods of survey clearly indicate that the results are indicative of Sambar status rather than an issue with camera-trapping methodology. &#160;In the 1990s, Sambar was found in only one of 14 sites (seven virgin jungle reserves and seven adjacent logged areas) in a study assessing the importance of virgin jungle reserves, making it the most localized mammal species visually detected on forest transects (Laidlaw 2000, K. <span lang=""EN-GB"">Kawanishi<span lang=""EN-GB""> <span lang=""EN-US"">pers. comm. 2014). The occupied site was a logged area (Laidlaw 2000). None was found in the Jerangau Forest Reserve, from which it was suspected to have been eradicated by hunting (Azlan 2006; one of the 23 studies assessed by <span lang=""EN-GB"">Kawanishi <em>et al.</em> 2014<span lang=""EN-US"">).</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US""><br/> </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">Camera-trapping and sign-based survey studies in Taman Negara NP have independently corroborated declines in Sambar numbers between c. 2000 and 2010 (<span lang=""EN-US"">Kawanishi&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). Crude density estimates based of photographic capture-recapture analysis of individually recognizable stags (Kawanishi and Sunquist 2004) declined from 0.20 to 0.01 animals per km<sup>2</sup> while the occupancy estimate declined from 0.54 to 0.19 in Taman Negara.

Serious recent declines are also corroborated by an interview survey of hunters in which over 80% of 61 interviewees from throughout Peninsula Malaysia considered declines had occurred (<span lang=""EN-GB"">Goldthorpe and Neo 2011<span lang=""EN-US"">), and a decline in the number of hunting licences issued for Sambar (<span lang=""EN-GB"">Kawanishi 2008,&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">Kawanishi&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).

Sambar appears to remain fairly common in three of the eight sites, the Maliau Basin and Danum Valley in Sabah, where protection from hunting is reasonably good and the Hose Mountains of Sarawak which are relatively inaccessible (Brodie et al. in press a, b, <span lang=""EN-US"">J. Brodie in litt. 2014). Sambar was found to be present but uncommon in the remaining areas of Mulu National Park (Sarawak), Pulong Tau National Park (Sarawak), the Ulu Padas region (Sabah), the Ulu Trusan region (Sarawak), and the Ulu Baram (Sarawak) (Brodie <em>et al.</em> in press, <span lang=""EN-US"">J.

Other populations previously reported to be in reasonable condition include those in <span lang=""EN-US"">Tabin Wildlife Reserve (Matsubayashi and Sukor 2005), and Deramakot Forest Reserve (Matsubayashi <em>et al.</em> 2007) both in Sabah. Sambar has been extirpated or persists only at extremely low densities in Lambir Hills National Park, Sarawak, Malaysia (Azlan and Engkamat Lading 2006). An intensive survey of Batang Ai National Park, Sarawak, found Sambar only once; this was stated to be a genuine reflection of actual rarity, and to result from intensive hunting at salt-licks (Meredith 1995). Across Sarawak and to a lesser extent Sabah it is seriously reduced by hunting (Bennett <em>et al.</em> 2000, see Threats; A.C. Sebastian pers. comm. 2008), although persistence is probably still widespread (J. Brodie in litt. 2014). <br/></span></span></span></span></p><p><span lang=""EN-US""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""il""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><br/></span></span></span></span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">In the Indonesian part of Borneo populations seem to be less depleted, particularly in East Kalimantan, which is believed to hold the largest Sambar populations among all Kalimantan provinces; in the Penajam Paser Utara district of East Kalimantan, approximately 60 hunted animals are sold monthly in several traditional markets (Semiadi <em>et al.</em> 2004, G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2008).</p><p><span lang=""EN-US""><br/></span></p><p>In Indonesia, there are various recent records from Sumatra, e.g. Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park (O'Brien<em> </em><em>et al</em>. 2003), Gunung Leuser (van Schaik and Griffiths (1996), and Way Kambas National Park (S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008), but in these areas it was recorded rather rarely by comparison with other ungulates. Sambar was nearly six times as abundant in areas of Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park with low than with high human population density within 10 km of the park boundary, suggesting low resilience to human presence, presumably the effects of hunting, and reduced populations overall (O'Brien&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2003). In Way Kambas National Park the population is reportedly stable (G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2008). Overall in Indonesia (Sumatra and Borneo), Sambar is not under major threat except where forest is being converted (i.e. most of the lowlands). Reflecting this, E. Pollard (pers. comm. 2008) considered the status of Sambar, in suitable habitat, to be much more healthy there than in Cambodia and Viet Nam, although there is a significant market for Sambar antlers in Sumatra (D. Martyr pers. comm. 2008).</p>",Decreasing,"The Sambar extends from India and Sri Lanka east along the southern Himalayas (including Nepal and Bhutan) through much of south China (including Hainan Island) to Taiwan (where it occurs in the central and eastern parts; Lin, C.-Y. and Lee, L.-L. pers. comms. 2008). Further south it occurs in Bangladesh, throughout mainland Southeast Asia (Myanmar, Thailand, Lao PDR, Cambodia, Viet Nam, West Malaysia) and many of the main islands of the Greater Sundas (excepting Java): Sumatra, Siberut, Sipora, Pagi and Nias islands (all Indonesia), and Borneo (Malaysia, Indonesia, and Brunei) (Grubb 2005). The current distribution is now highly fragmented in much of this range (see Population). Payne <em>et al</em>. (1985) also listed the Philippines, but the Sambar does not occur there. A record from Ujung Kulon, Java, in van Schaik and Griffiths (1996: 107) is presumably an error for Javan Deer <em>R. timorensis</em>. The Sambar has been introduced widely outside its native range, e.g.: San Luis Obispo Country, California; the Gulf Prairies and Edwards Plateau regions of Texas (Ables and Ramsey 1974); the St. Vincent Islands, Franklin Country, Florida (Lewis <em>et al</em>. 1990); Australia (Slee 1984, Freeland 1990); New Zealand (Kelton and Skipworth 1987); and Western Cape Province, South Africa (Lever 1985). These introduced populations are not included on the distribution map.","The Sambar is hunted for sport, food, medicinal products and other purposes. It is uncertain how many captive animals are kept within the native range, potentially larger herds occur in countries where introduced, and the comparative contributions of wild and captive sourced products to markets is unknown - the markets may be somewhat separate.",Terrestrial,"The Sambar is found in many protected areas throughout its range, although in most of these areas this legal status has not stemmed declines and local extinctions from hunting. Similarly, although it is protected from hunting by legislation, even outside protected areas, in most or all range states, these laws are challenging to enforce, given the trade demand for meat and antlers (GMA Indonesia Workshop).&#160;In Sarawak, Borneo, unfortunately,&#160;Sambar&#160;is not on the protected list of Sarawak Wildlife Protection Ordinance, 1998 (a,b) (B. Giman pers. comm. 2014).&#160;Currently the law has a strong protective effect in Taiwan (Lin, C.-Y. and Lee, L.-L. pers. comm. 2008) and in various protected areas of India (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>In Southeast Asia, Sambar declines have lagged behind those of other sympatric deer (excepting muntjacs). There is no doubt that within a decade or two Sambar will be, like Hog Deer and Eld’s Deer are already, almost absent from South-east Asia unless effective protection from trade-driven hunting is instituted. In India the species’s status is less grim, and this is dependent upon continuation of the current protected areas system, and the expansion of effective threat reduction into a greater proportion of protected areas: in many Indian protected areas, poaching is rampant and in such vulnerable areas Sambar numbers are still declining. Given the major challenges combating hunting of such a desired animal, long-term survival is most realistic in large protected areas (exceeding 1,000 km<sup>2</sup> where possible), lacking people living within them, with an adequate number of motivated and capable staff (Anak Patannavibool pers. comm. 2008, A.J. Lynam pers. comm. 2008). The precise ways for protected areas to function effectively in the conservation of large mammals depend upon their own specific circumstances, but field presence of staff, dispersed across the area, is likely to be important in almost every area. For example, Lynam <em>et al</em>. (2006) found in Khao Yai National Park, Thailand, that encounter rates of tracks and signs of Sambar (and other large mammals) decreased with distance from ranger substations. Deep inside the forest to the south and east, far away from ranger substations, Sambar was locally extinct. Similar patterns are shown by current Sambar distributions in other Thai protected areas such as Khao Sok, Phu Khieo and Kaeng Krachan (A.J. Lynam pers. comm. 2008). In some protected areas (recent examples being Bhadra and Kudremukh in Karnataka), formerly forest-dwelling human communities have resettled closer to markets, clinics, school and other services (Karanth and Karanth 2007). This expands habitat available to Sambar (that which was formerly fields and houses) but more significant is the removal of a source of hunters and the cessation of grazing competition with domestic stock (see Karanth <em>et al</em>. 2006). Such conservation interventions have helped recovery of Sambar populations in this region. Increasing development aspirations mean that outmigration is likely from further areas, e.g. Mudumalai. Most of the remaining forest within its Chinese range are already established as nature reserves (M.W.N. Lau pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>As the majority of the Sambar population is in South Asia, conservation activities are important there. It is also important that populations are maintained at least in several areas in Southeast Asia, to maintain Sambar presence through its historical range, to preserve Sambar genetic diversity and through its importance to the ecosystems within which it lives. Given the regional pattern of threats and current successes to date, implementing effective conservation interventions is considerably more challenging, and therefore a higher priority in the Southeast Asian region.<br/><br/><p>The most important conservation measure for Sambar in Cambodia is the continued strengthening and support of conservation efforts in Seima Protected Forest, Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary and Mondulkiri Protected Forest and to a lesser extent support of protected area conservation management in the northern plains and central Cardamoms. Likewise in Viet Nam, the most important conservation measure is the continued support of protection efforts within Cat Tien National Park, and in Thailand it is to to expand government-funded park protection and ranger training programmes outside of the few parks which are currently well supported in the Western Forest Complex. In Myanmar the Hukaung Valley is an exceptional area of lowland plains forest, grassland, and wetlands. Through its size and mostly little-encroached condition, this is the most outstanding remaining landscape-level floodplains habitat for very large mammals remaining in tropical Asia, and although wildlife populations are highly depleted, warrants the strongest effort to conserve it. It faces a number of daunting challenges (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). In Lao PDR, any of a large number of areas could become key Sambar conservation sites, but there is as yet no precedent in the country for effective conservation of high-trade-value large mammals. Xe Pian, Nam Et–Phou Louey, and Nakai–Nam Theun NPAs could all be highly significant areas for the species, but so could almost any other NPA; the reality is that the most success with Sambar conservation is likely to come through identifying areas with positive underlying situations to achieve conservation, rather than identifying the area with the most intrinsic importance for Sambar as the focus for efforts.<br/> <br/> Captive breeding is being developed in East Kalimantan (G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2008). A captive herd of 223 heads in 10 ha enclosure was established in 1998 in Penajam District, as a pilot project. Several private herds exist in the province, such as at Bearau and at Nunukan, both with more than 20 heads (G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2008). Captive Sambar herds are also widespread in mainland Asia.&#160;</p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

It is also common in its native range in East Asian countries. Although subject to some possible localized declines, there is no evidence to suggest that the species is at any risk of extinction, and is listed as Least Concern.","Two features are typical of the habitat of Raccoon Dogs: 1) they are often found near water; and 2) during autumn they are more or less dependent on fruits and berries, which affect their habitat selection. In Japan, their habitat includes deciduous forests, broad-leaved evergreen forests, mixed forests, farmlands, and urban areas from coastal to subalpine zones. In the countryside, the species prefers herbaceous habitat and uses less <em>Cryptomeria</em> plantation throughout year, while riparian areas are often used (Kauhala and Saeki 2004b). In urban areas, Raccoon Dogs inhabit areas with as little as 5% forest cover (Yamamoto <em>et al</em>. 1995). In the Russian Far East, the Raccoon Dog favours open landscape, especially damp meadows and agricultural land and avoids dark forests (Judin 1977). <br/><br/>In the introduced range, Raccoon Dogs favour moist meadows and other habitats with abundant undergrowth, mixed forests and shores of rivers and lakes, especially in early summer (Korneev 1954, Nasimovic and Isakov 1985, Kauhala 1996). In late summer and autumn, they favour moist heaths with abundant berries (Morozov 1947, Kauhala 1996). However, in the Finnish archipelago, they live in barren pine forests where they feed on crowberries (<em>Empetrum nigrum</em>) (Kauhala and Auniola 2000).&#160;In Finland, generally the best landscape for Raccoon Dogs is a landscape with abundant undergrowth, a mosaic of moist forests, damp meadows, gardens and agricultural area (Kauhala and Auttila 2010, Kauhala <em>et al</em>. 2010). The population is sparse in large coniferous forests.","Raccoon Dogs are still persecuted across much of their native range as a pest species. They also may be affected locally by predation from feral dogs, road kills, and from epidemics (including scabies and canine distemper virus), and in some cases may be declining due to extreme habitat loss. The Raccoon Dog is an important vector and victim of rabies in Europe, with increasing significance towards the east and north.","Outside of Japan, where the species is common, there is no information on abundance in their native range. Lau <em>et al</em>. (2010) noted that in China they probably still exist in the wild in parts of Guangxi and Guangdong, but are otherwise likely to be threatened. Population estimates have never been&#160;conducted in Japan, but indirect indices (e.g., road-kills per km of the National Express-ways and harvest&#160;density per prefecture), suggest that relative abundance is high in south-western parts of Japan (i.e., Kyushu, Shikoku, and Chugoku) and low in Hokkaido, Chubu, and extremely urban areas (Kauhala and Saeki 2004b; and see&#160;Table 5.4.2 therein). In Viet Nam, the southerly extent of their range, there is very little information available on their status. A survey undertaken in 2004 in five areas in Na Hang District, Tuyen Quang Province, recorded two captive young animals in Na Vang village after apparently having been taken from a small cave (presumably a den) in Lung Nhoi area (Le Trong Trai <em>et al</em>. 2004), but there is otherwise no other recent information.<br/><br/>The species is common in the introduced range; for example, in Finland the adult population consists of 110,000-120,000 individuals (hunting bag 160,000-170,000 individuals each year). The autumn population, including the young of the year would be about 320,000.",Stable,"The native range of this species extends from northern Indochina (ranging as far south as north-eastern Viet Nam, east of the Red River, and southern Yunnan province in China) through the eastern provinces of China and the Korean Peninsula to the south-east corner of Russia and Mongolia. In the Japanese Archipelago, the species is present throughout Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu, Awaji island, Sado island and other islets of Japan except those south of Kyushu (e.g., Okinawa islands, Nansei islands, Miyako islands and Ogasawara islands). Introduced to Yakushima island (S. Azuma, in Kauhala and Saeki 2004b).&#160;Absent from Hainan and Taiwan, Province of China.&#160;<br/><br/>The species was introduced in the early to mid-part of the 20th Century to European parts of the former Soviet Union and since then the species has become widespread in northern and eastern Europe, thriving in a landscape which is a mosaic of moist forests with abundant undergrowth, damp meadows and gardens (Kauhala<em> et al</em>. 2010). The northern limit of distribution lies in areas where the mean temperature of the year is just above 0°C, the snow cover &lt;800 mm, the duration of the snow cover &lt;175 days and the length of the growing season &gt;135 days (for example, in Finland the northern limit of permanent distribution is between 65°N and the Arctic Circle). In recent years, when winters have become milder, the Raccoon Dog has expanded its range northwards (in Finland, up to 67°N). Raccoon Dogs appear to have been expanding their range in recent times, including a record in 2002 from the central part of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (at the time the southernmost point of its European range; Ćirović 2006) and a road-kill in south-eastern Spain in 2008 (Kauhala and&#160;Kowalczyk 2011). The latter authors provide a detailed review of the history of colonization of the Raccoon Dog in Europe.","The Russians introduced Raccoon Dogs into the wild in the European part of the former Soviet Union because they wanted to establish a valuable new fur animal in the wild. Raccoon Dog furs continue to be commercially sold, although today they are produced in fur farms. While the species is still commonly farmed for fur in Finland (albeit less intensively than 20-30 years ago), Raccoon Dogs are no longer farmed in Sweden or Hungary, where the last fur farm was closed in 1995. In Japan, Raccoon Dog fur is also used in the production of calligraphic brushes, stuffed animals, and other products. Today, Raccoon Dogs are mainly hunted because they are considered pests.&#160;In Japan, legal culling increased from the 1970s to 15,176 animals in 2012. However, the numbers harvested has declined from a peak of 76,000 in 1981. In China, about 15 million Raccoon Dogs were held by fur farmers in 2010, and China is the largest producer and exporter of Raccoon Dog fur in the world (Petry and Liting 2010). In Finland, the yearly hunting bag for 2013 was about 160,000 animals (Finnish Game and Fisheries Research Institute 2014). In Poland, where Raccoon Dogs are hunted from August to March, the annual bag was 450–600 in the early 1990s, but more than 11,000 are now hunted annually (Kauhala and Kowalczyk 2011). In Germany, 30,000 Raccoon Dogs were hunted in the hunting season of 2008/2009 (Anon., in Kauhala and Kowalczyk 2011).",Terrestrial,"<strong>Legislation</strong><br/>Not listed in the CITES Appendices.<br/><br/>In many countries in the introduced part of their range, where the Raccoon Dog is legally hunted, hunting is permitted year round (e.g., Sweden, Hungary). However, in Finland, females with pups are protected in May, June and July, and in Belarus hunting is allowed from 1 October to the end of February. In Japan, hunting/trapping of the species requires a licence or other form of permission and can only occur within the designated hunting season (November 15 to February 15). The Raccoon Dog on Mukojima island (18.4 km²), Hiroshima prefecture, is designated as a natural monument under the Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties, and permission from the Director-General of the Agency of Cultural Affairs is required for capturing the animals on the island.<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Presence in protected areas</strong><br/>Raccoon Dogs occur in national parks and other wildlife protection areas in Japan, where hunting and some other activities are prohibited. Elsewhere across their range, they occur in numerous protected areas and wildlife sanctuaries. <br/><br/><strong>Presence in captivity</strong><br/>In Japan, around 40 zoos hold captive animals and successful breeding has been reported (e.g., Kobe Municipal Zoo).

The species is inferred to have experienced a population size decline of at least 80% over the last 24 years (three generations; Nadler&#160;<em>et al. </em>2007) due to severe and persistent and ongoing persecution for the pet trade (Nekaris&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2010), in combination with habitat loss.","<p><span class=""apple-converted-space"">This species is nocturnal and arboreal, and is found in secondary disturbed forest, in plantations and to some extent in primary forests.

Although often seen alone, social pairs and trios can occur, as can adult infant/juvenile pairs. Occurs from sea level to 2,300 m, although it is less common at higher elevations. This species has been observed to go into torpor at higher elevations (Nekaris, 2014).

Together with other loris species,&#160;<em>N. javanicus</em>&#160;is one of&#160;the most common protected primates found in animal markets in Java (Nekaris&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2008, Thorn&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2009). Due to their non-leaping locomotion, their choice of sleeping sites in trees and bamboo that can be cut through and accessed, and nocturnal habits, the animals are easily caught by humans (Nekaris and Starr 2015). The majority of the trade is to satisfy a large domestic demand, with a smaller proportion being smuggled abroad to destinations like the Middle East and Japan (Musing <em>et al</em>. 2015). From there the species may appear on online videos which perpetuate the pet trade (Nekaris&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2013). The trade chain poses a perilous threat for many reasons. Conditions during transport (stuffed in boxes or sacks) and inappropriate husbandry techniques (poor diet and social housing, forced diurnal activity, excessive handling) afterwards result in large mortality rate. Slow Lorises are the only venomous primates; to avoid their bites middle men or traders cut or remove teeth, a process that almost invariably leads to the animal’s death (Nekaris and Starr 2015). If confiscated, reintroduction to the wild has proven difficult. Animals with no teeth are not viable candidates, and in a two-year study of 11 healthy radio-collared animals released, only two are known to have survived (Moore&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2015).<span class=""apple-converted-space"">  </span></p><p><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space"">Hybridization poses a real threat both on Java and elsewhere. Some taxa of slow loris are known to hybridize in zoos. Javan slow lorises have been observed on animal markets outside Java (e.g., Medan, Bandar Lampung on Sumatra) and other Indonesian slow loris species (<em>N. coucang</em>,&#160;<em>N. menagensis</em>) have been observed to Javan markets. Due to the morphological similarity of&#160;<em>Nycticebus</em>&#160;spp. misidentification is rife. Furthermore, there is a general feeling that ‘if it is a slow loris, release it.’ Not only does this pose welfare risks to the individual, but also translocated individuals may harbour infections and parasites, and could potentially hybridize (Nekaris&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2008, Schulze and Groves 2004).</span></p>","<span class=""apple-converted-space"">This species has been recorded at very low densities (0.02-0.20/km) (Nekaris&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2008).

Some small isolated populations persist in gardens and agricultural lands where they are at high risk from hunting and easily poached for the pet trade; severe population declines in these habitats have been documented&#160;(Wirdateti&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2004, 2011; Voskamp <em>et al</em>., 2013). A specific survey in Gunung Gede Pangrango reported a density of 15.6 individuals/km², with a calculation that some 70 slow lorises occupy the study area (Nekaris <em>et al</em>., 2014). Based on the results of the survey, a very slow walking speed was deemed important in being able to detect slow lorises. More recently Nekaris and colleagues (unpublished) surveyed East Java, increasing the geographic range of <em>N. javanicus, </em>finding it at sites including Tumpang Pitu Forest, Meru Betiri National Park and Salakan Forest.<br/><br/>The population is inferred to have declined by over 80% over the last three generations (24 years) due to exploitation and declining availability of suitable habitat; less than 20% of suitable habitat suitable for <em>Nycticebus javanicus</em> remains.

Currently, the population is estimated to number fewer than 15,000 mature individuals, and is thought likely to experience a continuing decline nearing 10% over the 10-12 years (three generations) largely as a result of ongoing habitat loss and degradation combined with persecution, and it is here provisionally listed as Near Threatened, based on approximating listing as threatened under criterion C1.","The Sechuran Fox occupies habitats ranging from sandy deserts with low plant density to agricultural lands and dry forests (Cabrera 1931, Huey 1969, Langguth 1975).&#160;The species is often observed in rural areas and disturbed environments from Piura department to La Libertad department in Peru.&#160;Occurs from sea-level to above 1,000 m, and perhaps as much as 2,000 m (Cossios 2009). It is an opportunistic omnivore, capable of being strictly vegetarian when necessary, and likely can survive with limited access to water (Cossios 2009).","The most important threats to this species are from the market for handicrafts and amulets and from persecution because of damage to livestock. In Peru, the typical attitude towards this species is one of persecution (68.3% of correspondents) or indifference (31.7%). The stated reasons for persecution were due to damage on domestic fowl and guinea pigs (65% of correspondents), the consumption of vegetal or stored goods (13.3%), and the belief of goat predation (10%) (Asa and Cossíos 2004). The Sechuran Fox also faces some pressure in agricultural zones and from urbanization and habitat degradation; indeed, habitat reduction or loss is considered the main threat to this species in Ecuador (Tirira 2001, Tirira <em>et al</em>. 2011).","This species was judged by Grimwood (1969) as being abundant at the time and not in need of protection. The Sechuran Fox is uncommon in Ecuador, where it is considered to be in decline (Tirira <em>et al</em>. 2011). Asa <em>et al</em>. (2008) estimated the total population to number fewer than 15,000 mature individuals, but these numbers must be regarded with caution since they are supported by very little empirical data. Surveys based on footprints in Coto de Caza El Angolo in Piura, Peru, recorded an average of 12.6 foxes/km (CDC 1989) and an evaluation in San Pedro de Vice mangroves (Piura) estimated a population of 18-23 individuals in 3,013 ha (Chávez-Villavicencio <em>et al</em>. 2015), giving a population density of 0.6-0.76 individuals per km².",Unknown,"The Sechuran Fox can be found in the coastal zones of north-western Peru and south-western Ecuador, between about 3 and 12°S (Asa and Cossios 2004, Cossios 2009). In Ecuador, it has been observed in Manabi, Santa Elena, Guayas, El Oro, Azuay and Loja provinces (Tirira <em>et al</em>. 2011). In Peru, it is distributed on the western slope of the Andes between the frontier with Ecuador and Lima. Specimens that have been recorded further south may be the Chilla&#160;<em>Lycalopex griseus</em> or another species as yet undescribed (E.

The most common type of handicraft made with fox parts consists of preserved adult animals in a ""sitting"" position. This activity is limited almost exclusively to the department of Piura. The practice of magic-religious rituals by shamans involving preserved Sechuran Fox specimens or parts is the principal human use of this species in Peru. The specimens are used to attract ""good spirits"" or ""positive energies"" during premonition rituals or to manufacture amulets (called seguros) with different purposes.

88135664,4819,Chrysocyon brachyurus,Near Threatened,,2015,2015-08-13 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The current population of Maned Wolves is estimated at approximately 17,000 mature individuals (≥ 2 years of age), with the majority of the population (&gt;90%) in Brazil. In the last decade or so, the species’ main habitats in Brazil have been subject to intense deforestation. A population viability model for Brazil generated using real and predicted deforestation rates over 15 years (three generations) resulted in an estimated reduction of ~20% in the metapopulation (based on current estimates of habitat loss ranging from 1.0 to 1.5% per year). If deforestation reaches the maximum estimated rate of loss (2% per year), then simulation suggests a national population reduction of 56% at the end of 100 years (Paula <em>et al</em>. 2008, Paula and Desbiez 2014). In addition to the estimated population reduction from deforestation, the species is also subject to other threats, including road kills, direct persecution by humans, and disease due to contact with domestic animals (Paula and Desbiez 2014). In other range countries (Argentina, Paraguay and Bolivia), the species’ status is even more precarious with small isolated populations and declining numbers due to the low quality of habitat and hunting. The Maned Wolf does not meet the thresholds for listing under criteria B, C or D, but taking into account the combined impacts of habitat loss, persecution and disease, it approximates the thresholds for listing under A3, and is therefore assessed as Near Threatened. The species’ situation is considered to be of major concern due to the various threats acting throughout its entire range and should be regularly re-evaluated.","In general, Maned Wolves inhabit open habitat types favouring grasslands, shrub habitats, woodland with an open canopy (cerrado), mixed forest/grassland, and wet fields (which may be seasonally flooded). Rocky fields associated with open grasslands in higher altitudes (1,000-2,000 m asl) can be an important habitat for the species in some areas (Coelho <em>et al</em>. 2008, R. Paula pers. obs.). In central Brazil, similar to Bestelmeyer (2000), who found Maned Wolves prefer areas with low to medium shrub density, Vynne <em>et al</em>. (2011) found they avoided areas where the closed canopy was ≥30%. Coelho<em> et al</em>. (2008) found the Maned Wolf strongly avoided the forested areas that border the Cerrado and Atlantic forest ecoregions. In northeastern Argentina, south/southeastern Brazil, and southeastern Paraguay, Maned Wolves have been recorded in the exotic eucalyptus, pine, soybean and sunflower plantations (Orozco <em>et al</em>. 2009, Soler 2009, A.J. Giordano pers. comm. 2015, R. Paula pers. obs.) and in remnants of &#160;Atlantic forest (Chiarello 2000, A.J. Giordano pers. comm. 2015). Also, the presence of Maned Wolves in populated rural and urban areas was also documented in the last ten years in Santa Fe, Corrientes, Chaco and Santiago de Estero provinces in Argentina (Pautasso <em>et al</em>. 2009, Orozco <em>et al</em>. 2013a). In addition while Maned Wolves preferred open, natural grasslands, they were as likely to use low-standing croplands within five kilometres due to the high density of rodents (Vynne <em>et al</em>. 2011). While Queirolo <em>et al</em>. (2011) proposed that Maned Wolves are expanding their former range in Brazil to include areas converted from inhospitable primary or thick secondary forest into open areas for grassland, agriculture and livestock. Muir and Emmons (2012) failed to find evidence of Maned Wolves expanding into agricultural areas in Bolivia. In Paraguay, preliminary studies with camera traps suggest that sustainable cattle-ranching was compatible with high Maned Wolf activity (A.J. Giordano pers. comm. 2015). Vynne (2010) suggests the foraging benefits of agricultural areas are negated when the crops become tall, homogenous, monoculture crops (e.g., sugarcane). Vynne <em>et al</em>. (2014) found that Maned Wolves may be tolerant of these habitat conversions as long as there are sufficient remnant vegetation patches for den sites, food, water and resting, including gallery forests (Dietz 1984), cerrado and marshy areas near rivers (Bestelmeyer 2000, F. Rodrigues pers. comm. 2015). &#160;<br/><br/>The omnivorous diet of the Maned Wolf includes a wide variety of plant material and animal matter, including fruits, arthropods and small- to medium-sized vertebrates (Dietz 1984, Carvalho and Vasconcellos 1995, Motta-Júnior <em>et al</em>. 1996, Azevedo and Gastal 1997, Motta-Júnior 1997, Rodrigues <em>et al</em>. 1998, Jácomo 1999, Santos 1999, Silveira 1999, Juarez and Marinho-Filho 2002, Amboni 2007). Although the frequency of plant and animal items found in faecal samples is approximately equal, the biomass of animal items is usually greater than that of plant items (Motta-Júnior <em>et al</em>. 1996, Santos 1999, Motta-Junior <em>et al</em>. 2014). The relative importance of specific food items may vary depending on location and season (Bueno and Motta-Júnior 2006, Amboni 2007). In areas of high food availability, the degree of overlap of home ranges increases and can reach levels of 92% between female-female and 100% for male-female (couple; Amboni 2007, Azevedo 2008, R. Paula pers. obs.).<br/><br/>While historically Maned Wolves were considered to be crepuscular-nocturnal in their activities, recent observations in Bolivia and Brazil reveal that their activity is actually variable or cathermeral, with activity patterns changing according to daily temperatures and the season (dry or wet; Emmons 2012). In Santa Cruz, Bolivia, Emmons (2012) found Maned Wolves tend to forage for longer distances when temperatures are cooler (between 21-28°C) and show considerable decreases in activity levels when temperatures increase (&gt;28°C). In addition, while the Maned Wolf is strictly nocturnal during the dry season, it varies in its temporal activity pattern during the wet season (Emmons 2012). These patterns shift some in southeastern Brazil, an area defined by higher humidity levels, abundant permanent water sources in the form of rivers, well-defined seasons reflecting extreme temperature differences, and shifts in the seasonal food availability. While the activity pattern of Maned Wolves in Brazil is cathemeral and affected by overall temperature and seasonality, the high degree of daily variation in minimum and maximum temperature in a season means that there is additional variation in the daily pattern each season (R. Paula pers. obs.). For example, during the dry season when temperatures drop to 5°C during the night, the species is more diurnal having higher activity during the day when temperatures are likely to be warmer. In contrast during the wet season activity is typically nocturnal, except after extended periods of rain when the species can be active during the middle of the day. &#160;<br/><br/>The home range of Maned Wolves is variable, ranging from 20-115 km<sup>2</sup> (fixed kernel, 95%). Despite considerable variation ranges average between 50-80&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(fixed kernel, 95%; Rodrigues 2002, Coelho <em>et al</em>. 2008, Azevedo 2008, Emmons 2012) and about 30&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in agricultural landscape of northern Argentina (L. Soler pers. comm. 2015). Food availability and habitat integrity have been linked to variation in home range size (Amboni 2007, Azevedo 2008, R. Paula pers. obs.). Sharing of home ranges has been noted in Brazil and Bolivia (Azevedo 2008, Emmons 2012). While home range overlap can be found during the breeding season, it is possible throughout the year in areas with high food availability. In these areas, the greatest sharing of home ranges is between females followed by male-female pairs with very little sharing tolerance noted among males (Azevedo 2008).&#160;<br/><br/>In northern Argentina the Maned Wolf shows a preference for open grassland habitats and also utilizing human disturbed areas such as cattle ranches (Soler and Carenton 2008). Direct competition with other carnivores has not been observed; however, scat analyses reveal that Maned Wolves, Crab-eating Fox (<em>Cerdocyon thous</em>) and Pampas Fox (<em>Lycalopex gymnocercus</em>) and Crab-eating Raccoon (<em>Procyon cancrivorus</em>) consume many of the same prey species (Soler and Carenton 2008).&#160;<br/><br/>Paula <em>et al</em>. (2008) calculated a generation time of 5.3 years in Vortex (using the exponential growth rate as another variable to account to the net reproductive rate calculations, which is the age-specific survival multiplied by fecundity over all age classes; see Lacy <em>et al</em>. 2015 for further details). Using the formula Sum (x l<sub>x</sub> m<sub>x</sub>)/Sum (l<sub>x</sub> m<sub>x</sub>) where l<sub>x</sub> represents the survivourship over x years and m<sub>x</sub> the maternity over x years, Paula and Desbiez (2014) calculated a generation length of 7 years. No differences on population reduction were observed when using the two different generation times.","The four main threats affecting Maned Wolf populations throughout their distribution range are: habitat loss and alteration, especially due to conversion to crop fields and pasturelands; human persecution due to livestock losses and cultural beliefs; increasing vehicular traffic in highways resulting in road kills; and pathogens contracted from domestic animals due to increased contact in disturbed environments (Paula <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2013, Emmons 2012, Orozco <em>et al</em>. 2013a).&#160;<br/><br/>The intensive conversion of native habitat for agriculture results in loss of optimal habitat and creation of areas often subject to desertification. The fragmentation of highly suitable habitat causes isolation of subpopulations and often results in the remaining intact landscape become intersected by high speed roads. Many Maned Wolves are killed on roadways throughout its range. In central Brazil, road kills are a threat of major concern potentially leading to local extinction of small, isolated populations as estimates range from four to 10 individuals killed/year in some regions (Paula and Gambarini 2013, Rodrigues <em>et al</em>. 2014). Similar impact of vehicular collisions was detected in marginal populations from Argentina where 21 Maned Wolves were reported dead along National Route 34, concentrated between 2000 and 2005 (Orozco <em>et al.</em> 2013a). The same negative effect is potentially true in the humid Chaco of Paraguay where increased traffic on the Trans-Chaco highway leads to numerous road kills each year (A.J. Giordano pers. comm. 2015). Extreme climatic conditions such as uncontrolled fires and droughts are likely to exacerbate the scarcity of living resources and consequently the loss on roadways, as Maned Wolves are forced to travel farther for food and water (Pautasso <em>et al</em>. 2009, Orozco <em>et al</em>. 2013a); the latter is especially important during periods when females are lactating (Emmons 2014).&#160;<br/><br/>Direct interactions with humans also pose a threat to the species. Conflicts with people, road mortality, the potential for infectious diseases spread by domestic dogs and direct persecution resulting from widely held superstitions and beliefs, are the primary threats facing Maned Wolves (Songsasen and Rodden 2010). In some areas of Argentina, Maned Wolves are persecuted with hunting, trapping, and shooting due to a mix of long-standing cultural beliefs, general ignorance of the species, and trophy hunting (Orozco <em>et al</em>. 2009, Orozco <em>et al</em>. 2013a, Soler 2014). In southeastern Santiago del Estero (Argentina), 30 Maned Wolves were reported sold to game ranches in a 10-year period (Orozco <em>et al</em>. 2013a). In Brazil and Paraguay, this targeted persecution of Maned Wolves extends beyond the traditional and natural medicine needs to include the low public tolerance of poultry depredation, for which Maned Wolves are constantly blamed (Paula <em>et al</em>. 2013, Cartes <em>et al</em>. 2014, A.J. Giordano pers. comm. 2015). In some areas this hunting pressure is so high it is having a significant negative effect on local Maned Wolf numbers (Paula <em>et al</em>. 2013). While illegal trade is not common, Orozco <em>et al</em>. (2009) found it was widespread in Argentina, and even included the sale of young animals or pups to private zoos and collections. Of the Maned Wolves kept in captivity in Argentina during the last five years 68% were wild born and came from/were victims of illegal trade, road collisions or were orphaned after their mother was killed (P. Gonzalez Ciccia pers. comm. 2015).<br/><br/>Domestic dogs pose a serious threat to Maned Wolves on several levels, as often times domestic dogs accompany humans into the field for recreation and hunting. In addition, both Maned Wolves and dogs overlap in their use of habitat that has been converted to agriculture and pasture. Dogs are known to pursue Maned Wolves, which often results in the killing of the animal (Soler <em>et al</em>. 2005, Pautasso <em>et al.</em> 2009, Orozco <em>et al</em>. 2013a, Soler 2014, A.J. Giordano pers. comm. 2015). In a study carried out in Argentina, 26% of sightings by local villagers involved close contact between Maned Wolves and domestic dogs (Orozco <em>et al</em>. 2013a). Dogs are also a source of infectious diseases and parasites. However the epidemiological effects remain unclear for Maned Wolf conservation. Rural domestic dog populations in Argentina had very high seroprevalence for <em>Neospora caninum</em>, canine coronavirus, canine adenovirus,&#160;<em>Dirofilara&#160;</em><em>immitis</em>, canine distemper virus, <em>Toxoplasma gondii</em>, and <em>L. interrogans</em> spp. In the same area, all of these agents (except <em>N. caninum</em>, <em>Toxoplasma gondii</em> and CCV) were serologically positive in local Maned Wolves (Orozco <em>et al</em>. 2013a). In a Bolivian population, Maned Wolves were serologically positive for two domestic dog pathogens (morbillivirus and parvovirus) that can cause pup mortality and high levels of potentially fatal (<em>Dirofilara immitis</em>) and debilitating (<em>Dioctophyme renale</em>) parasites were detected (Deem and Emmons 2005, Bronson <em>et al</em>. 2008, Deem<em> et al</em>. 2012, Emmons 2014). In Brazil, Maned Wolves were serologically positive for several dog-related infectious diseases including parvovirus, canine distemper virus, coronavirus, and leishmaniosis (Paula <em>et al</em>. 2014). These data from Bolivia, Brazil and Argentina suggest that other wild populations are at risk in areas where domestic dogs are present (May Jr and Felippe 2014). The frequent use of dogs for herding and hunting, along with their frequent foraging in natural habitats, could favour direct or indirect transmission of multiple pathogens (Orozco <em>et al</em>. 2013a).","A Population and Habitat Viability Assessment (PHVA) workshop held in 2005 estimated the total population (newborn pups, juveniles and adults) of Maned Wolves at ~23,600 animals, including 21,746 in Brazil, 830 in Paraguay, and 660 in Argentina (Paula <em>et al</em>. 2008). If only mature individuals (≥ 2 years of age) are considered, the population size is estimated at 17,000 animals, including 15,849 in Brazil, 613 in Paraguay, and 487 in Argentina (Paula <em>et al</em>. 2008). Numbers in Bolivia are unlikely to exceed 1,000 animals. Numbers in Pampas del Heath, Peru are less than 40 individuals, declining, and likely geographically isolated from the adjacent Bolivian population (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2012). The population estimates from the PHVA workshop were generated using Vortex simulation computer models and so do require some caution (Paula <em>et al</em>. 2008). Even though the species has been supposedly expanding into new areas in Brazil, the species’ overall range has contracted in the Brazilian Cerrado (its typical habitat) and in other countries. In addition, over the last 10 years some of the areas previously defined as the most suitable in Brazil have suffered from habitat degradation, suggesting that these prior published estimates may now be considered high.<br/><br/>To account for the effects of habitat loss, one of the main threats to Maned Wolf, on persistence, simulations of the effects of habitat loss using detailed data on deforestation rates in Brazil were performed (and measured as permanent reduction in K or carrying capacity). This was modelled as a linear decrease (1.5% / annum) in carrying capacity over one generation or five years, which effectively reduced the maximum size a population could attain. The simulation model showed that small populations were affected more than large populations, with populations &lt;25 individuals showing negative growth rates due to their vulnerability to stochastic processes. Populations with ≤25 individuals declined with a high probability of extinction within 100 years; however, populations of 50-100 individuals persisted, albeit with low levels of genetic diversity. Therefore, several hundred wolves may be needed to maintain a long-term, viable population depending upon the severity of threats, management goals, and acceptable levels of risk for wildlife managers.<br/><br/>In the last 10 years, the main habitats of Maned Wolf in Brazil have been subject to intense deforestation. For the current assessment, a population viability model was generated using recent observed deforestation rates, ranging from 1.0 to 1.5% per year over 15 years (three generations). These results suggested a 20% reduction in the metapopulation based on these rates of loss. If deforestation rates reach a loss of 2% per year, the simulation suggests a 56% reduction in the Brazilian population in 100 years (Paula <em>et al</em>. 2008, Paula and Desbiez 2014). The areas of supposed distribution expansion were not accounted for in this simulation since they represent edge areas for the distribution range and because from what is known presently these areas do not seem to hold stable and resident populations of the species.<br/><br/>Maned Wolves are found at low densities throughout the range. Even in Brazilian protected areas, population densities range from 0.01 to 0.05 animals/km<sup>2</sup> (Silveira 1999, Rodrigues 2002). The highest density reported is 0.08 individuals/km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in Serra da Canastra, Minas Gerais, Brazil (Paula <em>et al</em>. 2013). In Argentina, information about wild populations is scarce and the northern population is thought to be declining (Soler and Carenton 2008). Despite the lack of information on population densities across it range, high food availability may potentially support higher population densities (Amboni 2007, Azevedo 2008).",Unknown,"The Maned Wolf inhabits lowland grasslands and scrublands of central South America, south of the mouth of the Parnaiba River in northeastern Brazil, throughout eastern Paraguay east of the Rio Paraguay, extending into north/northeast Rio Grande do Sul State in Brazil, south to Santa Fe and Entre Rios provinces in Argentina and west to the Pampas del Heath in Peru (Queirolo <em>et al</em>. 2011, Williams <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>In Brazil, the range is limited by the Amazon forest in the north/northwest and by the arid Caatinga in the northeast (Queirolo <em>et al</em>. 2011). In the last five years, the Maned Wolf has been recorded in areas where no records (&gt; 50 years) previously existed, specifically in areas where habitat degradation and conversion are occurring. In the “Amazonian arc of deforestation”, south of Amazonas and south/east of Para states, the species has been increasingly registered in areas that were converted from forests into pastures and agricultural fields (R. Paula pers. comm. 2015). The same is true, but to a greater degree, in southeastern Brazil where the Atlantic Forest biome has been deforested and the Cerrado has been degraded (Queirolo <em>et al</em>. 2011). Although these records might suggest an expansion of the species’ distribution range, records are scattered and populations may not be stable. In Argentina, the species is present in the northern and central region of the country (Queirolo <em>et al</em>. 2011) but a range contraction has occurred in the south with most recent records in the provinces of Chaco, eastern Santiago del Estero, northeastern Córdoba, northern Santa Fe, northern Entre Ríos, Corrientes, and southern Misiones (Queirolo <em>et al</em>. 2011). The range across eastern Paraguay is considered widespread, but discontinuous, with no large concentration in any single area (Cartes <em>et al</em>. 2014). The Maned Wolf is distributed across the savannas of Bolivia; however, all detailed information for this country is limited to a single park in the department of Santa Cruz (Emmons 2014). The species historically ranged into northern Uruguay, but to date there have been only sporadic and unconfirmed occurrences in the north-east (Queirolo <em>et al</em>. 2011) since the last confirmed record in 1990 (Mones and Olazarri 1990).<br/><br/>Two recent evaluations of Maned Wolf distribution have provided an update on the full extent of the range (Quierolo <em>et al</em>. 2011), including range shifts within Brazil (Paula <em>et al</em>. 2013). These studies recorded that the Maned Wolf distribution covers nearly five million km<sup>2</sup> with ~72% of the range located in Brazil, which corresponds to an increase in the total area reported 30 years ago (3,414,169&#160;km<sup>2</sup>) by Dietz (1984). This increase in the Maned Wolf distribution is likely due to both genuine change (the species’ expansion into new regions) as well as non-genuine change (mostly new or additional records from the field).&#160;<br/><br/>More recently, to seek greater precision concerning the distribution range of the species in Brazil, potential distribution and probability of presence were modelled with Maxent, a software using maximum entropy algorithms (R. Paula and E. Ferraz pers. comm. 2015). All Brazilian biomes, with the exception of the Amazon and Caatinga, neither of which are suitable for the Maned Wolf, were modelled using &gt;1,000 presence points collected in the last 10 years combined with several variables (including topographic, bioclimatic, geophysical and anthropogenic) at a resolution of one&#160;km<sup>2</sup>. The results indicate that the potential distribution area for Maned Wolves in Brazil is 2,815,061&#160;km<sup>2</sup>. The majority (70%) of this area represents areas with &lt;25% probability of presence and those areas are considered unsuitable for the Maned Wolf occupancy. In addition, the highly suitable area (i.e., &gt;75% probability of presence) accounts for only 0.4% of the total of the species’ distribution area within Brazil. These declines in both total area and overlap with lower probabilities of presence reflect an increase in deforestation rates in the Cerrado over the last 20 years. While the species has been documented in other biomes, the model suggests a retraction of their distribution within the Cerrado due to the ongoing conversion of intact habitat to areas with agriculture and pastures; therefore, while there is evidence that Maned Wolves can persist in mosaics of natural and disturbed areas, extensive monocultures and exotic pasturelands have been indicated as unsuitable areas.","There is no commercial use. Indications are that the use of Maned Wolf parts for medicinal purposes does not involve any sort of large-scale commercial transactions and is confined to native folk medicine (Soler <em>et al.</em> 2008, Orozco <em>et al.</em> 2009, Emmons 2012, Paula and Gambarini 2013).",Terrestrial,"<strong>Legislation</strong><br/>It is included on CITES Appendix II. Maned Wolves are protected by law in many parts of their range, but enforcement is frequently problematic. This species is classified as Endangered in Argentina (Ojeda <em>et al</em>. 2012) and declared a Provincial Natural Monument in select areas, including Santa Fe, Corrientes, and Chaco (Soler 2014). It is classified as Vulnerable in Brazil (Paula <em>et al</em>. 2013). Hunting is prohibited in Brazil, Paraguay, Bolivia and in Argentina. The species is included in the United States Endangered Species list.<br/><br/><strong>Presence in protected areas</strong><br/>This species occurs in many protected areas in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Peru<br/><br/><strong>Occurrence in captivity</strong><br/>As of January 2012, 150 institutions held a total of 394 Maned Wolves (182 males, 211 females, one unknown) in captivity (Holland 2014).<br/><br/><strong>Other</strong><br/>In Brazil, conservation actions to reverse population decline have focused on addressing the issues associated with the human dimension. Raising public awareness and using proactive methods to prevent conflict are among the main tools used in increasing tolerance towards the species. In addition, campaigns to vaccinate domestic dogs in areas that border or overlap with Maned Wolf populations have been ongoing for several years (Paula <em>et al</em>. 2014). New proposals to reduce the high number of road kills in southeast Brazil have been discussed at a political level. The 2005 Population and Habitat Viability Assessment workshop for Maned Wolves generated an Action Plan aimed at addressing the five main themes that effect the long-term conservation of the species across its distribution: 1) threats and habitat management; 2) distribution and status; 3) environmental education, social aspects, and economic alternatives; 4) ex-situ conservation; and 5) population dynamics and modelling (Paula <em>et al</em>. 2008). Each of these themes address gaps in knowledge for the species or specific problems associated with the species survival. Each theme was broken into multiple goals with specific actions set to address the associated problems, names of personnel responsible for seeing the action is completed, timeline for when these actions should be completed, associated costs, potential obstacles, and expected outcome defined (Paula <em>et al</em>. 2008). As a follow up to this workshop, Brazil and Argentina used information on recent and ongoing changes in the species’ status and threats to modify the international Action plan and generate specific National Action Plans that could help direct local efforts in Maned Wolf conservation. In 2014, the Brazilian government officially recognized the technical advisory group (originally formed in 2010) aimed at assisting the government on implementing the strategies developed in the National Action Plan. A Maned Wolf working group has also been implemented in continental level under the coordination of the IUCN SSC Canid Specialist Group, with an aim to ensure long-term coordination among researchers across the Maned Wolves distribution and work together to share strategies directed at reversing population decline. &#160;&#160;<br/><br/>In Argentina, the GAAG (Grupo Argentino Aguará Guazú or Maned Wolf Argentine Group) was founded as a national strategy to develop, manage, execute, and monitor the Action Plan for the Maned Wolf’s conservation in Argentina. The group comprises 16 institutional members, which includes provincial and national government agencies, zoos, NGOs and research groups from universities and museums. Between 2002 and 2011, GAAG carried out 10 regional workshops aimed at: 1) mapping threats for Maned Wolf in natural habitats; 2) prioritizing conflicts in the wild and problems in captivity; 3) prioritizing strategies and actions for its ex situ and in situ conservation; 4) developing recommendations for conservation in the wild and management in captivity; 5) developing efficient education strategies for Maned Wolf conservation both <em>in situ </em>and <em>ex situ</em>, and 6) validating methodologies and strategies for conservation education. Since 2005, five species-directed projects have been developed and include work in five of the eight provinces in the Maned Wolf’s distribution (Orozco <em>et al</em>. 2013b). Extensive surveys of farmers and ranchers have provided valuable information about the distribution of the species and also about people's attitudes towards Maned Wolves (Songsasen and Rodden 2010). Ongoing education programs are aimed at changing negative perceptions of this wild carnivore (Soler 2008, Orozco <em>et al</em>. 2013b).",Neotropical,,false,false,Global
89624491,7950,Equus grevyi,Endangered,A2acd,2016,2016-08-25 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Grevy's Zebra has been assessed as Endangered under criterion A2acd. There was a population reduction of 54% over the past three generations (30 years) from an estimated 5,800 in the late 1980s to a current population of about 2,680 individuals. The species also qualifies as Vulnerable under Criterion C1+2a(i)&#160;as there are &lt;2,000 mature individuals.&#160;This number consists of approximately 2,350 individuals in Kenya (1,716 mature animals) in 2016 and about 230 individuals in Ethiopia (168 mature animals) in 2011. There is an estimated continuing decline of 10% over the next three generations if the population in Ethiopia declines severely, and additionally the largest subpopulation of Grevy's Zebra has &lt;1,000 mature individuals.<br/><br/>The population has been roughly stable over the past 10 years. It is considered stable or increasing in Kenya, but may be stable or declining in Ethiopia.&#160;In Kenya the proportion of foals and juveniles in the population has grown (Kenya Wildlife Service 2016). If this trend continues, it bodes well for the population in this country. In Ethiopia, estimates based on transect counts and some ‘sight-resight’ analyses suggest that in 2009-2010 the total population size was 228 +/- 53 (F. Kebede pers. comm. 2012), with the largest population numbering 196 individuals.","Grevy’s Zebras live in arid and semi-arid grass/shrubland where they can gain access to permanent water (Klingel 1974; Rubenstein 1986; Rowen and Ginsberg 1992; Williams 2002, 2013; Kebede 2013). They are predominantly grazers, although browse can comprise up to 30% of their diet during times of drought or in those areas that have been highly transformed through overgrazing (Kartzinel <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2015). Breeding males defend resource territories (water and food being the key resources) of 2–12 km²; the home range size of non-territorial individuals can be as large as 10,000&#160;km² (Williams 2013). They are extremely mobile and individuals have been recorded to move distances of greater than 80&#160;km, with movements determined by the availability of resources; lactating females, for example, can only tolerate one or two days away from water (Klingel 1974; Rubenstein 1986; Rowen and Ginsberg 1992; Williams 2002, 2013). Hence when pastoral livestock monopolize water, Grevy’s Zebras suffer. They often mill around watering points in the late afternoon waiting to drink, thus reducing foraging time. By drinking predictably at night they are prone to predation by lions and in some areas when co-habiting with plains Zebras, they are preferentially attacked (Rubenstein 2010).&#160;During the dry season, when they are dependent on permanent water, Grevy’s Zebra may stay nearer to water and tend to be more concentrated. However, in the Alledeghi Wildlife Reserve in Ethiopia, they are more concentrated during the wet season in order to avoid the pastoralists and livestock that move into the area&#160;during that&#160;season (Kebede <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012).<br/><br/>Between 2010 and 2014 the population of Grevy’s Zebras inhabiting the Mpala, Ol Jogi and Pyramid Conservancies in central Laikipia County, was monitored three times per year. During this period on average the population consisted of: 33% adult males of which 17% were territorial and 16% were bachelors; 40% adult females; 8% juveniles, half males and half females; and 19% infants of which 8% were males, 8% were females and 3% were of undetermined sex (Rubenstein and Brown pers. obs.). Therefore 33% adult males + 40% adult females gives 73% of the population as mature. Given that population projection models show population stability is maintained when the percentage of recruits (juveniles and foals) reach 30% (Rubenstein 2010), the Laikipia Grev’s Zebra population appears to be in relatively good demographic health (between 2004 and 2014).&#160;A decade of data on sightings of Grevy's Zebra numbers as well as age and sex class from scouts in the Meibae, Westgate, Sessia, Laisamas, Ngili West and Kalama Conservancies show an that the percentage of recruits (foals and juveniles) has increased from 9% to 22% of the population, with the 2016 Great Grevy's Rally showing a Kenya-wide age structure of 28% recruits. This indicates that this population is approaching sustainability.","Kenya’s Grevy’s Zebra Technical Committee recently assessed and ranked the threats to Grevy’s Zebras. In decreasing order they include: 1) Habitat degradation and loss induced by extremely heavy grazing by livestock (Rubenstein 2010, Low <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009); 2) Competition with livestock, especially over access to water and high quality rangeland (Rowen and Ginsberg 1992; Williams 2002, 2013); 3) Local hunting for meat as well as medicinal and cultural purpose; 4) Disease from contact with unvaccinated livestock, especially with respect to anthrax and babesiosis (Hawkins <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015); 5) Hybridization with plains Zebras, although genes currently only flow from Grevy’s to plains Zebras (Cordingley <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009); 6) Predation (Rubenstein 2010); 7) Anticipated land conversion for resort development and other large-scale initiatives for economic expansion.<br/><br/>In Kenya, hunting for skins in the late 1970s was the likely cause of the initial precipitous decline in numbers. Recent data suggest that numbers continued to decline because recruitment was limited by low levels of infant and juvenile survival. This was a result of competition for resources – both food and water – with pastoral people and their domestic livestock (Williams 1998). However, a low level of hunting of Grevy’s Zebra for food and, in some areas, medicinal uses continues (Williams pers. comm. 2002). Furthermore, access to existing water sources continues to decline in some regions and the water supply in critical perennial rivers has been reduced, most notably in the Ewaso Ng’iro River where over-abstraction of water for irrigation schemes has reduced dry season river flow by 90% over the past three decades (Williams pers. comm. 2002).<br/><br/>In Ethiopia, the Grevy’s Zebra population was in a declining trend during the last 30 years, due to habitat loss/fragmentation, drought, poaching and potential competition with livestock. Habitat loss, drought and poaching were considered to be the major threats. Illegal killing of Grevy’s Zebra was the primary cause of the decline (Kebede 2013). The Alledeghi Wildlife Reserve population is small and genetically isolated. Initial population genetics research on the mtDNA control region revealed two new haplotypes that so far are not found in any other Grevy’s Zebra populations. The nucleotide diversity levels for both the Alledeghi and the southern Ethiopian populations were extremely low (Kebede <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>Recently, Muoria <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2007) recorded an outbreak of anthrax in the Wamba area of southern Samburu, Kenya, during which more than 50 animals succumbed to the disease. Further research on disease prevalence is revealing that Grevy’s Zebra are a reservoir for Theileria and Babesia (tick borne disease), and the first case of West Nile Virus has been found in one individual; the first detected in a wild equid (Hawkins <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015). Disease represents a significant potential threat to fragmented and small populations of endangered species.","Grevy's Zebra suffered a severe population reduction between the late 1970s/early 1980s and the early 2000s, declining from a global population of around 15,600 individuals in the late 1970s/early 1980s (Williams 2002) to around 2,000 individuals in 2004. Since then there have been some signs of population recovery, with the population remaining roughly stable over the last 10 years. Over the last three generations (a generation is approximately 10 years) there has been a population reduction of about 54% from an estimated 5,800 Grevy's Zebra in the 1980s to ~2,680 animals currently.<br/><br/>The most recent estimates put the total population of Grevy's Zebra remaining in the wild in Kenya and Ethiopia at less than 2,000 mature individuals, based on 73% adults in well studied populations (Rubenstein and Brown pers. obs. 2014). This number consists of approximately 2,350 individuals in Kenya (1,716 mature animals) in 2016 and about 230 individuals in Ethiopia (168 mature animals) in 2012. The largest regional population numbering around 1,300 individuals (949 mature) is in the centre of the Samburu region of central Kenya. <br/><br/>In Kenya, the Grevy’s Zebra population declined from around 13,700 in 1977 (Dirschl and Wetmore 1978) to 4,300 in 1988 (KREMU 1989). They then declined further to 2,400-2,700 in 2000 (Nelson and Williams 2003) and 1,570-1,980 in 2004 (KWS 2012), to an estimated population size of 1,470-2,140 in 2006 (B. Low pers. comm. 2007); a decline of 85-90% over 29 years. In 2008, the population was estimated to consist of 2,400 individuals, indicating that either counting techniques had improved or that the population had stabilized or even increased, or a combination of the two (Mwasi and Mwangi 2007, KWS 2012). An assessment of all existing counts carried out by Kenya’s Grevy’s Zebra Technical Committee in 2012 estimated that by 2011 the population in Kenya was approximately 2,500. In January 2016 a comprehensive census of Grevy's zebra in five counties in Kenya was conducted (“The Great Grevy’s Rally”). The census comprised of 350 people (members of the public, conservancy members, rangers and scouts from conservancies and National Parks and Reserves, and scientists) driving over 25,000 km² recording Grevy's zebras using GPS enabled cameras. Over 40,000 photos of Grevy's Zebra were taken. The photographs were sent to the US-based IBEIS team to process the images, identifying unique individuals seen on days 1 and 2 as well as the number seen on day 1 that were re-sighted on day 2. From these three values population size estimates could be computed. In the future, such analyses will be performed by Kenyan scientists once the software is made publicly available. From the sight-resight analysis the population was estimated to be 2,250 individuals (95% CI of +/- 93; KWS 2016). For the first time, Laikipia county has the highest number of Grevy’s Zebras (supporting over half of Kenya's Grevy's Zebra population), surpassing Samburu and Isiolo counties, the traditional heartland of the species. An additional 80-100 animals were estimated in Tsavo, Oserian, Meru National Park, and the Laisamas area - areas that were too dangerous or inaccessible to survey during the census period (KWS 2016). The total Kenya population in 2016 is therefore estimated to be ~2,350 individuals. The population will be re-censused in August 2017. It is expected that the Kenyan population of Grevy's Zebra will remain stable, or may increase due to conservation efforts.<br/><br/>In Ethiopia, Grevy’s Zebra declined from an estimated 1,500 (or a possible maximum of 1,900) in 1980 to approximately 600 in 1995 (Rowen and Ginsberg 1992, F. Kebede pers. comm. 2007), to approximately 100 in 2003 (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2003). In 2006, the population in Ethiopia was estimated to be approximately 130 (F. Kebede pers. comm. 2007). The trend from 1980 to 2003 (23 years) suggests a decline of roughly 94%. Counts and ‘sight-resight’ population analyses of the largest population suggest that by 2011 Ethiopia’s population had increased to approximately 230 individuals (Kebede et al. 2012, Kebede pers. comm. 2014). However this population is mainly in the Alledghi Wildlife Reserve (196 +/- 53 animals, declined from 600 in 1970) and very few individuals remain in Chew Bahir (22 animals, declined from 1,500 in 1970) and Borana (10 animals) (Williams 2002, Kebede pers. comm. 2014).&#160; The population in Ethiopia is expected to at best stay stable, and is likely to decline.<br/><br/><br/>The density and area of occupancy of Grevy’s Zebra fluctuates seasonally as animals move in their search for resources. During the dry season, when they are dependent on permanent water, animals tend to be more concentrated. However, given that they can move up to 35 km from water even during the dry season, their densities are never high. They are most abundant and most easily observed in the southern portion of their range in southern Samburu and Laikipia counties, Kenya.",Stable,"Grevy's zebra is only found in the Horn of Africa, specifically Ethiopia and Kenya. Grevy's Zebras have undergone substantial reductions in range. Historically, they ranged east of the Rift Valley in Kenya to southwestern Somalia, and in northern Ethiopia from the Alledeghi Plain through the Awash Valley, the Ogaden, and north-east of Lake Turkana in Ethiopia to north of Mt. Kenya and southeast down the Tana River in Kenya (Bauer <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 1994). Currently, Grevy’s Zebra have a discontinuous range, and are found from the eastern side of the Rift Valley in Kenya to the Tana River. Currently there is a small, isolated population in the Alledeghi Plains northeast of Awash National Park (N.P.) in Ethiopia. From Lake Ch’ew Bahir in southern Ethiopia, the population extends to just north of Mt. Kenya although a few animals are found further southeast along the Tana River. A small introduced population survives in and around Tsavo East N.P. in Kenya.<br/><br/>Grevy's Zebra are considered to be extirpated from Somalia, where the last confirmed sightings date to 1973. There are no confirmed records that the species ever occurred in Eritrea or Djibouti (Bauer <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 1994, Yalden <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 1986). Sightings in South Sudan are questionable and need to be verified (Williams 2002, 2013).","In Kenya, Grevy’s Zebras are only hunted at subsistence level for meat and medicinal uses; commercial trading of skins has ceased. In Ethiopia, killing of Grevy’s Zebra for meat and medicine is the primary cause of the decline (Kebede 2013).",Terrestrial,"Listed on CITES Appendix I. Grevy's Zebra are legally protected in both Kenya and Ethiopia, although in the latter, official protection has been limited. Changing attitudes of local pastoralist populations towards the species has had dramatic effects on improving the ranging, foraging and drinking capabilities of Grevy’s Zebras. Scout programs in which community members participate in gathering essential data on the ecology and behaviour of their populations not only generates income, it transforms the scouts into Grevy’s Zebra champions which in turn helps change community attitudes and gather essential information when populations are at risk (Low <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2009). In addition, in Kenya Grevy’s Zebras have been protected by a hunting ban since 1977. While under the Wildlife Conservation and Management Act No 376 of 1976 (Part II of the First Schedule), Grevy’s Zebra was listed as a ‘Game Animal’ (Williams 2002); there is a chance that they will be up-listed to a legally ‘Protected Animal’ in Kenya.<br/><br/>At present, protected areas form less than 0.5% of the range of Grevy’s Zebra. In Ethiopia, the protected areas are nominal (Alledeghi Wildlife Reserve, Borena Controlled Hunting Area and Chew Bahir/Chalbi Wildlife Reserve). In Kenya, the Buffalo Springs, Samburu, Shaba N.R. complex and the private and community land wildlife conservancies in Isiolo, Samburu and the Laikipia Plateau provide a core and crucial protection of Kenya’s southern population of Grevy’s Zebra (Williams 2002). On the Laikipia Plateau, protection and reduced competition with domestic livestock, have seen Grevy's Zebra numbers increasing since they first expanded into this area in the early 1970s (Williams 2002, 2013). In addition, changing attitudes in Samburu county, the centre of its distribution, has enabled Grevy’s Zebra to share resources more equitably with livestock, thus increasing the proportion of infants and juveniles (Low <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009).<br/><br/>Habitat restoration through grass re-seeding and planned livestock grazing is targeting core habitat areas in Grevy’s Zebra range. Close monitoring of Grevy’s Zebra body condition during prolonged droughts is carried out by scouts and additional water provision made to ensure continued access to declining water sources (<a href=""http://www.grevysZebratrust.org/water-management.html"">http://www.grevysZebratrust.org/water-management.html</a>). In addition, supplementary feeding of Grevy’s Zebra during extreme drought is being piloted in Kenya (Grevy’s Zebra Disease Response Committee, 2013), and appears to have prevented a population decline during the 2011 drought in the conservancies of central Samburu County (Low and Rubenstein pers. obs).<br/><br/>Kenya has completed its second conservation strategy for Grevy’s Zebra (KWS 2012). It has 5 strategic objectives: 1) Coordination and implementation of the conservation and management strategy; 2) Enhancement of stakeholder partnership in Grevy’s Zebra conservation; 3) Enhancement of Grevy’s Zebra conservation and habitat management; 4) Establishment of a program for monitoring and managing Grevy’s Zebra population health; and 5) Enhancement of transboundary Grevy’s Zebra conservation.<br/><br/>In September 2016&#160;               a workshop involving Grevy’s zebra biologists, conservationists and the governors of the five counties where Grevy’s zebras live will be convened by Kitili Mbathi, the Director General of the Kenya Wildlife Service, at the Mpala Reseach Center. The workshop will explore options that will move the populations from ‘ sustainable’ to increasing’ and identify actions that the governors can commit to that will help make this happen. Future actions to increase numbers might include: restoration of grasslands, improved water access, addressing high lion predation rates in Meru County, and developing local capacity and supporting citizen science monitoring.&#160;<br/><br/>Ethiopia has held two workshops on the status and conservation of the Grevy’s Zebra.

97164299,16218,Pardofelis marmorata,Near Threatened,,2016,2015-07-19 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Marbled Cat is listed as Near Threatened although it is close to qualifying as Vulnerable under criteria A and C. The change in status from Vulnerable in the 2008 assessment to Near Threatened must not be taken to reflect an actual increase in population nor a reduction of threats, rather the increasing number of camera trap surveys across Asia have, in recent years, confirmed the presence of previously only suspected populations and in some areas have resulted in a higher than expected number of detections and individuals. Despite this, the Marbled Cat remains little known and, across its range, is recorded relatively infrequently, which has hampered efforts to accurately assess its status, so much so that the assessors could not make a unanimous decision, with some assessors believing that maintaining the status as Vulnerable was more appropriate, we therefore report Near Threatened as the view of the majority. Current data suggest the Marbled Cat is forest dependent but does persist in degraded forest. It is also present over a wide elevation range and in rugged areas – areas in which forest loss is slower than average for the region. Marbled Cats are also threatened by hunting, but currently quantitative data is lacking and we cannot assess the impact this is having on the population. There are no published estimates of population density for the Marbled Cat, however, across its range, density probably varies considerably, but given the large range (currently estimated at roughly 1,500,000 km²) the population density needs to be below one individual per 100 km² to qualify for Vulnerable under criterion C (fewer than 10,000 mature individuals), this seems implausible in several areas. In summary, the population is probably slightly too large and declining too slowly (<em>c</em>. 25%) to qualify as Vulnerable.<br/><br/>If future research challenges these key assumptions (presence in rugged terrain, over wide elevations, large geographic range, tolerance to some habitat degradation) or provides evidence of a substantially fragmented population, extremely low population density, heavy hunting pressure, or stronger support of the proposed species split, the status will need revising and it is likely that it would then qualify for Vulnerable, probably under criterion C.","<p>Current data suggest that the Marbled Cat is forest dependent, primarily associated with moist and mixed deciduous-evergreen tropical forest (Nowell and Jackson 1996), and may prefer hill forest (Duckworth <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1999, Holden 2001, Grassman <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005). The increasing use of camera traps throughout its range is revealing detections from disturbed areas (e.g. Mohamed <em>et al</em>. 2009, Mathai <em><em>et al.</em></em>&#160;2010), including recently logged forest (e.g. Ross <em>et al</em>. 2010), but surveys of oil palm plantations in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo have not detected marbled cats within the plantations (Ross <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em>&#160;2010, Yue <em>et al</em>. 2015). Grassman and Tewes (2002) reported a pair of adult Marbled Cats in a salt lick in Thailand's Phu Khieu National Park.<br/><br/>The Marbled Cat has never been intensively studied, but Grassman <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2005) report a preliminary home range estimate of 5.3 km² for an adult female who was radio-collared and tracked for one month in Thailand's Phu Khieu National Park. There is no detailed information regarding Marbled Cat diet, but it probably preys primarily on rodents, including squirrels (Nowell and Jackson 1996), and birds.<br/><br/>The Marbled Cat appears to be primarily diurnal (Ross <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em>&#160;2010, Lynam <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em><em>&#160;</em>2013).</p>","<p>  The Marbled Cat is forest dependent and forest loss and degradation is continuing across its range from logging and expansion of human settlements and agriculture, including oil palm plantations. The Marbled Cat is valued for skin, meat and bones, although it is infrequently observed in the wildlife trade (Nowell and Jackson 1996). However, it is possible that illegal killing and trade is underreported compared to other species. Targeted and indiscriminate snaring are prevalent throughout much of the range and likely to pose a significant threat. They have been reported as poultry pests (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Mishra <em>et al.</em> 2006) which also results in retaliatory killing. Records of hunting and skins are known from several areas in the state of Arunachal Pradesh, north-east India - Vijaynagar-Gandhigram in Changlang district (A. Datta unpubl. data), West Kameng district (Mishra <em>et al.</em> 2006), Pakke Kessang, East Kameng district (Lyngdoh <em>et al.</em> 2011), Ziro valley, Lower Subansiri (Selvan <em>et al.</em> 2013) and from Khonoma in Nagaland (Grewal <em>et al.</em> 2011).</p>","<p>There are no population density estimates for the Marbled Cat. In most surveys, detection rates tend to be lower for this species than some sympatric felids such as the Asiatic Golden Cat (e.g. Pusparini <em>et al</em>. 2014, Gumal <em>et al</em>. 2014, Than Zaw <em><em>et al.</em></em>&#160;2014) and both species of Clouded Leopard, but higher than others such as the Bay Cat (Ross <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em>&#160;2010, Hearn, Ross and Macdonald unpubl. data). However, in some surveys, when individual animals have been identified, a similar number or even a higher number of individual Marbled Cats compared to Clouded Leopards have been found (Hearn, Ross and Macdonald unpubl. data). It is therefore possible that low detection rates may under some circumstances arise from cameras placed inappropriately for Marbled Cats, it is also likely that the population density will vary greatly across the range and it is important to note that many surveys have resulted in very few detections. However, unless population densities are very low, or the distribution extremely patchy it is likely that the total population numbers over 10,000 mature individuals, although this is certainly in decline.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Marbled Cat is found from the Himalayan foothills in Nepal eastwards into southwest China, southwards throughout mainland Southeast Asia and on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra.

However, there is a general paucity of data for this species, with no density estimates or population data, making an assessment of the true status of the species difficult. The data that we do have indicate that the species has likely experienced population declines of over 20%, and approaching 30% in recent years due to extensive habitat loss and poaching across their range. This pattern is likely to continue in the future, and indicates that the Asiatic Golden Cat is very close to qualifying for a Vulnerable status under criterion A.<br/><br/>The Asiatic Golden Cat has been documented from twelve countries in Southeast Asia. Yet, despite this fairly wide distribution, its presence in India, Bangladesh and Nepal is limited and patchy (Datta <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2008, Khan 2008, Ghimrey and Pal 2009, Bashir <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2011, H. Rahman&#160;pers. comm.). It is reported infrequently from eastern Cambodia, Lao PDR, Viet Nam, and south China, with records in both China and Viet Nam declining drastically in recent years (Duckworth <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1999; Johnson <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2007; Gray <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2012,&#160;2014; Wilcox <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014; P. Riordan&#160;pers. comm.). It has not been recorded in Viet Nam since 2005, and extensive surveys carried out&#160; in Yunnan, Sichuan, Guangxi and Jiangxi Provinces of China have recorded Asiatic Golden Cat on only three occasions (Wilcox <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014, Beijing Forestry University unpublished data, Chinese State Forestry Administration unpublished data). It is likely to be extirpated from these two countries in the very near future. The Asiatic Golden Cat is distributed more widely throughout Bhutan, Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia, but the is thought to be experiencing population declines in these areas as well (Linkie and Ridout 2009, Sunarto 2012, McCarthy 2013, McCarthy <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2015, K. Kawanishi pers. comm., S. Dahal pers. comm).<br/><br/>The most significant threats to the Asiatic Golden Cat are thought to be habitat loss and poaching. Although the species has occasionally been recorded from degraded or altered habitats, it is primarily a forest dependent species, and thus is threatened by the significant habitat loss and fragmentation throughout its range (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Holden 2001, Grassman <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2005, Choudhury 2007, Wang 2007, McCarthy 2013, McCarthy <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2015). Although deforestation rates in Southeast Asia have slowed slightly, they are still among the highest in the world at roughly one million hectares/year between 2000 and 2010 (FAO 2011). Land conversion is also a threat to the Asiatic Golden Cat, and even in countries such as Bhutan, where the species is thought to enjoy a relatively protected status, an increase in hyrdopower projects has the potential to negatively impact the species. Poaching of the species is thought to be increasing in many areas, as it is often targeted for the sale of its pelt and body parts (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Duckworth <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1999, Lynam <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2006, Khan 2008, Aiyadurai <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010, Pusparini <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014, H. Rahman&#160;pers. comm., P. Riordan&#160;pers. comm., S. Mukherjee&#160;pers. comm., T. Gray&#160;pers. comm., S. Dahal&#160;pers. comm., A. Datta&#160;pers. comm., D. Willcox&#160;pers. comm.). Increasingly, the species may be targeted as a substitute for Tiger pelts and bones. In Viet Nam, there have been several incidences of confiscated Asiatic Golden Cat pelts that were painted to resemble that of a Tiger (D. Willcox&#160;pers. comm.). It is also the victim of indiscriminate snaring and hunting in some areas (Holden 2001, Khan 2008, D. Willcox&#160;pers. comm.). Finally, there are indications that the species is increasingly being killed in retribution for preying on livestock (mainly poultry) (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002, McCarthy 2013).<br/><br/>The lack of reliable density estimates severely limit our ability to accurately assess the population status and trend of the species. However, the decrease, or sudden absence, of Asiatic Golden Cat records from many areas, in combination with an apparently increased level of poaching, lead us to believe that the population is declining across its range. More rigorous scientific data for this species is needed, and may provide a strong basis on which to base change in status to Vulnerable.","The Asiatic Golden Cat is primarily found in forested areas, particularly tropical and subtropical moist evergreen forests, mixed evergreen forests, and dry deciduous forests. (Nowell and Jackson 1996, McCarthy 2013, McCarthy <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015). Two radio collared individuals (a male and a female) in Thailand occurred most often in closed forest habitats (Grassman <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005). However, the species has also been recorded from open areas such as shrub or grasslands, or open rocky areas, and from degraded or fragmented forest landscapes (Duckworth <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1999, Holden 2001, Grassman <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005, Choudhury 2007, Wang 2007, McCarthy 2013). A radio collared female in Sumatra was frequently recorded outside of a protected area in remnant fragments of forest located between coffee plantations (McCarthy 2013).<br/><br/>Records of the Asiatic Golden Cat have a wide altitudinal variation. The species was documented at elevations up to 3,960 m in the Khangchendzonga Biosphere Reserve Sikkim, India, at 3,738 m in the Jigme Sigye Wangchuk National Park in Bhutan, at 2,896 m in Trongsa, and at 3,900 m in Wangduephodrang (Wang 2007, Bashir <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011, S. Dahal pers. comm.). However, in some areas it appears to be more common in lowland forests. In Kerinci Seblat National Park in Sumatra, it was only recorded by camera traps at low elevations.<br/><br/>The Asiatic Golden Cat is remarkably polymorphic in its pelage. The most common coat color is golden or red brown, but it may also be dark brown or even grey. Melanistic individuals have been reported and may be predominant in some areas of its range (Holden 2001). There is also a spotted form which is called an “ocelot morph” due to its ocelot-like rosettes. To date, this form has been reported from China (in Sichuan and Tibet) and from Bhutan (Wang 2007). The most distinct features of this cat are the white lines bordered with dark brown to black running across the cheeks, from the nostrils towards the cheeks, at the inner corner of the eyes, and up the crown. The rounded ears have black backs with a grey spot. The chest, abdomen and inner side of the upper legs are white with light speckling. The legs and tail are grey to black at the distal ends. The terminal half of the tail is white on the underside and is often carried with the end curled dorsally. Males are larger than females.<br/><br/>Little is known about the ecology and behaviour of the Asiatic Golden Cat. It was once thought to be primarily nocturnal, however, recent data indicates that it may be more crepuscular or diurnal. Two radio-collared Golden Cats in Thailand’s Phu Khieu National Park showed mainly diurnal and crepuscular activity peaks (Grassman <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005). In addition, most camera trap photographs of Asiatic Golden Cats in the Kerinci Seblat and Bukit Barisan Selatan National Parks in Sumatra were taken during the day (Holden 2001, McCarthy 2013).<br/><br/>The home ranges of two radio collared Golden Cats in Thailand’s Phu Khieu National Park were 33 km² (female) and 48 km² (male) and overlapped in significantly (Grassman <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005).<br/><br/>One confirmed scat contained the remains of Indochinese Ground Squirrel (Grassman <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005). Scats from Sumatra contained rat and muntjac remains, and the stomach contents of a carcass in Thailand's Kaeng Krachan National Park included the remains of a small snake (Grassman 1998).","As a forest dependent species, the Asiatic Golden Cat is threatened by habitat loss throughout it's range. Although deforestation rates in Southeast Asia have slowed substantially, they are still among the highest in the world (FAO 2011). An increasing number of hydropower projects in countries such as Bhutan, also have the potential to negatively impact the species. In addition, the species is threatened by increasing levels of illegal hunting and poaching for consumption, and for the sale of pelts and body parts (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1999, Lynam <em>et al.</em> 2006, Khan 2008, H. Rahman pers. comm., P. Riordan pers. comm., S. Mukherjee pers. comm., T. Gray pers. comm., S. Dahal pers. comm.). There is thought to be some level of poaching or hunting of the species in every country across its range. Pelts have been recorded being traded along the Myanmar-Thailand border, and in Sumatra (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1999, Pusparini <em>et al.</em> 2014), and skins are reported from several sites in northeast India (Aiyadurai <em>et al.</em> 2010, A. Datta pers. comm.). Poaching pressure is particularly high in China and Viet Nam, where the species may soon face extirpation.  In Viet Nam, there is some evidence that the species is increasingly targeted as a substitute for Tiger skins and parts, as Tigers become more difficult to obtain. There have been several incidences of confiscated Golden Cat pelts which were painted to resemble that of a Tiger (D. Willcox pers. comm.). Snaring appears to be on the rise across much of mainland Southeast Asia, and constitutes a major threat to the species D. Willcox pers. comm.). In Bangladesh, several recent specimens indicate that the species is  commonly hunted by indigenous peoples in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. Conflict with humans due to livestock depredation is also thought to be an issue for the species. Retribution killing of the species in response to chicken depredation was recorded in Sumatra (McCarthy 2013).","A lack of density estimates across the range makes it difficult to accurately assess the true population status of the species. Owing to somewhat similar camera trap encounter rates, the Asiatic Golden Cat is thought to have comparable abundances to those of sympatric felids (e.g. <em>Neofelis nebulosa, Neofelis diardi, Pardofelis marmorata</em>). However, some surveys have recorded the Golden Cat more frequently than sympatric felid species, while others have recorded the it less frequently, so their relative abundance likely varies significantly across their range (Holden 2001, Duckworth <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2005, Rao <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2005, Lynam <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2006, Mishra <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2006, Bashir <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011, Sunarto 2012, McCarthy 2013, McCarthy <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2015). In addition, it is important to consider that the Asiatic Golden Cat is thought to be mainly terrestrial, which may influence the number of camera trap photos recorded in comparison to more arboreal felid species such as <em>Neofelis diardi</em>, <em>Neofelis nebulosa</em>&#160;and <em>Pardofelis marmorata</em>.",Decreasing,"The Asiatic Golden Cat has been recorded rarely and patchily from the Northeastern states of India (Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, and Sikkim), through eastern Bangladesh (Northeast and the Chittagong Hill Tracts) and eastern Nepal (Datta <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008, Khan 2008, Ghimrey and Pal 2009, Bashir <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2011, Lyngdoh <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2011, Lalthanpuia <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012, Borah <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Velho 2013, H. Rahman&#160;pers. comm.). It is reported infrequently from eastern Cambodia, Lao PDR, Viet Nam, and south China, and records in Viet Nam and south China have decreased drastically in recent years, with strong indications that the species may face extirpation there in the next several years (Duckworth <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 1999; Johnson <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2006; Gray <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012,&#160;2014; Wilcox <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014; P. Riordan pers. comm.). It is distributed more widely throughout Bhutan, Myanmar, Thailand, and Malaysia (Tempa <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, T. Dhendup&#160;pers. comm., K. Kawanishi&#160;pers. comm., S. Dahal&#160;pers. comm.). It is widely reported from the island of Sumatra, but not present on other Indonesian islands (Ridout and&#160;Linkie 2009, Sunarto 2011, McCarthy 2013, McCarthy <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2015).<br/><br/>This distribution may be somewhat generous, particularly in China and Viet Nam. In Viet Nam there have been several Asiatic Golden Cat pelts confiscated recently in local markets, however, they are of undetermined origin. A live individual has not been recorded in the country since 2005, despite numerous camera trap studies. It is likely that the species has been extirpated from most of the country due to widespread and indiscriminate snaring. In China, extensive surveys carried out with local protected area and provincial government teams in Yunnan, Sichuan, Guangxi and Jiangxi provinces have recorded the Asiatic Golden Cat on only three occasions (Beijing Forestry University, unpublished data, Chinese State Forestry Administration, unpublished data). It is likely that the species is, or will soon be, extirpated from large areas of its range in south China as well.",,Terrestrial,"The Asiatic Golden Cat is listed under Appendix I of CITES (as <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Catopuma temminckii</span>), and is officially protected over most of its range by national legislation.

97168578,22104,Trichechus senegalensis,Vulnerable,A3cd; C1,2015,2015-07-18 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is data limited with little new quantitative information since the previous assessment. Inference of a single generation time of up to 30 years in an unexploited population is based on data from the assessment for <em>T. manatus latirostris</em>. The level of threats, particularly hunting and incidental catches, appears to be continuing to increase throughout range with locally high rates and near extirpation in some regions. Lack of protein and continued poverty for human populations, and limited enforcement of national laws, are expected to drive increasing illegal hunting levels. Destruction of coastal areas due to development, mangrove harvesting, siltation and dams are resulting in reduced habitat. We infer a high probability that a 30% or greater reduction in population size will result within a 90 year three generation period (Vulnerable A3cd).<br/><br/>Using survey information from Côte d'Ivoire, Gabon, Guinea-Bissau, The Gambia, Senegal and Cameroon, and inferring what is known about Manatee habitat in other range states and Manatee density data for <em>T. manatus</em>, it is estimated that there are fewer than 10,000 Manatees in Africa. A continuing population decline of at least 10% in a&#160;90 year three generation period,&#160;is anticipated based on continuing and increasing anthropogenic threats (Vulnerable C1).<br/><br/>The African Manatee therefore qualifies for listing as Vulnerable.","<p>West and Central Africa contain a variety of suitable habitats for Manatees ranging from large and small rivers, coastal estuaries, freshwater and saltwater lagoons, shallow quiet coastal bays, lakes and reservoirs. Like <em>T. manatus</em>, <em>T. senegalensis</em> inhabits practically every accessible habitat (Powell 1996, Dodman <em>et al.</em> 2008). They have been observed or recorded from coastal areas, estuarine lagoons, large rivers that range from brackish to fresh water, freshwater lakes and the extreme upper reaches of rivers above cataracts. In general, their habitat requirements seem to be similar to <em>T. manatus</em> and require sheltered water with access to food and freshwater (Reep and Bonde 2006, Marsh <em>et al</em>. 2012). They may transit areas of unsheltered coast, but they are usually rare in these areas.<br/><br/>Optimal coastal habitats for Manatees, based on the movements of radio-tagged Manatees in Côte d’Ivoire and the number of reported sightings from other areas are: a). coastal lagoons with abundant growth of mangroves, aquatic plants or emergent herbaceous growth; b). estuarine areas of larger rivers with abundant mangroves (<em>Rhizophora racemosa, R. harrisonii, R. mangle</em>) in the lower reaches and lined with grasses, particularly <em>Vossia </em>and <em>Echinochloa </em>further upriver; and c). shallow (&lt;3 m depth) and protected coastal areas with fringing mangroves or marine macrophytes, particularly <em>Ruppia </em>sp., <em>Halodule wrightii</em> or <em>Cymodocea nodosa</em>. In riverine habitats that have major fluctuations in flow rates and water levels, Manatees seem to prefer those areas that have access to deep pools or connecting lakes for refuge during the dry season and seasonally flood into swamps, savannas or forests with abundant grasses and sedges. In central African countries including Gabon and Republic of the Congo, Manatees use coastal lagoons during the dry season and then migrate up rivers to feed in flooded forests and lakes during the rainy season (Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2008, Keith Diagne unpublished data). Manatees that live extremely far inland in rivers in countries such as Senegal and Mali use specific feeding areas where year round aquatic and shoreline plants occur and also feed on freshwater mussels and fish, and then spread out onto flood plains during the rainy season to feed on emergent vegetation (Keith Diagne 2014).<br/><br/>African Manatees feed primarily on vegetation, and over 70 species of plants have been documented to date as Manatee food throughout their range (Villiers and Bessac 1948, Powell 1996, Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988, Akoi 2004, Ogogo <em>et al</em>. 2013, Keith Diagne 2014). Some of the species more commonly observed being eaten by Manatees include: <em>Vossia</em> sp., <em>Eichornia crassipes</em>, <em>Polygonum</em> sp., <em>Crinum natans</em>, <em>Nymphea</em> sp., <em>Cyperus papyrus</em>, <em>Cymodocea nodosa</em>, <em>Ceratophyllum demersum</em>, <em>Azolla</em> sp., <em>Echinochloa</em> sp., <em>Lemna</em> sp., <em>Myriophyllum</em> sp., <em>Pistia stratioties</em>, <em>Rhizophora</em> sp, and <em>Halodule wrightii</em>. In countries including Senegal (Keith Diagne 2014), Cameroon (Takoukam and Koh Dimbot pers. comm.),&#160;and Sierra Leone (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988), Manatees are also known to eat small fish captured in fishermen’s nets. Manatees are also reported to eat freshwater and estuarine molluscs in many countries, including Senegal, The Gambia, Mali, Gabon, and Angola, and shell remains have been found in Manatee stomachs (Powell 1996, Collins <em>et al</em>. 2011, Keith Diagne 2014). Stable isotope analyses examined Manatee diet using samples from Gabon and Senegal and determined that molluscs and fish comprised 10% of &#160;Manatee average lifetime diet in Gabon, and 50% of diet in both freshwater and marine systems in Senegal (Keith Diagne 2014). Therefore, the African Manatee is not strictly herbivorous, but is omnivorous, a distinct difference from the other Manatee species.<br/><br/>Manatees can travel freely from salt to freshwater. They appear to prefer estuarine areas where there is little disturbance and the waters are shallow and calm. They can be found in marine habitats where there is relatively calm water and a source of freshwater. For example, in Senegal, The Gambia, and Guinea-Bissau, Manatees are attracted to a large network of freshwater seeps or springs that are found in nearshore marine habitats (Powell 1990).<br/><br/><em>T. senegalensis</em> are mostly solitary, with mothers and calves forming the principal social unit. Manatees will often rest together in loose, small groups of two to ten individuals and mating herds have been observed in Gabon, Senegal, Nigeria and Sierra Leone (E. Eniang pers. comm., Keith Diagne unpublished data). In some African countries such as Côte d’Ivoire, Manatees feed principally at night and travel in the late afternoon and at night (Powell 1996), but in other countries such as Gabon’s N’dogo and N’gowe Lagoons and in the Casamance region of Senegal they can be seen travelling and feeding during all hours of day and night (Keith <em>et al</em>. 2006, Keith and Collins 2007, Keith Diagne unpublished data). They usually rest during the day in water that is 1–2 m deep and sometimes in the middle of a watercourse or hidden in mangrove roots or under natant vegetation. They make little disturbance while swimming. The Manatees that are easily sighted during daylight hours generally occur in places where little hunting occurs.<br/></p><p><br/></p>","<em>T. senegalensis</em> population decline has been largely attributed to hunting and incidental capture in fishing nets (Cadenat 1957, Blancou 1960, Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2008). Although hunting is now illegal in every country in which the African Manatee occurs, laws are often not enforced and hunting and incidental captures are still not being accurately documented in most countries. Manatees are exploited for their meat nearly everywhere they are found, and in many countries the rest of the carcass is discarded. However, in certain countries such as Nigeria, Togo, and Côte d’Ivoire they are also hunted for their skin, bones, and oil for traditional medicines and rituals. They are hunted by various methods including nets, weirs, large box traps, drop traps using harpoons and snag lines, and hand-thrown harpoons (Kombo and Toko 1991, Powell 1996, Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988, Roth and Waitkuwait 1986, Akoi 1992, Collins <em>et al</em>. 2011). The African Manatee is at the greatest risk of extinction due to the high levels of human poverty within its range of distribution (Marsh <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>In Côte d’Ivoire, Powell (1996) sighted Manatees on a daily basis, but found numerous large box traps situated around the rivers and lagoons from the Ghana border to Fresco. The 4 x 1 m traps are constructed of wooden poles stuck in the bottom and a door weighted with a large rock. Powell (1996) built two of these box traps for catching Manatees to radio tag; he caught five Manatees in two traps over four days. These traps are also used in Nigeria and Ghana (B. Dunsin unpublished data, M. Yelibora pers. comm.). Manatees are also caught in special nets with large mesh used specifically for Manatees. In Guinea-Bissau, Silva and Araújo (2001) reported 209 deaths from 1990–1998; of these, 72% died in fishing gear, 13% were hunted, 4% stranded at low tide and 11% the cause of death was undetermined.<br/><br/>Incidental bycatch in fishing gear is also a major threat in all African countries, and even when captured alive, most incidentally caught Manatees are not released, but are killed. Takoukam <em>et al</em>. (2012) reported 13 Manatees incidentally caught and killed in fishing gear in nine months in coastal Cameroon. Cadenat (1957) recorded the deaths of five Manatees around Joal, Senegal in nets used for catching sharks. Manatees are frequently caught in monofilament nets that are now commonly used in all African countries. Manatees are occasionally killed in fishing trawls. In Côte d’Ivoire, stationary funnel nets are placed across the inlets of major rivers to catch shrimp swept past on tidal currents. These are strong nets that have a wide mouth that faces upstream and then narrows down to a small bag on the cod end. The tidal currents where they are usually set are often strong and several of these nets can block the entire channel. Between 1986 and 1988, three Manatees were killed in the vicinity of Grand Lahou by drowning in these nets, including one radio tagged Manatee (Powell 1996). Akoi (1992) described how Manatees in Côte d’Ivoire are sometimes caught in fishing weirs made of sticks. These weirs are common in Côte d’Ivoire and in many other areas in Africa.<br/><br/>In some locales there have also been reports of killings of large numbers of Manatees over a short period of time, such as 17 individuals killed in the Afram Arm of Lake Volta (Ofori-Danson and Agbogah 1995), 77 Manatees in the Cuanza River Angola in 1998 (Morais 2006), and 133 Manatees killed over three years in the Abanga River in Gabon (Louembet 2008). Johnson (1937) reported that as many as 12 Manatees a day were caught in a 100 mile (161 km) stretch of the Gambia River. Powell (1985) estimated around two Manatees a year were taken between 1978-1983 from this same area though this change cannot be attributed to less hunting pressure or reduced Manatee numbers (or both). If these large scale hunting operations are not curbed, it is entirely possible that the species will become extinct in certain places.<br/><br/>Due to poverty, remoteness and lack of enforcement, Manatees are taken for food and traditional medicinal products throughout their range (Powell 1996). Manatee meat is openly sold in local markets. In Cameroon, Manatee meat was sold along the roadside near Douala and could easily be spotted from a passing car. Manatee meat was seen on three out of five visits during a three month period (J. Powell pers. obs.). In the market in Lambarene, Gabon, Manatee meat was documented nine times between March 2012 and March 2013, as well as additional reports of Manatee being served in local restaurants during the same time period (Mvele and Arrowood 2013a). Manatee meat and oil is reported to move illegally in trade from Chad to Nigeria and Cameroon (Powell 1996, A. Wachoum pers. comm.). In Mali, Nigeria, and Chad, Manatee oil is more prized than the meat. The oil is used for its reputed medicinal properties to cure rheumatism and to condition the skin and hair (Kienta 1985, Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988). Oil from the head is used to treat ear infections. In Mali and along the Benue River, certain cuts of the meat are considered to have particular useful properties. For example, the parts of the penis are used to cure impotency in men, and the skin can be made into whips (Kienta 1985, Powell 1996). In Sierra Leone, villagers consume all parts of the Manatee carcass except for the heavy ribs (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988). The meat is shared among villagers and any remains are sold by the trapper. The bones are used to make handles for walking sticks or spinning-tops used in a local game called cii. Little historical data exists for comparison to the present to know if decreases in catch rates are occurring over time.<br/><br/>Recent threats include loss of habitat due to damming of rivers, cutting of mangroves for firewood and destruction of wetlands for agricultural development. Coastal development all along the western side of the African continent is decreasing Manatee habitat.<br/><br/>In recent times hydroelectric and agricultural dams have also isolated Manatee populations in many major rivers, including in Lake Volta, Ghana (Akosombo Dam, constructed in 1965), the Niger River (Kainji Dam in Nigeria, constructed in 1968, and the Markala Dam in Mali, completed in 1945), and the Senegal River (Diama Dam, constructed in 1983 and the Kayes Dam in Mali). Since 2008, the Niger River Basin Authority has authorized the construction of three additional multi-purpose dams: at Fomi in Guinea, Taoussa in Mali, and Kandjadji in Niger (Diarra 2011). An additional dam has also been authorized at Kayes Mali on the Senegal River. All of these are likely to further restrict Manatee habitat in these countries and lead to genetic isolation of populations. At the Kanji dam on the Niger River, Nigeria and at the Akosombo dam on the Volta River, Ghana, Manatees have been known to be killed in the turbines and intake of the hydro-electric generator (Powell 1996). In Nigeria, for example, Isahaya (pers. comm.) reported seeing as many as six Manatee carcasses at one time below the Kainji dam. An agricultural dam constructed in 2008 at Navel, Senegal on a seasonal tributary of the Senegal River killed five Manatees within the first four years after it was built: three due to drowning against dam grates and two due to entrapment behind the dam. Seven other live Manatees were rescued from behind the same dam and released back into the Senegal River (Oceanium Dakar and L. Keith Diagne unpublished data).<br/><br/>In countries including Benin, Senegal, and Angola, Manatees can become trapped in small lakes as rivers and flooded areas dry up in the dry season (Dossou-Bodjrènou <em>et al</em>. 2006, Morais 2006, Oceanium Dakar unpublished data). In some cases, such as during a severe drought in Lake Guiers in the 1970s, Manatees died due to stranding (Dupuy and Maigret 1978). In other cases, becoming trapped in these smaller bodies of water makes Manatees more vulnerable to hunting.<br/><br/>Coastal development near Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire resulted in loss of habitat and increased human disturbance contributing to the disappearance of Manatees in the area. Although still rare in Africa, increases in motorized boats and large vessel traffic in some of the rivers and lagoons may also pose a threat from collisions with watercraft, the highest known cause of death in Florida and Belizean Manatee populations. A pregnant female Manatee was struck and killed by a boat at a natural gas port at the mouth of the Congo River in Angola in 2007, and residents of nearby villages report a large decrease in Manatee sightings in the area since construction on the large facility began (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data).<br/><br/>National and international trade in live Manatees exists. In Nigeria and Mali Manatees have been captured for exhibit in local zoos. These Manatees usually die after a short time in captivity because their caretakers have not been properly trained and/or did not provide them enough food. Between 2000 – 2010, CITES records show that a total of 28 live Manatees were exported from four African countries (Cameroon, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, and Côte d’Ivoire) to aquaria in Asia (Japan, Korea, China, and Taiwan). Wild caught Manatees from Guinea-Bissau are offered for sale on the internet (River Zoo Farms). However, with the up-listing of the species to CITES Appendix I in March 2013, international trade is no longer legal.","<p>There are no population estimates based on quantitative information. Nishiwaki <em>et al</em>. (1982) and Nishiwaki (1984) made a number of intuitive estimates for 15 countries, based primarily on interviews rather than direct surveys. Roth and Waitkuwait (1986) and Akoi (2004) made estimates of 750-800 Manatees for Côte d'Ivoire. In 1999 a report by ABE estimated the Manatee population in Benin at 125 individuals. There are no population number estimates for other countries at this time. The first genetics analyses for the species indicated high haplotype diversity and strong population structure but included samples from few individuals (Parr 2000, Parr and Duffield 2002, Vianna <em>et al.</em> 2006). More recent mitochondrial DNA analyses using 63 new samples from eight countries identified sixteen new control region and nine new cytochrome-b haplotypes for the species (Keith Diagne 2014). These are the first African Manatee genetic results from Senegal, Guinea, Mali, Ivory Coast and Benin. New haplotypes were characterized by high haplotype diversity, but low nucleotide diversity, indicating expansion after a period of low effective population size (Keith Diagne 2014). Phylogenetic trees identified two clades aligned geographically, indicating regional population separation likely due to low recent dispersal (Keith Diagne 2014). Ongoing mitochondrial and nuclear genetics analyses will probably allow for population estimates for Gabon and Senegal in the near future (Keith Diagne unpublished data). The Lake Chad population has probably been extirpated. It was reported that Manatees were gone from Lake Chad by 1929 (Hatt 1934, Salkind 1998), and although reports of them occurred in the Chari, Bamingui, Bahr-Kieta, and Logone Rivers leading into Lake Chad, Salkind (1998) reported that they were gone from these waterways as well. Today the drying and desertification of Lake Chad no longer provides much suitable habitat.<br/>Available population information by country follows:<br/><br/><strong>Mauritania</strong><br/>The species occurs in the Senegal River and its tributaries (Powell 1996); this river forms the border between Mauritania and Senegal. It is an infrequent inhabitant of the Diawling National Park, a wetland reserve of interconnecting streams, lakes and ponds adjacent to the Senegal River near the Diama dam (Perrin 2001). Manatees also probably inhabit the Gorgol Marigot, a large seasonally flooded tributary east of Kaedi.<br/><br/><strong>Senegal</strong><br/>In Senegal, the Manatee was reported as close to extinction by Navaza and Burnham (1998) but more recent work indicates that this is not the case (Diop 2006, Ba <em>et al</em>. 2008, L. Keith Diagne and Oceanium Dakar unpublished data). In the Senegal River Manatees are permanently isolated from the coast by the Diama Dam, located in the Senegal River east of St. Louis, and upstream by the Felou Dam in Kayes, Mali which prevents them from moving further eastward. Manatees are no longer reported west of the Diama dam in the Senegal River delta near St. Louis or coastally in this region (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data ). However, Manatees are sighted throughout the Senegal River east of the dam. Manatees are frequently seen in Lake Guiers year round, and in 2005 Tocc Tocc Community Reserve was created for their protection along the northwestern shore of Lake Guiers. In February 2014, Tocc Tocc Reserve was designated as Senegal’s fifth Ramsar site. During the rainy season when the Senegal River floods, Manatees are regularly seen near Kanel and Matam in eastern Senegal (Oceanium Dakar and L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). As flood waters recede during the dry season, Manatees become stranded in seasonal lakes at Wendou Kanel and the local people, along with assistance from the Senegalese NGO Oceanium Dakar, have been rescuing and releasing them back into the main Senegal River since 1984. Beginning in 2008, Manatees became trapped behind a new agricultural dam at Navel, near Matam, on the Senegal River. Five Manatees died as a result of entrapment behind the dam, and dam grates were removed in 2010. Seven live Manatees were rescued in early 2009 and satellite tags were attached to three adult Manatees that were rescued and released back into the Senegal River (L. Keith Diagne <em>et al</em>. unpublished data). These Manatees used over 265 km of the Senegal River to the north and south of the release site and made directed trips to feeding areas (L. Keith Diagne <em>et al</em>. unpublished data). Manatees are also frequently sighted at freshwater springs that occur along coastal Senegal from the Delta Saloum region to the southern border of the country and beyond into Guinea-Bissau. In the Senegal portion of the Gambia River, Manatees are reported as far inland as Niokolo-Koba National Park during the rainy season (Grubb&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1998, Ba <em>et al</em>. 2008, P. Brillant pers. comm.), and they are also reported in this river across the border in Guinea (Théophile <em>et al</em>. 2008). In the Casamance River Manatees are reported as far east as Kolda, also at Basse Casamance National Park, and near the mouth of the river they can be seen daily drinking from a freshwater spring at Point St. George (Ba <em>et al</em>. 2008, L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). The only reports of recent Manatee hunting in Senegal are from the Delta Saloum region (IUCN and Parc National du Delta du Saloum 2005, L. Keith Diagne unpublished data).</p><p><br/><strong>The Gambia</strong><br/>In The Gambia, numbers are thought to have declined, but as of 1993 the Manatee was still numerous in the Gambia River. They have been fully protected for many years but are still believed to be hunted extensively (Perrin 2001, Jallow 2008). Manatees are reported throughout the Gambia River and its tributaries, and in Niumi National Park, Bao Bolong National Park, Kiang West National Park, and the Tanbi Wetlands Complex. There are no estimates of population numbers and little current research or conservation activities. In 2014 Manatee hunting was reported in Jareng in the Niamina East, and reports of incidentally caught Manatees were reported from Jareng as well as Tendaba in the Lower River Region (D. Saine pers. comm.). Manatees are also affected by the destruction of their habitat due to deforestation of mangroves (Jallow 2008).<br/><br/><strong>Guinea Bissau</strong><br/>Guinea-Bissau is considered likely have one of the largest Manatee populations in Africa, because of the relatively undisturbed state of its mangroves, wetlands and river systems (Schumann 1995, Powell 1996). Silva and Araújo (2001) found that Manatees occupied a wide variety of habitats and were most abundant around the Bijagos Archipelago. Based on interviews, a total of 256 sightings involving 439 individuals interviewed were reported. Powell (1996) reported seeing about 20 individual sterna from Manatees hunted in the Bijagos Archipelago by a single Senegalese fisherman who seasonally fished there. In 1997, the government signed an agreement with IUCN to develop a National Plan for Conservation of the West African Manatee in Guinea-Bissau, and some training and survey work started, but the work stopped when the war started in 1998 and has never resumed (Silva and Araújo 2001). The major source of mortality before the war was accidental capture in fishing nets; they were not extensively hunted. Silva and Araújo (2001) reported 209 Manatees killed between 1990-1998, approximately 23 per year. More recently, Manatees have been advertised by a private company for export on the internet, and two were exported to the Toba Aquarium in Japan in 1996 (Asano and Sakamoto 1997, Kataoka <em>et al.</em> 2000).<br/><br/><strong>Guinea</strong><br/>Little information is available on the Manatee in Guinea. The country has extensive suitable habitat (Powell 1996), but no systematic studies have been carried out (Barnett and Prangley 1997). Manatees occur in the Soumba, Konkouré and Fatala estuaries, Sangareyah Bay, Rio Komponi, Rio Nunez and the border area of the Guinean southern coast, notably in the Benty estuary (Théophile <em>et al</em>. 2008, Camara 2011). In the eastern side of Guinea, Manatees are reported in the Niger, Tinkisso and Gambia Rivers and at Haute Niger National Park (Théophile <em>et al</em>. 2008). In Boffa and Boké, Manatees are more easily observed during the rainy season, in channels when they are feeding (Théophile <em>et al</em>. 2008). Manatees are reported in the estuary at Dubréka, and a new research project will begin studying them there (O. Camara pers. comm.). In 2009 a Manatee carcass was recovered in Kanfarandé (C. Kpoghomou pers. comm.), and two Manatee calves were rescued from fishermen’s nets and released in Dubréka and Benty in 2011 and 2013 respectively (Camara 2011, O. Camara pers. comm.). According to CITES records, six live Manatees were exported from Guinea to China in 2008.<br/><br/><strong>Sierra Leone</strong><br/>The presence of Manatees has long been recorded throughout Sierra Leone. Early work confirmed its occurrence throughout the coastal areas of Bonthe and Pujehun districts and the Sierra Leone River estuary as well as in all rivers (Lowes 1970, Robinson 1971). Reeves <em>et al</em>. (1988) reported their presence widely in Sierra Leone, including the Great Scarcies, Little Scarcies, Sierra Leone, Sherbro, Wanje and Sewa river systems and Lake Mape. Manatees migrate between the Malem, Shenge, and Wange Rivers and probably move upstream near Teboh, and their presence is confirmed at Yeluba Island (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988). The southern side of the coastal area (Shenge to Sulima) is believed to contain the most important numbers of Manatees, but there are no data on population numbers (Siaffa and Jalloh 2008). Recent work by Siaffa and Jalloh (2006) reported that their occurrence in many wetlands is seasonal, with high numbers seen up rivers during the rainy season when the water level is high. They are also frequently reported devastating rice fields during the rainy season, and with the rise of the water level there is also an increase in accidental captures in fishing nets&#160;(Siaffa and Jalloh 2008). As of the late 1980s the species was still widely distributed in the country, but the catches at that time were thought to be unsustainable. The Manatees are trapped, netted and harpooned (Powell 1996). Although the Manatee is considered sacred in northern Sierra Leone, and therefore not directly hunted, when incidentally caught it is still eaten (Siaffa and Jalloh 2008). Hunting is most prevalent in the wetlands of southern Sierra Leone, where Manatee meat and oil are relatively common household food items, selling for approximately 2,500-3,000 Leone (less than 70 cents in USD) per half kg piece (Siaffa and Jalloh 2006). Heavy hunting activity is also reported in river mouths, particularly in mangrove areas (van der Winden and Siaka 2005).<br/><br/><strong>Liberia</strong><br/>Manatees have been recorded from the St. Paul River, Mesurado River, the lower Moro, St. John River, as well as the Cestos and Sankwen Rivers and in the Piso Lake region (Powell 1996). Information collected from fishermen and riparian communities in 2006 indicated that Manatees occur in the Cavalla River estuary in the southeast (Wiles and Makor 2008). The main threats to Manatees in Liberia are reported as accidental entanglement in fishing nets, direct hunting, boat collision (propeller injuries), and habitat destruction (Wiles and Makor 2008). No information is available on status and there are no current manatee studies in Liberia.<br/><br/><strong>Côte d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast)</strong><br/>Information about Manatee distribution and relative abundance in Côte d’Ivoire was collected for the first time between 1978 and 1983 by the German Technical Assistance Mission (MATA), which surveyed 107 sites and estimated that the number of Manatees living in Côte d’Ivoire was well below 850 individuals (Roth and Waitkuwait 1986). Akoi (2004) reported that the Manatee occurs along the entire coastal region of Côte d’Ivoire, as well as in all main rivers and their estuaries, and almost all lagoons. According to findings of surveys and the movements of individuals monitored by VHF radio telemetry from 1986-1988 and 2000-2002 (Powell 1996, Akoi 2004), six main areas of occurrence were identified: the Aby-Tendo-Ehy lagoon complex with the estuaries of River Tanoh and River Bia; the Ebrié lagoon complex with the mouth of River Comoé; the west Ebrié lagoon complex with the mouth of River Agneby; the Tagba-Makey-Tadio-Niouzoumou lagoon complex with the mouths of River Bandama and tributaries of Gô and Boubo; N’gni lagoon with the mouths of River Bolo and Niouniourou; the mouths of the Sassandra, San Pedro and Cavally Rivers. Groups of 10 to 20 individuals were observed several times in the N’gni lagoon in Fresco in the month of August (Akoi 2004). Human development is believed to be the reason why Manatees have completely disappeared from waters around Abidjan (Akoi 2004). A programme of research and education led by K. Akoi from 1986 until his death in 2009 was the longest running Manatee research programme in Africa to date. The population was tentatively estimated at 750–800 Manatees in five to six small, isolated populations (Akoi 2004). Illegal hunting is still a problem, as is habitat destruction including development and dams (the Kossou dam in the Bandama River and the Buyo dam in the Sassandra River). Hunting is illegal, but continues, with traps, harpoons, hook lines, baited hooks and nets all used (Roth and Waitkuwait 1986, Nicole <em>et al</em>. 1994, Powell 1996, Akoi 2004). There was some success in educating potential hunters and in enforcing the hunting ban in some areas (Akoi 2000), but unfortunately all programmes ended after the death of Akoi in 2009, and there are currently no research or conservation activities taking place. According to CITES records, four live Manatees were exported to Taiwan in 2004. At least two of these were sent to Farglory Ocean Park; one of these died in 2010 and the second is still in captivity at the park (T. Mignucci pers. comm.).<br/><br/><strong>Ghana</strong><br/>The African Manatee occurs in coastal and inland waterways in Ghana, particularly in the Afram arm of Lake Volta, and in the rivers Dayi, Asukawkaw, Obusum, Sene, Digya and Oti (Ofori-Danson 1995). Manatees occur in Abi, Tano and Ehy lagoons in the southwest of Ghana (Roth and Waitkuwait 1986). They are also found in the River Tano, the lagoons and swamps associated with the lower Volta and in Lake Volta (formed by construction of the Akosombo dam). There are reports of sightings in the tributaries of the river Tordzie, such as Lolo, Altra, and Hortor in the southern area of Tongu. However, there is no report of its presence in the White or Black Volta Rivers. Ofori-Danson and Agbogah (1995) concluded that the confluence of Oti could define the upper limit of the distribution area of the Manatee in Ghana. The African Manatee has become very elusive in Lake Volta under stress from declining water levels and hunting (P. Ofori-Dansen pers. comm.). In addition, environmental degradation in the Lake Volta is on the increase. The situation continues to worsen as the human population of Ghana continues to grow, urbanization and tourist development increase and human activities become diversified (P. Ofori-Dansen pers. comm.). As a result, there is growing concern to educate the populace and also to facilitate the Ghana Wildlife Division charged with the responsibility of managing the country’s terrestrial and aquatic wildlife resources to take action. Legal protection has been established for Manatees in Ghana, and the Wildlife Division prohibits trade and hunting of Manatees. However, the enforcement of wildlife laws protecting the Manatee is frustrated by a lack of resources, manpower and limited awareness of existing regulations (P. Ofori-Dansen pers. comm.). In 2007, the Earthwatch Institute supported a project entitled “Enhancing conservation of the West African Manatee in Ghana”. During this project, no Manatees were encountered, suggesting that the stock could be too depleted to support further removal and there is urgent need for enforcement and conservation measures (P. Ofori-Dansen pers. comm.).<br/><br/><strong>Togo</strong><br/>Manatees were previously reported in Kpessi, Agbodrafo, Abatékopé (near Aného), and in Lake Togo at Ekpui, Togoville, Kéta, Akoda and Kouénou, but this is no longer the case (Segniagbeto <em>et al</em>. 2008). The Manatee is observed in Lake Togo with its tributaries the Zio and Haho, and in the Mono River. According to the findings of surveys undertaken in 2006 among riparian communities and field observations, the Manatee population on Lake Togo is important (Segniagbeto <em>et al</em>. 2008). There are two concentration areas in Lake Togo: one in the south of the lake, and the other at the junction between the lake and the River Haho. The existence of these two concentration areas would justify the number of skulls observed in the villages of Amédéhoévé and Dekpo, which are the closest to those areas. It seems that the confluence between Lake Togo and the river Haho generally supports more Manatees than in the Lake Togo-Zio area (Segniagbeto <em>et al</em>. 2008). All interviewed fishermen exploiting Lake Togo have confirmed this. The population in the Mono River is very sparse according to fishermen, but there is a reported area of population concentration at&#160; Adamé. The northern distribution limit of the species in the Mono is in the village of Agomé-Glozou. Young Manatees are regularly observed by fishermen, and in Lake Togo, mating herds are observed especially when individuals are sighted in groups during the flood period of the Haho and Zio Rivers. It is necessary to design a significant map of former and current Manatee areas to establish an efficient conservation status, and to determine any impacts of the Mono River’s Nangbeto hydroelectric dam on Manatees (Segniagbeto <em>et al</em>. 2008).&#160;In March 2015, a collaboration between the Togolese NGO Alliance Nationale des Consumateurs et de l’Environment and the Togo Ministry of Security resulted in the arrest of a Manatee hunter in Dékpoé in possession of more than 20 skulls and 40 vertebrae of Manatees.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Benin</strong><br/>In Benin, the Manatee had been thought to be extinct (Perrin 2001). However, this is not the case (Powell 1996, Tchibozo 2002, Dossou-Bodjrénou 2003, Dossou-Bodjrénou <em>et al</em>. 2006). The Manatee is sporadically distributed across the whole country (Ichola and Tchibozo 2008). It occurs in coastal areas, including estuaries and coastal lagoons, in the great rivers in both brackish and fresh water, and in freshwater lakes, with reported sightings from both northern and southern wetlands (Affomasse 1999, ABE 1999, Guedegbe 2000). In the Niger valley, Manatees may be encountered in areas of medium depth at the confluences of the Mékrou-Niger and the Alibori-Niger, and in the branches of Bello Tounga and Kompa Gourou. Manatees are found in Bonou, Wébossou, Sèkodji Gomè, Ouinhi, Agonli-Houégbo (Kpoto) and Lac Sélé (Adjakpa 2002, Tchibozo 2002). They are frequently seen stranded in seasonal lakes off the Oueme River during the dry season (Tchibozo 2002, Dossou-Bodjrénou <em>et al</em>. 2006, Chabi-Yaouré 2012). In the Mono River, Manatees are seen migrating during high water periods, and are reportedly concentrated near the village of Hêvê and near the beaches of Avlo in the Boucle du Roy in Benin (Dossou-Bodjrénou 2003, Ichola and Tchibozo 2008). Manatees are hunted throughout Benin for food and traditional medicines (Ichola and Tchibozo 2008).<br/><br/><strong>Nigeria</strong><br/>The Manatee is distributed throughout Nigeria including the Niger, Benue and Cross Rivers and their tributaries, as well as coastally (Sykes 1974, Powell 1996, Awobamise 2008). Manatees are present in Lake Kainji above the dam and this population is isolated from other Manatees both upriver (by the Kandjadji dam under construction in northwestern Niger), and downriver by the Kainji dam (constructed in 1968). Manatees occur along the length of the Benue River and most of its tributaries, including the Gongola, Taraba, Donga Rivers, the Pie River as far as Yankari, the Katsena Ala River and the Deb River, which drains Lake Pandam, an important dry season refuge (Powell 1996, Oboto 2002, Sykes 2010). The Manatee is believed to be depleted throughout Nigeria due to hunting and incidental capture during fishing operations, including the use of explosives in rivers (Powell 1996, Oboto 2002, E. Eniang pers. comm.). It is hunted for its meat, oil and for organs used in traditional medicine (Oboto 2002, Awobamise 2008). There is no effective enforcement of protection laws. Another substantial threat is habitat destruction due to development and pollution of the Niger Delta by oil development. A fisherman of Sapele district reported that Manatees of different ages and sizes were found dead and floating after the Jesse petroleum pipeline fire incident (Oboto 2002). Several new studies of Manatees in Nigeria have begun in the last five years, including work by University of Uyo in the Cross River region (E. Eniang <em>et al</em>. unpublished data), a project training former Manatee hunters in aquaculture as an alternative livelihood in Lekki Lagoon near Lagos (B. Dunsin unpublished data), and a new study of Manatees in Lake Pandam (R. Gbegbaje pers. comm.).<br/><br/><strong>Cameroon</strong><br/>In Cameroon, Manatees occur throughout the coastal region, from the extensive mangroves and estuarine waters of the Ndian Delta and Bakassi area in the west to the Wouri and Mungo Rivers and the Cameroon Estuary, and south to the Sanaga River and the lower sections of the Nyong and Ntem Rivers (Nishiwaki 1982, Powell 1996, Noupa 2008). Manatees are frequently observed in the Douala-Edea Wildlife Reserve, the lower Sanaga River, and Lake Tissongo (Takoukam 2012). Manatees occur in the Sanaga River as far as Edea, where there is a dam and rapids, and in Lake Ossa (connected to the Sanaga), which has been documented as an important year round sanctuary (Powell 1996, Takoukam 2012, Mayaka <em>et al.</em> 2015). Inland, Manatees are found in the upper Cross River, especially around the Munaya-Cross confluence, and they also occur in northern Cameroon in the Benue River, from the Faro River and the Mayo-Kebbi to Lakes Tréné and Léré in Chad (Powell 1996). Manatees cannot descend the Benue into Cameroon south of the Lagdo dam. Although Grigione (1996) reported that illegal hunting was very limited in Cameroon, more recent reports have shown otherwise: Manatees are regularly hunted in the lower Sanaga region and Lake Ossa, and Manatee meat can be found in markets in Douala on a regular basis (Powell 1996, Takoukam 2012). Along the coast, incidental capture in fishing nets and habitat destruction are also problems (Takoukam <em>et al</em>. 2013). According to CITES records, two live Manatees were exported from Cameroon to South Korea in 2008, and four more were exported to China in 2010. A new marine mammal stranding network set up in 2013 that covers coastal Cameroon, the Wouri and lower Sanaga Rivers and Lake Ossa documented 157 Manatee sightings (comprising 349 individuals) and thirteen incidentally caught Manatees between February and October 2013 (Takoukam <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/><strong>Equatorial Guinea</strong><br/>The African Manatee is present in the coastal areas of Equatorial Guinea on mainland Africa, but is absent from Bioko and Annobón islands (Dodman 2008c). The main areas of occurrence are in the Muni and Cogo estuaries, and it most likely occurs in the Rio Woro estuary and the Rio Ecucu near Bata, where one was captured in 1988 (Républica de Guinea Ecuatorial 2005). Machado (1998) considered that the Rio Muni area contained prime habitat for the Manatee. Bolobo (2001) reported that the Rio Muni supported an appreciable population of Manatees. They probably occur in the lower reaches of the Mitémélé River on the mainland (Powell 1996). In the southernmost part of Equatorial Guinea, Manatees are occasionally sighted in Corisco Bay and around Corisco Island where sparse seagrass beds of <em>Halodule wrightii</em> have been documented (Keith and Collins 2007). There are no current Manatee research or conservation activities in Equatorial Guinea.<br/><br/><strong>Gabon</strong><br/>Gabon may have one of the highest densities of Manatees remaining in Africa (Powell 1996, Keith <em>et al</em>. 2006, Keith and Collins 2007, Keith Diagne 2011, Keith Diagne 2014). Reports of opportunistic sightings are common in the N’gowe and N’dogo Lagoons, particularly at the northern ends and in associated rivers (Keith <em>et al</em>. 2006, Keith and Collins 2007). During the rainy season Manatees are also frequently sighted in seasonally flooded lakes off the Rembo Bongo north of N’dogo Lagoon, including Kivoro, Gore, Longa Longa, Mafoume, Mouaga, and Marimossi Lakes (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). Louembet (2008) reported high Manatee seasonal use of the Abanga River and associated lakes, as well as hunting of 133 Manatees in this region from 2005-2008. Manatees are reported, but are sighted much less frequently in Mondah and Corisco Bays, the Libreville Estuary and Komo River, the lakes of the Ogooue region, and Banio and Fernan Vaz Lagoons (Mbina 2001, Endamne 2007, Keith Diagne 2011, L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). Bycatch occurs in gillnets and directed hunting is reported, primarily in the lower Ogooue River and associated tributaries and lakes in the region of Lambaréné, as well as occasionally in N’dogo Lagoon (Louembet 2008, Mvele and Arrowood 2013, L. Keith Diagne unpublished data, G. Minton pers. comm.).&#160;New mitochondrial genetics results for Gabon identified eight control region haplotypes, the highest number found for the species in any African country to date, indicating high genetic diversity (Keith Diagne 2014). Additionally, seven of eight haplotypes only occurred in a single water body, which may indicate strong local adaptation and low genetic mixing (Keith Diagne 2014). Manatees traveling between major lagoons and rivers in Gabon would need to move between these sites using the ocean, which has very strong currents and a narrow continental shelf. African Manatees are rarely documented in the Atlantic Ocean off Gabon, and with abundant food resources in rivers and lagoons, generally do not need to move between freshwater habitats. Similar geophysical barriers have been hypothesized to impede movements of West Indian manatees (Hunter <em>et al. </em>2012).&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p><br/><strong>Republic of the Congo</strong><br/>Manatees occur throughout coastal rivers, lakes and lagoons of the Republic of the Congo, and have been documented in Conkouati National Park, and the Kouilou and Loémé Rivers (Akoi 1994, Kaya 2005, Bal and Bréheret 2007, Kaya 2008). Surveys of Conkouati Lagoon and adjacent rivers and lakes indicated that Manatees are seen primarily in the lakes and at the mouth of Conkouati Lagoon near sandbanks (Akoi 1994, Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2006, L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). Surveys of the Kouilou River region conducted by the NGO Renatura (Bal and Bréheret 2007) confirmed Manatee presence in Lakes Nanga, Ndinga, and Katina, as well as the following tributaries of the Kouilou: the Mboukou Massi, the Loundji, and the Midounvo rivers. However, the same study concluded that Manatees were not present in Lake Youbi and presence could not be confirmed in Lake Koubambi (Bal and Bréheret 2007). In the Loémé River, Manatees are reported primarily in the lower river and its estuarine areas, and fishermen also reported that Manatees occur in Lake Kayo, south of the Loémé, in the dry season (Kaya 2005).<br/><br/><strong>The Democratic Republic of the Congo</strong><br/>Hatt (1934) and Powell (1996) reported that Manatees were common in the lower reaches of the Congo River. Manatees are regularly reported along the coast at Parc Marin des Mangroves and a hunted Manatee was observed at Boma in 2013 (S. Mbungu pers. comm.) Status is unknown, but given the frequency of sightings reported across the river on the Angola side (Collins <em>et al</em>. 2011) it is possible there is a sizeable population in the lower Congo River. Powell (1996) reported that a local name for the species exists in the upper reaches of the Congo River so it may occur there as well, although other reports for this region (Dodman 2008b, J. Hart pers. comm.) do not believe Manatees exist above the rapids, and today it would have to be an extremely isolated subpopulation since it is unlikely Manatees can traverse the extreme gorges in the river west of Kinshasa.<br/><br/><strong>Angola</strong><br/>Manatees have been reported along the coast from the Congo River in the north, to the Longa River in central Angola, but little information is available on abundance or status (Powell 1996, Dodman 2008a, Collins <em>et al</em>. 2011). Morais (2006) found Manatees in the Longa River, extending their southernmost range to that river from the Cuanza. Manatees have been documented the length of the Cuanza River and its tributaries and lagoons from the river mouth to Cambambe dam, which, prior to construction of the dam, was characterized by steep rapids that also presented a natural barrier (Morais 2006). The Manatees’ distribution also extends up the Lucala River (a main tributary on the north bank) for at least 30 km upstream from the Cuanza River. Key sites of the river basin include areas at and around Cauigia Lagoon, Cabemba Lagoon, the Tôa Lagoons, Quissungo Lagoon and a small extension of the Ngolome Lagoon, as well as in the Caua River and in the Massangano region (Morais 2006). Based upon boat and interview surveys conducted from 2007-2009 in the lower Congo River from the mouth to 40 km upriver, as well as numerous tributaries on the Angola side of the river, Manatees are commonly sighted in this region (Collins <em>et al.</em> 2011). One Manatee was sighted by the survey team in the Nzadi Caca tributary of the Congo River in 2007 and it stayed near the boat for 1.5 hours, surfacing approximately every 8-10 minutes (Collins <em>et al</em>. 2011). Only one local hunter was identified in all interviews of villages from the mouth to 40 km upriver, and he was interviewed by L. Keith Diagne before he passed away in 2008. The hunter estimated he had killed approximately three Manatees a week (using harpoons and nets) for the past 30 years (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). Manatees are hunted on the Cuanza River, Manatee meat has been seen for sale in the capital of Luanda, and a fisherman from a village at a lagoon on the Bengo River reported 77 Manatees killed during 1998 (Ron 1998, Morais 2006). Xavier (2011) documented a Manatee hunted by net capture in Lake Caúmba.<br/><br/><strong>Mali</strong><br/>Manatees are found throughout the entire Niger River system of Mali and in the Bani River but may have been reduced by hunting (Powell 1996, Berthe 2011). The Makala dam at Segou (constructed in 1945), another planned dam at Taoussa, as well as additional dams in Guinea and Niger, have chopped Mali’s Niger River Manatee populations into smaller habitat areas, and is of great concern for the conservation of the species in that country. There are no estimates of population numbers. In 2010 a Manatee carcass was recovered in Koulikoro (Timbo 2010), constituting the furthest inland record for the species, although there are reports of sightings further west from Bamako (Kienta <em>et al</em>. 2008). Manatees are frequently sighted in the Bani River near Djenné and Mopti, and have been documented regularly drinking from a freshwater spring near the village of Sokon (Berthe 2011). Manatees are also frequently reported in Lake Debo and the surrounding area in the inland Niger delta (Kienta 1985, Kombo and Toko 1991, Kienta <em>et al</em>. 2008). In western Mali Manatees occur in the Senegal River up to the Felou dam at Kayes, which prevents them from moving further upriver (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data).<br/><br/><strong>Niger</strong><br/>Poche (1973) declared the Manatee extinct in Niger’s Park W, but this is not the case. A study by Ciofolo and Sadou (1996) found Manatees throughout the Niger River in Niger. In the northern Ayorou region (extending from the border with Mali to Tounga Faire), Manatees were sighted throughout the year and a large number of skulls collected by hunters indicated heavy poaching (Ciofolo and Sadou 1996). In the region of Park W, Manatees were sighted in the main channel of the Niger River and a female was accidentally captured in 2002 (Ciofolo and Sadou 1996, Issa 2008). In 2010 a new Manatee study was initiated in this region (Boubacar 2010). In the southern Niger Boumba-Gaya section of the river, Manatees have been observed during low water periods, which may indicate migration elsewhere during other times of the year (Ciofolo and Sadou 1996). A male Manatee was captured in this area in 2004 but only survived in captivity for two weeks (Issa 2008). In June 2012, several Manatees were observed together in the Niger River in downtown Niamey near a major bridge (a possible mating herd). One female from this group was harpooned and killed by a hunter; the carcass was confiscated and biological samples were collected (Boubacar 2012). Manatees are heavily hunted throughout Niger for meat and organs (which are believed to have healing powers), and although the species is fully protected under national laws, there is little if any enforcement (Issa 2008).<br/><br/><strong>Chad</strong><br/>Manatees were once abundant in the Chad basin including the Chari, Bamingui, Bahr-Kieta, and Logone Rivers, but became rare by 1924 and are now believed to be extinct in this region (Hatt 1934, Powell 1996, Salkind 1998). Lake Chad is greatly reduced in size and desertification is a big problem there. Today Manatees occur only in Lakes Lére and Tréne, as well as the Mayo-Kebbi River which feeds the lakes from the west (Idriss 2008). In a survey in 1995, Manatees were found to be less abundant than formerly, but not uncommon in both lakes (Salkind 1998). Hunting continued on the rivers and lakes, despite enforcement efforts. The animals were sought mainly for their oil, which is shipped with dried meat to Cameroon (Perrin 2001). As of 2011 it has been reported that there are few Manatees left in Lakes Lére and Tréne, and that the local people have formed “militias” to protect the Manatees from Nigerian poachers who come across the border to kill them at night (J. Hart and A. Wachoum pers. comms.).<br/><br/><strong>Burkina Faso</strong><br/>Manatees inhabit all of the nations that surround Burkina Faso (Mali, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, Benin and Niger), but have never been reported within this country. They are present in Volta Lake above the dam (see Ghana above). However, Perrin (2001) could find no mention of its occurrence in the upper tributaries of the Volta (White Volta, Red Volta and Black Volta) or in the Mekrou River, which forms the boundary between Burkina Faso and Togo/Benin and drains the wetlands of the Parc National de l'Arly. Pending directed surveys, its occurrence there must be considered possible (Perrin 2001).</p>",Unknown,"<em>Trichechus senegalensis</em> occurs in Angola, Benin, Cameroon, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo. This species occurs in most of the coastal marine waters, brackish estuaries, and adjacent rivers along the coast of western Africa from southern Mauritania (16°N) to the Cuanza and Longa Rivers, Angola (9°S) (Beal 1939, Blancou 1960, Robinson 1971, Husar 1978, Nishiwaki 1984, Grigione 1996, Powell 1996, Perrin 2001, Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2008). They ascend most major rivers within their range until cataracts, dams or shallow water prevents their progress. In some rivers, such as along the Benue and Oueme Rivers, Manatees seek refuge during the dry season in permanent lakes that communicate with the rivers during high water but are cutoff when river waters subside (Sykes 1974, Chabi-Yaouré 2012). Manatees can be found 110 km offshore among the shallow coastal flats and mangrove creeks (with abundant seagrasses and calm water) of the Bijagos Archipelago of Guinea-Bissau (Powell 1990) as well as offshore of Delta Saloum, Senegal. In recent times, hydroelectric and agricultural dams have also isolated Manatee populations in many major rivers (see Threats Section). Manatees are found in the upper reaches of Niger River in the inland delta of Mali and as far as Koulikoro, which are the furthest inland records, over 2,000 km from the ocean (Kienta 1985, Timbo 2010, Berthe 2011, Keith Diagne 2014). They occur along the entire length of the Gambia River, penetrating into Senegal where there are records as far upstream as Niokola-Koba National Park (Grubb&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1998, P. Brillant pers. comm.). There are also reports of Manatees further upstream in the Gambia River in Guinea (Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2008). In Chad, Manatees are present in Lake Léré and Lake Tréné and in the Mayo-Kebbi river (Hatt 1934, Salkind 1998). Manatees are believed to have been extirpated from Lake Chad by 1929 and no longer occur in the Chad Basin (Salkind 1998). Centres of population appear to be Guinea-Bissau, the lakes and coastal lagoons of Gabon, the lagoons of Ivory Coast, the Niger River in Mali and Nigeria, Sanaga River and coastal Cameroon, and the lower reaches of the Congo River (Powell 1996, Silva and Araújo 2001, Keith <em>et al</em>. 2006, Keith and Collins 2007, Keith Diagne 2011, Takoukam 2012). The Manatee population in Africa is reported to be reduced, but their present range appears to be comparable to historic reports (Husar 1978, Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>Occurrence in major rivers from north to south including lakes within these river systems: the Senegal, Saloum, Gambia, Casamance, Cacheu, Mansoa, Geba, Grande de Bulba, Tombali, Cacine, Kogon, Kondoure, Sierra Leone, Great Scarcies, Little Scarcies, Sherbro, Malem, Waanje, Sewa, Missunado, Cavally, St. Paul, Morro, St. John, Bandama, Niouniourou, Sassandra, Comoe, Bia, Tano, Volta, Mono, Oueme, Niger, Mekrou, Benue, Cross, Pie, Katsena Ala, Deb, Okigb, Issa, Bani, Akwayafe, del Rey, Ngosso, Andokat, Mene, Munaya, Wouri, Sanaga, Faro, Chari, Bamaingui, Bahr-Kieta, Logoné, Mitémélé, Gabon, Ogooué, Nyanga, Lovanzi, Kouilou, Loémé, Congo, Loge, Dande, Bengo, Cuanza, and Longa.<br/><br/>Occurrence in major lakes: Lake Guiers (Senegal); Lake Volta (Ghana); Inland Niger delta (Mali); Lake Léré and Lake de Tréné (Chad); Lake Togo (Togo); Lake Aheme (Benin); Lake Onangue, Lake Ezanga, Lake Mandje (Cachimba) (Gabon).<br/><br/>Occurrence in major lagoons: Digboué Lagoon, Tadia Lagoon, Ebrié Lagoon, Fresco Lagoon, Bandama Lagoon, Comoe Lagoon, (Ivory Coast); Sakumono Lagoon, Lake Songaw Lagoon, Keta Lagoon (Ghana), Grand Popo Lagoon, Lake Nokoue (Benin); Badagry Lagoon, Yewa Lagoon, Lagos Lagoon, Lekki Lagoon (Nigeria); Nkomi (Fernan Vaz) Lagoon, N’gowe (Iguela) Lagoon, N’dogo Lagoon, Banio Lagoon (Gabon); Conkouati Lagoon (Republic of the Congo); Massabi Lagoon (Cabinda).","<span lang=""EN-US"">Manatees are exploited for their meat nearly  everywhere they are found, and in many countries the rest of the carcass  is discarded. However, in certain countries such as Nigeria, Togo, and  Côte d’Ivoire they are also hunted for their skin, bones and oil for  traditional medicines and rituals (see details under Threats). Live animals are also occasionally caught and exported to aquaria (see details under Population and Threats).",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"The African Manatee is one of the least understood marine mammals in the world, and has recently been shown to be the least studied large mammal in Africa (Trimble and Van Aarde 2010). They are often referred to as the ""forgotten"" sirenian. African Manatees were up-listed from CITES Appendix II to Appendix I as of the Conference of Parties 16 in March 2013. They are also listed on Appendix I of the Convention on Migratory Species and are protected by national laws in all range states. In 2013 the IUCN SSC Sirenian Specialist Group created an African Manatee Subgroup in order to focus conservation efforts for the species. Though African Manatees are protected throughout their range, enforcement and control of hunting appears negligible. Hunting is largely local and sometimes ritualized and the meat is usually consumed locally. In some regions, hunting is primarily opportunistic and meat and products are traded locally and across borders. Awareness of the protected status of the Manatee is widespread in most areas surveyed, but often there is little perceived fear of arrest and punishment (Powell 1996); enforcement is rare and fines or sentences for the most part have been negligible. Frequently when individuals have been arrested, the fine can be less than what is gained by selling the Manatee meat and oil in the market (Powell 1996). Although in general protection is minimal and offtake is probably at unsustainable levels, progress has been made in some regions to discourage hunting. Oboto (2002) mentions that in some parts of Nigeria people are afraid to hunt Manatees for fear of arrest. In Senegal the Ministries of Water and Forestry and National Parks have been very proactive in participating in Manatee rescue and research activities along the Senegal River and Lake Guiers, so people are aware that they will be arrested if they hunt Manatees, and as a result there has been almost no hunting in these places for at least the last five years (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). In an effort to encourage law enforcement agencies to arrest hunters, the Species Survival Network is creating informational posters that will be distributed to wildlife law enforcement agencies in all African Manatee range countries. It is important for Manatee researchers to work together with wildlife law enforcement and to provide data to assist the enforcement of Manatee protection laws, but to date these relationships are limited to only a couple African countries.<br/><br/>The species is believed to be in decline throughout much of its range, but without accurate baseline information it is impossible to know how to conserve these Manatees, and conservation is also unlikely without capacity building. A lack of long-term, committed funding, as well as the difficulty of accessing the extremely remote regions where African Manatees live, murky water habitat throughout their range, and the animals’ elusiveness, have severely limited studies. This species is only likely to be conserved through a network of grassroots, localized efforts by African researchers dedicated to long-term conservation and education efforts in their countries, and through increased funding to conservation activities.<br/><br/>Côte d’Ivoire had one of the most important Manatee conservation programs from 1989–2009 (Akoi 1992, Akoi 1994, Akoi 2000, Akoi 2004) but unfortunately it ended with the death of its leader, K. Akoi. Akoi’s staff were left with no support when funding was withdrawn after his death. This was a hard lesson that too often Manatee programs in Africa are dependent on the work of individuals. More people need to be trained and efforts need to be integrated into broader conservation programs so that Manatee conservation initiatives do not end if one person is no longer able to continue the work.<br/><br/>Many new African Manatee conservation initiatives have begun since 2008. From 2007–2009 the Earthwatch Institute (UK) funded annual training workshops for African biologists interested to begin Manatee research and conservation activities. The workshops were held at Lake Volta, Ghana and were led by P. Ofori-Danson, C. Self-Sullivan, and L. Keith Diagne. Over three years 33 participants from 17 African countries were trained, and equally importantly, a spirit of collaboration was born. When Earthwatch funding ended, L. Keith Diagne continued the training workshops in other countries, and built an African Manatee researcher network to increase and sustain communication between researchers in different countries, increase data collection, conservation activities, and educational awareness programs. The long-term strategy is to create a sustainable and cohesive network of African researchers who will determine population sizes and status of African Manatees in a majority of the 21 range countries, as well as develop and implement management plans for conservation of the species. The network continues to try to identify collaborators from all 21 countries. As of 2015, L. Keith Diagne has conducted five additional training workshops in Gabon, Mali, The Gambia, and Guinea-Bissau for 80 African biologists from 19 countries. In May 2010, Wetlands International Africa (WIA) conducted a training workshop in Senegal with a modular course given by P. Ofori-Danson to&#160;17 local experts and wildlife managers from six African countries. General recommendations for this initiative were presented afterwards (Morales-Vela and Castelblanco-Martinez 2011). In 2013 and 2014, A. Kamla Takoukam also conducted two training workshops in Cameroon for 30 biologists.

Some range countries have maintained status quo Clouded Leopard abundance, however, the majority of range countries have experienced moderate declines, with serious declines noted for Myanmar, Viet Nam and China. The causes of Clouded Leopard declines are attributed primarily to (1) direct exploitation, (2) range fragmentation, and (3) reduction in habitat quality. Clouded Leopard exploitation for pelts is well documented in several countries, including the infamous Tachilek market along the Thai–Myanmar border. The frequency of Clouded Leopard parts available at market indicates increased pressure from hunting (Oswell 2010). Ongoing deforestation in countries such as Myanmar and Cambodia is also leading to increased fragmentation and reduction of optimal habitat for Clouded Leopard.<br/><br/>A reduction of at least 30% in the number of mature individuals over the last three generations (GL of 7 years [Pacifici <em>et al.</em> 2013] x 3 = 21 years, 1993–2014) is suspected due to direct exploitation and habitat loss. The pattern of decline is not well understood given a lack of data on sub-population sizes and trend, and the rate of decline has probably varied. In a small part of the range we assume Clouded Leopard numbers to be roughly stable: Bhutan, Malaysia and Thailand, comprising roughly 12% of 2007 EOO and an assumed 12% of the 1993 population). We find it plausible that numbers in the remainder of its range declined at a mean annual rate of at least 1.63%, resulting in a minimum population reduction of 30% (a zero % decline in 12% of the population and a nearly 35% decline in the remaining 88%). As these threats are viewed as unlikely to cease and in some cases may not be reversible, an equivalent future decline is also suspected (a minimum future reduction in the number of mature individuals of 30% from 2015–2036). <br/><br/>We take a precautionary attitude toward uncertainty in this assessment. We are certain of relatively steep declines due to habitat loss and direct exploitation, however, the rate is not known and we assume a threshold rate that meets the A criterion for Vulnerable. Generation length could be lower: for example Yamada and Durrant (1989) reported that few Clouded Leopards in captivity were reproductively successful after five (F) or six (M) years of age, but we suspect these are dated observations given improvements in captive breeding. Also, generation length may be shortened in declining wild populations if mortality results in reduced longevity. If a shorter GL is used, and if we did not change our assumptions about the rate of decline, the suspected reduction would be less than 30% thus qualifying the species as Near Threatened. However, because we are even more uncertain about the total number of mature individuals than we are about the likelihood of decline, it is possible that they could number less than 10,000, and the species could also qualify as Vulnerable under C1.","The Clouded Leopard is intermediate in size between large and small cats, with wild females from Thailand weighing 11.5 (Austin and Tewes 1999) to 13.5 kg (Grassman <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005), and males 16 (Grassman <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005) to 18 kg (Austin and Tewes 1999).  Its coat is patterned with distinctive large cloud shaped markings, its canines are exceptionally elongated, as is its tail - for a large cat, the Clouded Leopard is highly arboreal (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).  They are strongly associated with forest habitat, particularly primary evergreen tropical rainforest, but there are also records from dry and deciduous forest, as well as secondary and logged forests. They have been recorded in the Himalayas up to 2,500 m and possibly as high as 3,000 m.  Less frequently, they have been found in grassland and scrub, dry tropical forests and mangrove swamps (Nowell and Jackson 1996).  Radio-tracking studies in Thailand have showed a preference for forest over more open habitats (Austin <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2007, Grassman <em>et al</em>. 2005).<br/><br/>A study in Thailand's Phu Khieo&#160;Wildlife Sanctuary&#160;found that Clouded Leopards preyed upon a variety of arboreal and terrestrial prey, including Hog Deer, Slow Loris, Bush-tailed Porcupine, Malayan Pangolin and Indochinese Ground Squirrel (Grassman <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005).  Other observations include mainly primate prey, but also Muntjac and Argus Pheasant (Nowell and Jackson 1996).  Clouded Leopards are primarily nocturnal, with crepuscular activity peaks (Grassman <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005, Austin <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2007).<br/><br/>Two radio-telemetry studies in different parks in Thailand found that adult male and female Clouded Leopards had similar home range sizes between 30-40 km² in size (95% fixed kernel estimators), with smaller intensively used core areas of 3-5 km² (Grassman <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005, Austin <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2007).  While both studies found substantial home range overlap between males and females, as is typical of most felids, Grassman <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2005) also found that the ranges of their two radio-collared males overlapped by a significant amount (39%).  Although both studies found similar home ranges, clouded leopards in Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary travelled approximately twice the average daily distance (average 2 km) than Clouded Leopards in Khao Yai National Park (Grassman <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005, Austin <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2007).<br/><br/>Clouded Leopards may occur at higher densities when densities of the larger cats, Tigers and Leopards, are lower (Lynam <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2001, Grassman <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005, Rao <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005).","Clouded Leopards prefer closed forest (Grassman <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005, Austin <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007), and their habitat in Southeast Asia is undergoing the world's fastest deforestation rate (1.2-1.3% a year since 1990: FAO 2007).<br/><br/>The Clouded Leopard is hunted for the illegal wildlife trade&#160;–&#160;large numbers of skins have been seen in market surveys, and there is also trade in bones for medicines, meat for exotic dishes and live animals for the pet trade (Hunter 2011). Wild animals are likely to be the primary source, but there is also some illegal trade from captive animals (Nowell 2007). Clouded Leopard exploitation for pelts are well documented in several countries, including the infamous Tachilek market along the Thai–Myanmar border. The frequency of Clouded Leopard parts available at market indicates increased pressure from hunting (Oswell 2010). Data from Tachilek on the Myanmar–Thailand border (19 surveys, 1991–2013) and Mong La on the Myanmar–China border (seven surveys, 2001–2014) show that the most common species in trade was the Clouded Leopard <em>Neofelis nebulosa</em> (482 individuals, observed in 22/24 surveys. However, the trade of cat parts from Myanmar into Thailand has diminished and reaffirms the role of China in the trade of cats out of Myanmar (Nijman and Shepherd 2015).","The Clouded Leopard is most strongly associated with primary tropical forest which is rapidly disappearing across its range (Hunter 2011, Nowell and Jackson 1996), and Clouded Leopard skins have been observed in large numbers in illegal wildlife trade in Southeast Asia (Nowell 2007).  Increasing use of camera traps has helped to better document its distribution and recent research efforts should help improve understanding of its population status (Grassman <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005, Austin <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2007).",Decreasing,"The Clouded Leopard is found from the Himalayan foothills in Nepal through mainland Southeast Asia into China (Nowell and Jackson 1996).

97218336,3787,Capra falconeri,Near Threatened,,2015,2014-09-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p><span lang=""EN-US"">This species is assessed as Near Threatened: it nearly qualifies as Vulnerable under criterion C2a(i) as there are less than 10,000 mature individuals (estimated 5,808, based on our analysis of data from 2011-2013) and each subpopulation, except one, has less than 1,000 mature individuals. The largest subpopulation had an estimated 1,697 mature individuals in 2011. There is no observed, estimated, projected or inferred continuing decline of the total population. However, stable and increasing subpopulations are restricted to areas with sustainable hunting management and protected areas. Were these conservation activities to cease in the future, poaching would likely increase, possibly changing positive trajectories in these areas downward, and the species would then qualify as Vulnerable.<br/><br/>The previous (2008) assessment of Endangered appears erroneous. The data available would have qualified the taxon for the category Vulnerable based on criterion C with &lt;10,000 mature individuals, because the most recent estimates cited by Valdez (2008) ranged from 5,080 to 5,630 (mean 5,355) individuals, of which 60% or 3,213 would have been mature animals. Further, there had been an inferred continuous decline (C1), and in the largest subpopulation in the Torghar Hills there were an estimated 1,600 individuals, of which 960 (60%) would be assumed to be mature, just meeting the threshold of criterion C2a(i) for the category Vulnerable.<br/><br/>The reason for the change from category Vulnerable (the corrected 2008 assessment) to Near Threatened is Genuine (recent, since assessments 1994, 1996 and 2008). Available data show that the earlier population decline had ceased for more than five years due to effective conservation measures. This has led to the stabilization of key subpopulations and increase in parts of the species range. Since 2002, the largest subpopulation has been estimated at &gt;1,000 mature individuals for a number of years. Thus, criteria C1 and C2a(i) for Vulnerable have not been met for five or more years.</p>","<em>Capra falconeri</em> is adapted to mountainous terrain with steep cliffs, between 600 and 3,600 m elevation. The species is typically found in areas with open woodlands, scrublands and light forests. In Pakistan and India these are made up primarily of oaks (e.g. <em>Quercus ilex</em>), pines (e.g. <em>Pinus gerardiana</em>), junipers (e.g. <em>Juniperus macropoda</em>) and Deodar Cedar (<em>Cedrus deodora</em>) as well as spruce (<em>Picea smithiana</em>) and fir (<em>Abies spectabilis, A. pindrow</em>) in certain areas. In Tajikistan the vegetation in the lower parts consists of open woodland and shrub communities with Pistachio (<em>Pistacia vera</em>), Redbud (<em>Cercis griffithii</em>) and Almond (<em>Amygdalus bucharica</em>); with increasing elevation juniper trees (<em>Juniperus seravschanica</em>), (<em>J. semiglobosa</em>), mixed with shrubs of maple (<em>Acer regelii</em>, <em>A. turkestanicum</em>), rose (<em>Rosa kokanica</em>), honeysuckle (<em>Lonicera nummulariifolia</em>) and <em>Cotoneaster spp.</em>. Markhor rarely use the high mountain zone above the tree line. Markhor are diurnal, but most active in the early morning and late afternoon. They alternate seasonally between grazing (summer) and browsing (winter), eating grasses and leaves. Females gestate for 135-170 days and give birth typically to 1-2 kids. The animals are sexually mature at 18-30 months, and live up to 12-13 years. Predators include Wolf (<em>Canis lupus</em>), Snow Leopard (<em>Panthera uncia</em>), Lynx (<em>Lynx lynx</em>) and on kids Golden Eagle (<em>Aquila chrysaetos</em>). <em></em>","<em></em><em><strong>Capra falconeri falconeri<br/></strong></em><br/>Within Afghanistan, Markhor have traditionally been hunted in Nuristan and Laghman, and this may have intensified during the Afghan wars since 1979. According to surveys by WCS in Nuristan during 2006-2007 and 2008 (WCS 2008), Markhor continue to be the most important game for local hunters (despite a nominal nationwide ban on hunting). Petocz and Larsson (1977) wrote that rangelands and forests were likely capable of supporting a higher Markhor population than that observed. They assumed that impact of livestock grazing on habitat conditions was limited because the number of domestic animals was restricted by the area's capacity to produce and store winter fodder, as heavy snowfall prevents winter grazing. Recent numbers of livestock are unknown for Nuristan, but recent increases associated with an expanding human population may create competition for forage (WCS 2008). According to a study using recent satellite imagery (Delattre and Rahmani 2007) no large-scale deforestation of the coniferous forests was observed in Markhor habitat in Afghanistan. However, the extent of deforestation for the last five years in a region affected by war and largely out of state control is unknown.<p><br/>In India, all Markhor populations are small (usually &lt; 50) and fragmented. The largest population, in Kajinag, may have potential for long-term survival if immediate conservation measures can be implemented. Key threats to the Markhor’s range are insurgency-related effects, intensified local resource use, poaching, and large-scale development. Poaching by professional hunters may have been the primary cause of decimation of Markhor in the past, but communal hunting during winter was practised until recently. Armed conflicts may have increased poaching by both the military and militants, while poaching by local people may have declined due to confiscation of arms and restriction on human movements. Other pressures come from habitat encroachment by camps of Gujjars and the armed forces, excessive livestock grazing by local and nomadic Bakkarwal herders in parts of the range, and collection of timber and other forest products. Large scale development includes the proposed Mughal road connecting the state capital Srinagar with Rajouri, which passes through the Hirpura Wildlife Sanctuary, and limestone and gypsum mining around Limbar and Lacchipora Wildlife Sanctuaries. The Indian Government has fenced the entire Line of Control with multi-layered barbed wire. This may have caused further fragmentation of populations of Markhor (Bhatnagar <em>et al. </em>2009). <br/><br/>In Pakistan, control of poaching in Chitral Gol National Park and in several community-based conservancies has been successful. There, the population is stable or increasing. However, many subpopulations of Flare-horned Markhor are still small (&lt; 100) and the level of connectivity between them is unknown. The major threat outside established conservancies is poaching.&#160;<br/><br/><br/><strong><em>Capra falconeri heptneri<br/><br/></em></strong>In Afghanistan, interviews suggested that within Markhor range overhunting is a considerable problem, with little capacity for enforcement of the national hunting ban (Moheb and Mostafawi 2011, 2012). As a result, Markhor appear to be under threat due to unsustainable hunting. (Moheb and Mostafawi 2011, 2012) Poaching in adjacent areas of Tajikistan is reported to threaten the source population of Markhor in Shahr-e Buzurg District (Moheb and Mostafawi 2011, Michel <em>et al. </em>2014).<br/><br/>In Tajikistan, Markhor are poached for meat. There are published reports of skins and horns of about 100 poached Markhor being detected in a camp of Afghan poachers in Tajikistan (Michel 2010). According to Moheb and Mostafawi (2011), hunters in northern Shahr-e Buzurg in Afghanistan told numerous stories of groups of hunters going to Tajikistan to poach, and they showed horns and two skins said to originate from there. Because of remoteness, logistical hurdles and lack of security, the international border in this area remains difficult to control.&#160; Cross-border poaching affects the security situation for game wardens, researchers, tourists, and legal foreign hunters and thus jeopardizes the conservation of Markhor in the Dashtijum Strict Nature Reserve and adjacent areas. A recent report (Alidodov <em>et al.</em> 2014) suggests that in some areas poaching is mainly targeted at mature males (including illegal trophy hunting, Vaisman <em>et al. </em>2014), and that there is a low proportion of adult males (4-5% of the total number, compared to above 20% in other areas). Habitat quality has deteriorated in some locations due to excessive and poorly regulated fuel wood cutting and intensive grazing.<br/><br/>In Turkmenistan, increasing grazing of goats and intense poaching threaten Markhor (Lukarevski 2002), whereas Weinberg <em>et al.</em> (1997b) reported that in 1995 grazing and illegal hunting seemed well controlled in Kugitang Strict Nature Reserve.<br/><br/>In Uzbekistan, Markhor are now largely restricted to the Surkhan State Strict Nature Reserve and its buffer zone. Despite their protected status, illegal cutting of trees and shrubs, livestock grazing, and poaching were reported (UNDP 2007). No specific information on the current status of these threats is available, but recent Markhor population data (Xoliqov 2013) suggest that the threats are controlled, at least to some extent.<br/><br/><br/><strong><em>Capra falconeri megaceros<br/><br/></em></strong>Valdez (2008) reported that in Afghanistan excessive hunting by local people and forage competition with livestock were pushing Markhor to the periphery of its range. Such severe pressure was leading the population to a slow demise, and its status is unlikely to have improved since.<br/><br/>In Pakistan, the most important threat to subpopulations outside the Torghar Conservancy is illegal hunting. Other threats include competition with livestock, risk of disease transmission from livestock (Woodford <em>et al.</em> 2004), habitat degradation, and habitat loss (Sheikh and Molur 2004). According to Hess <em>et al. </em>(1997), significant habitat loss was caused by logging in the Sulaiman Range, which they considered the most important area of straight-horned Markhor’s distribution. No recent data on the Markhor in the Sulaiman range are available and recent satellite images from 2011 and 2013 (Google Earth, accessed 2014) suggest that habitat conditions in the Sulaiman range are still largely suitable for Markhor.<br/><br/>Another threat for all Markhor subspecies may be posed by the spillover of contagious diseases from domestic goats and other livestock sharing Markhor habitat. Contagious Caprine Pleuropneumonia (CCPP), a contagious, lethal disease to caprids, perhaps overlooked for long time in the north of Pakistan, was recently confirmed to be present in domestic goats in Gilgit-Baltistan and south-western Tajikistan (Peyraud <em>et al.</em> 2014). <em>Mycoplasma capricolum</em> subsp. <em>capricolum</em>, an infectious bacterium hosted by domestic goats, killed at least 64 Markhor in fall 2010 in one area in Tajikistan (Ostrowski<em> et al</em>. 2011). In India diseases such as foot and mouth disease are reportedly common in livestock and can infect Markhor (Ranjitsinh<em> et al. </em>2007).<br/><br/>Hybridization with domestic goats may be a potential threat for all subspecies as goats commonly graze in Markhor habitats. Hammer <em>et al.</em> (2008) found introgressive hybridization with domestic goat among 35.7% of Markhor from three zoos, and speculated that in some cases introgressed wild living ancestral <em>C. falconeri</em> herds may have been the source populations of captive Markhor.</p>  <em></em>","The criteria for Red List Categories refer to mature individuals, but most available population data present total numbers. Here we referred to these total numbers; and for the assessment we assumed that 60% of each population estimate were mature individuals, defined as “the number of individuals known, estimated or inferred to be capable of reproduction” (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2014). In the case of Markhor, this definition excludes kids and yearlings.<br/><br/>The most recent data for most of the species’ range are from different time periods (2008–2014) and of variable quality, including information based on observations, estimates and educated guesses. Data from 2011-2013 are available for most areas, suggesting a total of about 8,800 Markhor. This number does not include some areas for which no data are available for that period. Based on older data and trends we assumed that in total approximately 900 Markhor existed in those areas, for a global population of about 9,700. We therefore assess the global population to be more than 5,800 mature individuals.<br/><br/><strong><em>Capra falconeri falconeri<br/></em></strong><br/>In Afghanistan, during a survey in April 1972, 37 Markhor were counted in the upper Alingar Valley, and numerous signs of presence and reports by local hunters were documented there and in the upper Alishang Valley, suggesting a viable population (Petocz 1972). In south central Nuristan Petocz and Larsson (1977) recorded 350 Markhor, but considered this number a small proportion of the local population. The observed sex-age structure indicated high reproduction and possibly a fairly stable population size or moderate decline despite hunting pressure. In contrast, in eastern Nuristan Petocz <em>et al</em>. (1977) found a dramatic decline caused by hunting. Camera surveys, hunter interviews, and participatory distribution mapping conducted by the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) in south central Nuristan during 2006-2007 and 2008 (WCS 2008, Stevens <em>et al</em>. 2011) suggested that the species was still present in the area surveyed by Petocz and Larsson (1977) and that the occupied range area was still largely the same. Although a 370 km transect survey by the WCS team recorded only three individuals, information obtained from local hunters and the importance of the species as main object of hunting indicated a population at least in the range of up to a few hundred animals.<br/><br/>In India, a survey of the species October 2004 to April 2005 in the Hirpura and Kajinag areas of the Pir Panjal Mountains in Jammu and Kashmir, recorded 35 Markhor groups, comprising 155 individuals (Ranjitsinh <em>et al</em>. 2005). This count, as well as interviews with key local informants, indicated that 350–375 Markhor may have existed in the surveyed area of Jammu and Kashmir. This is slightly higher than earlier numbers of 200–300 (Schaller 1977, Fox and Johnsingh 1997), probably because earlier reports were incomplete guesses based on information from only parts of the Kashmir Valley. The taxon’s range had contracted from about 300 km² in the late 1940s to about 120 km² in 2004–2005. (Bhatnagar <em>et al</em>. 2009)<br/><br/>For Pakistan, population numbers are available for various time periods and for different locations. Areas were surveyed during different seasons. The numbers we present are based on differing methods (counts, estimates, guesses), and names, locations and borders of specific sites are not always clearly defined. Most recent numbers are available for 2011 and 2012, suggesting a total number of about 4,500 Flare-horned Markhor. More than 1,500 occurred in Gilgit-Baltistan (WCS 2012), 2,959 in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (Iftikhar Uz Zaman pers. comm. 2014); and Arshad (2011) believed that in Azad Jammu and Kashmir approximately 50 Markhor existed. If these figures are correct, they indicate a substantial increase from the previous Red List assessment (Valdez 2008), when less than 2,500 to 3,000 Flare-horned Markhor were assumed to survive in Pakistan. Approximately 21 years before the current assessment (or about three generations), there were thought to be in total about 2,075-2,575 Flare-horned Markhor, including 1,075 in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (NWFP 1992) and 1,000-1,500 in Gilgit-Baltistan (NA Forest Department unpubl. information 1993, reported in Valdez 2008). Thus numbers in Gilgit-Baltistan may have remained stable or increased, while the population in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa appears to have increased substantially.<br/><br/>Schaller and Khan (1975) assumed a total of at least 5,250 Flare-horned Markhor living in Pakistan and in India. Petocz (1972) and Petocz and Larsson (1977) counted 387 animals in Afghanistan. The total population number of the subspecies at this time was thus about 5,650 Markhor (about 3,380 mature individuals). Available data suggest that during the period 1985-1993, the total number for the subspecies might have been around 2,950 (1,770 mature individuals). Arshad (2011) assessed the total population number for “Kashmir” Markhor alone at 1,800–2,000 individuals. An educated guess, combining data from different areas, suggests that as of 2012, the total population of <em>C. f. falconeri</em> was close to 5,000 (i.e., about 3,000 mature individuals). Hence the total population of this subspecies apparently decreased from the early 1970s to the early 1990s, but since then it appears to have recovered.<br/><br/>Data for specific locations in Pakistan show varying trends of population numbers:<ul><li>In 1970, the Chitral Gol, a valley of 77.5 km² in the Chitral District of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province (formerly NWFP), and at that time the private hunting reserve of the Mehtar of Chitral, was estimated to harbour 100 to 125 animals (Schaller and Mirza 1971). In 1984, this area was declared a National Park, and by 1985-86, it contained 160 (recorded) to 300 (estimated) animals. In addition, the proportion of males &gt; 4.5 years in the population increased during the same period (Hess 1986). Within this time span, Aleem (1979) recorded a maximum of 520 animals in Chitral Gol in 1979. The increase was attributed to better protection from poaching and to other improvement efforts in the Park (Malik 1985). However, according to Ahmad (unpubl. data, quoted in Valdez 2008), the population in Chitral Gol National Park was reduced to 195 Markhor in 1987. Estimates by Arshad (2011) showed an increase to 373 in 2003 and 590 in 2005/2006. Ali (2008) confirmed the positive trend leading to 612 Markhor recorded in 2006 with a computed annual growth rate of 7.7%. I. Uz Zaman (pers. comm. 2014) reported an increase of the estimated population in Chitral Gol National Park Wildlife Division (including Chitral Gol National Park and its buffer zone, Arshad pers. inf. 2014) from 1,146 in 2009 to 1,364 Markhor in 2012, a greater rate of growth than that suggested by a projection of the data presented by Ali (2008). The precision of these estimates cannot be assessed, as some earlier counts may have been biased low, and the area covered during different surveys might have changed and be thus not directly comparable. Nevertheless, these estimates suggest a substantial increase in the Chitral Gol National Park and adjacent areas.</li><li>For the Tushi Game Reserve (GR) in the Chitral District, Schaller and Khan (1975) estimated 125 animals, similar to the estimate in 1985-86 (anonymous 1986, Hess in press, quoted in Valdez 2008). In the Tushi Shasha Conservancy, Ali (2008) observed 137 Markhor in 1990 and 545 in 2006, from which he calculated an annual population growth of 7.9%. For the entire Chitral Wildlife Division (without Chitral Gol National Park Wildlife Division) I. Uz Zaman (pers. comm. 2014) reported an increase of the estimated population from 1,049 in 2009 to 1,456 Markhor in 2012.</li><li>The NWFP Forest Department (NWFP 1992) estimated 221 Markhor in Kohistan and 58 in Swat of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province. According to I. Uz Zaman (pers. comm. 2014) numbers recorded in Kohistan from 2009 to 2012 varied between 128 and 233, whereas recorded numbers in Swat decreased from 110 in 2010 to 11 in 2012.</li><li>The population of Markhor in the Kargah Wildlife Sanctuary (Gilgit District of Gilgit-Baltistan Province) was estimated by Roberts (1969) as not less than 500 to 600 animals; by Schaller and Khan (1975) as 50; by Rasool (no date, probably 1976, quoted in Valdez 2008) as 109; by Hess (1986) as 50 to 75; and by Rasool (unpubl. data, quoted in Valdez 2008) in 1991 as 40-50. In 2012 this population had reportedly recovered to 300 animals (WCS 2012).</li></ul><br/><br/><em>Capra falconeri heptneri</em><br/><strong><em><br/></em></strong>WCS staff surveyed parts of the potential range of <em>C. f. heptneri</em> in Northern Afghanistan in 2011. Due to security problems these surveys covered only small areas. The team observed four Markhor between Payan-e Moor and Aspakha Villages in the Kohe Ghaws area of Shahr-e Buzurg in Takhar Province. Local hunters believed that there were perhaps 20 Markhor left in this area. The interviews in Shahr-e Buzurg strongly supported the historical presence of Markhor in this district: 41 informants from northern and central Shahr-e Buzurg believed that Markhor were abundant in northern Shahr-e Buzurg during the 1970s. In the area between Dahan-e Ab Kof and Leiwgard Village in the Gandamargh Valley (Kuf Ab District in Darwaz, Badakhshan Province), the team observed six Markhor. Interviews with local hunters suggested that this area held approximately 80 Markhor (Moheb and Mostafawi 2011, 2012).<br/><br/>In the ex-Soviet republics, the total population was estimated to be about 1,000–1,200 animals in the 1970s (Zhirnov 1977), generally decreasing in the 1990s to about 700 animals (Weinberg <em>et al</em>. 1997a). However, Weinberg <em>et al</em>. (1997b), based on reports from game wardens and local inhabitants, believed the local population in Kugitang Strict Nature Reserve in eastern Turkmenistan increased during the mid-1990s.<br/><br/>Between 1960 and 1970, Zhirnov (1977) assumed that there were approximately 1,000 Markhor in Tajikistan, with the only viable population in the Kushvariston and Hazratishoh Mountains. In contrast, Sokov (1983, quoted in Baskin and Danell 2003) assumed that in 1967 only 500 remained in Tajikistan, decreasing to 400 by 1983. During the late 1980s in the Hazratishoh Range and in Kushvariston (Tajikistan) there were around 350 Markhor (Sokov 1989). Survey data from 2008-2012 (Michel et al. 2014) indicated that the subpopulation in the Hazratishoh and Darvaz Ranges of Tajikistan was stable and likely increasing, with a total of 1,018 recorded in 2012. A survey in 2014 recorded 1,300 in these areas (Alidodov <em>et al</em>. 2014) In the Sarsarak Range a separate population was rediscovered in 2014, with eight Markhor counted and about 30–40 reported by local hunters (K. Karimov pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>During surveys on the western (Turkmenistan) slopes of the Kugitang Range in 1995 and 2000, Weinberg et al. (1997b) and Lukarveski (2002) recorded 227 and 303 Markhor respectively. No recent information from Turkmenistan is available on the population number and trend of this subpopulation. Given the stable or slightly increasing numbers at the eastern (Uzbekistan) slope of the Kugitang Range, we assume that in Turkmenistan currently there are about 250 Markhor.<br/><br/>In the early 1980s there were 400 Markhor in Uzbekistan according to the Red Data Book of Uzbekistan (1983), but in 1994 there were only 270-290 estimated in Uzbekistan, with only 86 counted in the Surkhan Strict Nature Reserve (western slope of Kugitang Range) in May 1993 (Chernogaev et al. 1995). Survey data by the administration of Surkhan Strict Nature Reserve suggested an increase since a low in 2003 (140-150 recorded, 160–180 guessed), reaching its maximum at 310–313 animals in 2013 (Xoliqov 2013).<br/><br/>An educated guess, combining data from different areas, suggests that the recent (2011-2013) total population of <em>C. f. heptneri</em> was about 1,680 Markhor (1,008 mature individuals).<br/><br/><br/><strong><em>Capra falconeri megaceros</em></strong><br/><br/>In Afghanistan, few animals survived even in the late 1990s, perhaps 50-80 in the Kohe Safi region, with a few in other isolated pockets (Valdez 2008). No recent information is available on the population numbers of Straight-horned Markhor in Afghanistan. The subspecies may be extirpated in the country, but potentially Markhor from Pakistan (e.g., Torghar hills) may cross into Afghanistan.<br/><br/>In Pakistan, population numbers for Straight-horned Markhor are well documented for the Torghar Hills (Baluchistan). Roberts (1969) believed that the main concentration of the Straight-horned Markhor was in the Toba Kakar and Torghar hills and numbers could have been less than 500. In 1984, Tareen estimated that fewer than 200 Markhor remained in the Torghar Hills (Mitchell 1989, quoted in USFWS 2012). The estimate by Frisina (pers. comm. 2014) of 1,684 for 1999 represents a substantial increase compared to Johnson (1997) who estimated there were 695 Sulaiman Markhor in the Torghar Hills in 1994. Rosser et al. (2005) summarized results from surveys that suggested Markhor in the Torghar Hills had increased to over 1,600 by the year 2000. Arshad and Khan (2009) presented an estimate of 3,158 Markhor in Torghar in 2008. M. Frisina (pers. comm. 2014) considered this estimate possibly biased, and based on a new, conservative analysis of these data, suggested revising this estimate to 1,729. The most recent population estimate of 2,829 in 2011 is from M. Frisina (pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>There is no recent estimate for Straight-horned Markhor in other areas in Pakistan, but we assume there to be about 200 <em>C. f. megaceros</em> in other areas of Baluchistan and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. Schaller and Khan (1975) estimated 150 Straight-horned Markhor in the Takatu hills in 1971, but later Ahmad (1989) reported that only 50 still existed in these hills, and only 100 in the area of Koh-i-Sulaiman. In the Ziarat Mountains in Balochistan, Qadir Shah <em>et al</em>. (2010) recorded nine and Mazhar Liaqat (2013) counted 32 Straight-horned Markhor. The NWFP Forest Department (NWFP 1992) gave a total of only 24 animals for the whole province: 12 for the Mardan area, and 12 for the Sheikh Buddin National Park.<br/><br/>Although an accurate estimate of the total number of this subspecies is not possible, it can be assumed that with the population in the Torghar Hills estimated at 2,829 in 2011 (M. Frisina pers. comm. 2014) the total number might be slightly above 3,000 animals. In the 1990s this total was assumed to be around 870 (Ahmad 1989, NWFP 1992, Johnson 1997 quoted in Frisina and Tareeen 2009, Valdez 2008). Schaller and Khan (1975) estimated that more than 2,000 individuals remained throughout the entire range of Straight-horned Markhor in Pakistan. Roberts (1969) estimated that the total population of the former subspecies <em>C. f. jerdoni</em>, restricted mainly to the Province of Baluchistan, may have exceeded 1,000 animals, but that it was severely threatened because it survived in discontinuous and isolated pockets. For this same area, Schaller and Khan (1975) estimated fewer than 1,000 animals. Thus, over the past 20 years, numbers have recovered substantially, but this is known only for one area, the Torghar Hills.",Increasing,"<p>This species is found in northeastern Afghanistan, northern India (southwest Jammu and Kashmir), northern and central Pakistan, southern Tajikistan, southwestern Turkmenistan, and southern Uzbekistan (Grubb 2005). <br/> <br/> <em><strong>Capra falconeri falconeri</strong><br/><br/></em>Afghanistan: historically occurred in the eastern portion of the country, in the high mountainous, monsoon forests of Laghman (headwaters of Alingar and Alishang Rivers); Kunar and Nuristan (Habibi 1977, Petocz 1972, Petocz and Larsson 1977) and is still extant at least in south central Nuristan (WCS 2008, Stevens <em>et al.</em> 2011).<br/><br/>India: restricted to part of the Pir Panjal range in southwestern Jammu and Kashmir (Ranjitsinh <em>et al</em>. 2005, Bhatnagar <em>et al</em>. 2007, Bhatnagar <em>et al</em>. 2009). Populations are scattered throughout this range, starting from just east of the Banihal pass (50 km from the Chenab River) on the Jammu-Srinagar highway westward to the disputed border with Pakistan. Bhatnagar <em>et al.</em> 2009 observed Markhor only in Kajinag and Hirpura, and confirmed evidence of their occurrence in Boniyar and Poonch. In the areas of Shamsabari and Banihal Pass the taxon is likely extinct.<br/><br/>Pakistan: a&#160;detailed study on the past and present distribution of “Kashmir” Markhor by Arshad (2011) showed that the area of occupancy and the number of locations have declined greatly (approx. 70%) during the 20<sup>th</sup> century. However, historic ranges larger than present ranges are partly a result of too much generalization in the older distribution maps, which include large sections of unsuitable habitat. It is not clear to what extent exchange takes place between the often small groups of Markhor inhabiting different watersheds. Flare-horned Markhor are mainly confined to the Indus and its tributaries, as well as to the valleys of the Kunar (Chitral) river and its tributaries. According to Schaller and Khan (1975), along the Indus River, Markhor inhabited both banks from Jalkot (District Kohistan) upstream to near the Tungas village (District Baltistan), with Gakuch being its western limit on the Gilgit River, Chalt and (Haraspo) Sikandarabad on the Hunza River, and the Parishing Valley on the Astor River. Currently, Markhor are known from various locations in the Diamer, Astor, Gilgit and Baltistan Districts.&#160;Markhor are&#160;found along the Nagar Hunza River from Sikandarabad downstream, in Naltar Valley, along the Gilgit River downstream from Singul and along the Indus River downstream from Basho to the provincial border with Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (WCS, Mayoor Khan pers. comm. 2014). Markhor are known to be present in the Juglot Ghooro, Rahimabad and Haramosh valleys in Central Karakoram National Park (Athar A. Khan and Syed Yasir Abbas, Ecologist, Central Karakoram National Park, pers. comm. 2014). The population in Haramosh was considered extinct by Arshad (2011), but since winter 2011 Markhor have been observed there (Athar A. Khan and Syed Yasir Abbas, pers. comm. 2014), possibly indicating natural recolonization. The distribution range in Gilgit-Baltistan has been updated based on information from various sources (WCS, Mayoor Khan pers. comm. 2014). In Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Flare-horned Markhor were found around Chitral and the border areas with Afghanistan where it inhabited valleys along the Kunar River (Chitral District), from Arandu on the west bank and Drosh on the east bank, up to Shoghor along the Lutkho River, and as far as Barenis along the Mastuj River (Schaller and Khan 1975). The distribution range in Chitral has been updated based on Arshad (2011), and includes side valleys of the Indus River upstream from Dubair, the Shishi River Valley as well as the Chitral River Valley and its tributaries upstream from Chitral up to Kaghozi Gol (Mastuj River Valley) and Shogore (Lutkho River Valley).<br/><br/><br/><em><strong>Capra falconeri heptneri</strong><br/><br/></em>This subspecies previously occupied most of the mountains lying along the banks of the Upper Amu Darya and the Pyanj Rivers from Turkmenistan to Tajikistan. Currently, it is found in only two or three scattered populations&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">and its distribution has been greatly reduced&#160;(Weinberg <em>et al.</em> 1997). The subspecies was confirmed to occur as well in Afghanistan on the bank of the Pyanj River (Moheb and Mostafawi 2011, 2012).<br/><br/>Afghanistan: almost nothing was known of this subspecies or its distribution before 1979 (Habibi 1977). Reconnaissance surveys and interviews with villagers have shown that, across from the two strongholds of Markhor in Tajikistan, this subspecies exists but in very low numbers in the Darwaz Region (Kof Ab district, ~ 38°02’ N, 70°23’ E) of Badakhshan Province, and in Shahr-e Buzurg District and neighboring Chah Ab District of Takhar Province (~ 37°31’ N, 70°02’ E). The Markhor seem to cross the Pyanj River (which forms the border between Afghanistan and Tajikistan; Moheb and Mostafawi 2011, 2012).<br/><br/>Tajikistan: limited to the region along the Pyanj River east of Kulyab, southern Hazratishoh range (~ 70°05' E and 37°54' N), including the Kushvariston massif (~ 70°03' E, 37°35' N) and the Pasi Parvor mountains (~ 70°16' E, 37°44' N), and the eastern slope of the southwestern edge of the Darvaz range (~ 70°21' E, 38°05' N, Shuroabad&#160; district of Khatlon Region and Darvaz district of GBAO Region). Formerly markhor were reported from the Babatag Mountains (~ 68°03' E, 37°46' N) at the border with Uzbekistan (Ishunin 1972) and from the Sanglak and Sarsarak Ranges (southern parts of the Vakhsh Range, ~ 69°7' E, 38°13' N) (Abdusalyamov 1988). No recent reliable information suggests that Markhor still exist in the Babatag (Michel <em>et al.</em> 2014). The presence of Markhor in the Sarsarak Range was confirmed in 2014, but the species has been extirpated from the Sanglak Mountains (Khalil Karimov, Panthera, pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>Uzbekistan: found in the Kugitang Range (~ 66°36' E, 37°48' N) at the border with Turkmenistan. Its occurrence was reported in the middle of the 20<sup>th</sup> century from the Babatag Range (~ 68°03' E, 37°46' N) at the border with Tajikistan (Bogdanov 1992).<br/><br/>Turkmenistan: restricted to the western slope of the Kugitang Range (~ 66°31' E, 37°49' N), bordering Uzbekistan (~66°40’ E, 37°30’ N; Weinberg <em>et al.</em> 1997a).&#160;<br/><br/><br/><em><strong>Capra falconeri megaceros</strong><br/><br/></em>In Afghanistan, at least until 1978, this subspecies survived in the Kabul Gorge (Kabul Province) and the Kohe Safi area of Parwan Province, and possibly in some isolated pockets of Paktia Province. Intensive hunting pressure had forced it into the most inaccessible regions of its once wider range (Petocz <em>et al.</em> 1977, Valdez, 2008). No recent information is available on whether or not the subspecies is still extant in Afghanistan.<br/><br/>In Pakistan, the most comprehensive study of the distribution and status of the Straight-horned Markhor was published by Schaller and Khan (1975). The study showed a huge past range for this subspecies, but the actual range in Pakistan at that time consisted only of small isolated areas in Baluchistan Province, a small area in the former Northwest Frontier Province (NWFP), and one unconfirmed occurrence in Dera Ghazi Khan District (Punjab Province). Virk (1991) summarized the information for Baluchistan Province, and confirmed the subspecies’ presence in the area of the Koh-i-Sulaiman (Zhob District) and the Takatu hills (Quetta District), both according to Ahmad (1989). The presence of Straight-horned Markhor in the Torghar hills of the Toba Kakar range (Zhob District) has been repeatedly confirmed and it is possible that currently this area holds the only population consisting of more than 100 individuals of this subspecies (Tareen 1990, Frisina and Tareen 2009, Arshad and Khan 2009). Qadir Shah <em>et al. </em>(2010) and Mazhar Liaqat (2013) confirmed the presence of Straight-horned Markhor in the Ziarat Mountains in Ziarat District of Baluchistan Province. The NWFP Forest Department (NWFP 1987, 1992) considered that the areas of Mardan and Sheikh Buddin were still inhabited by the subspecies. There is no recent information about the Safed Koh range (Kurram and Khyber Districts) where, according to Schaller and Khan (1975) probably at least 100 animals lived on the Pakistan side of the border with Afghanistan in the early 1970s.</p>",See Use and Trade details under Threats.,Terrestrial,"<p>All subspecies and populations of <em>Capra falconeri</em> were uplisted from Appendix II to Appendix&#160;I of CITES in 1992. The 10<sup>th</sup> meeting of the Conference of Parties to CITES in 1997 passed a resolution (Conf. 10.15) allowing for an annual export quota of six Markhor trophies from Pakistan’s community-based hunting management areas to states parties to CITES. CITES increased the annual export quota to 12 in 2002, to further encourage community-based conservation (Resolution Conf. 10.15 (Rev. CoP 14)). The EU Scientific Review Group has expressed a positive opinion on the import of Markhor trophies from well-managed conservancies in Tajikistan (EU SRG 2014).<br/><br/>Within Afghanistan, the species was protected nominally in 2004 (WCS 2008) by a nationwide presidential decree banning hunting, but this ban was not generally enforced. In 2009 the species was listed on Afghanistan’s Protected Species List, making any hunting or trade within the country illegal. The species does not occur in any protected areas. Proposed conservation measures include:</p><p></p><ul><li>identify remaining populations, their distribution and numbers;</li><li>facilitate the development of community-based conservation in areas with extant populations or with potential for immigration of Markhor from neighboring countries and establish conservation incentives;</li><li>raise public awareness about the conservation importance of the country’s Markhor populations and potential benefits from their sustainable use;</li><li>develop trans-boundary collaboration between nature conservation authorities and community based initiatives, including the prevention of cross-border poaching (Petocz 1972; Petocz and Larsson 1977; Valdez 2008; Moheb and Mostafawi 2011, 2012; Michel <em>et al.</em> 2014). Urgent measures are required to conserve the straight-horned “Kabul” Markhor <em>C. f. megaceros</em> if still extant. Surveys to assess numbers and distribution are important. Local people’s support for its conservation is essential, but this will be difficult to obtain, as the initiation of community-based hunting management is currently not possible due to the hunting ban and the difficult security situation in the area.</li></ul><p></p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">In India, Markhor is a fully protected (Schedule I) species under Jammu and Kashmir’s Wildlife (Protection) Act of 1978 (Ganhar 1979). Currently, Markhor in India occur in only three small protected areas: the Limber Game Reserve, and the Lachipora and Hirapora Wildlife Sanctuaries. Conservation measures proposed include:</p><p></p><ul><li>raise awareness among the army, policy makers and local people about the rarity of the Markhor and the importance of the region for its conservation;</li><li>the largest Markhor population, in Kajinag, merits the establishment of a protected refuge and the state’s Wildlife Department has already initiated a move to set up the Kajinag National Park;</li><li>involve local people, especially nomadic herders and the armed forces, in the conservation of Markhor, including the realigning of grazing practices so that important areas of Markhor habitat are excluded from grazing, and as much as possible mitigating the larger impacts due to fencing and insurgency (Bhatnagar <em>et al.</em> 2009);</li><li>consider future re-introductions to previously inhabited ranges in the Pir Panjal mountains.</li></ul><p></p><p>    </p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">In Pakistan, the Markhor is completely protected by federal law (Rao 1986). In 1991, the Federal government imposed a 3-year ban on all big game hunting. This ban officially lapsed in 1993 but practically remained in effect, although it was ignored in the case of community-based trophy hunting programs (Shackleton 2001). The central government has issued permits only where a community-based trophy hunting program has been established; as of 2000, 80% of the permit fees were mandated to go to the community and 20% to provincial authorities in charge of nature conservation (although inter-community and provincial-federal disputes over receipts and permitting have occurred). The program continued through 2013 with trophy price for Markhor increasing from US $ 18,000 to about US $ 80,000-100,000. According to official records, between 1998 and 2008 approximately US $ 830,000 was distributed to communities within the former NWFP from hunter remittances from the 17 Markhor taken during this period (A. Khan unpublished data, NWFP Wildlife Management, 2008). With higher trophy fees during the last years, significantly higher contributions to the local communities have created substantial incentives for the conservation of Markhor in the participating conservancies. However, the small number of permits issued by the government (up to 12 per annum in accordance to the CITES export quota) may prevent an extension of the approach into still unmanaged areas.<br/></span><br/>In Pakistan several protected areas contain Flare-horned Markhor: Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa - Chitral District: Chitral Gol NP, Drosh Gol GR, Gahirat Gol GR, Goleem Gol GR, Goleen Gol GR, Purit Gol- Chinar Gol GR, Tushi GR (NWFP 1992); Swat District: Totalai GR (Zool. Survey Dept., 1987). Gilgit-Baltistan – Central Karakoram NP (in Hunza-Nagar, Gilgit and Skardu Districts) Gilgit District: Kargah WS, Naltar WS, Danyore GR, Sherqillah GR.

Azad Jammu and Kashmir - Muzaffarabad: Mauji CR, Qazi Nag GR, Hillan CR (Zool. Survey Dept. 1986); Poonch District: Phala GR (Qayyum 1986). Only one protected area is known to contain straight-horned markhor in Pakistan: Sheikh Buddin NP (previously a Wildlife Sanctuary) in Dera Ismail Khan District of NWFP (Zoological Survey Dept. 1987). The status of the subspecies in protected areas in Baluchistan is uncertain. Its occurrence is not confirmed in Chiltan-Hazarganji NP, and there is no reliable information for either Sasnamana or Ziarat Juniper WS’s. There are no reports of markhor in protected areas in Punjab.<br/><br/>The Torghar Conservation Project in Baluchistan has reduced poaching and competition by livestock (Johnson 1997; Frisina and Tareen 2009); the markhor population in this area is reported to have increased steadily since initiation of the program (Rosser <em>et al</em>. 2005, Frisina and Tareen 2009, Frisina, Montana State University, pers. comm. 2014). The TCP is the oldest community-controlled program in Pakistan and has been so successful that tribal groups in other mountain ranges of Baluchistan have expressed interest in setting up similar programs (Frisina and Tareen 2009, Ahmed <em>et al</em>. 2001).<br/><br/>Throughout Diamer, southern Gilgit, and Astore Districts of Gilgit-Baltistan community based conservation programs aimed at Markhor conservation have created over 40 community conservation organizations and 18 registered conservancies, and trained and deployed over 100 community rangers. Markhor are now well-protected and appear to be experiencing a significant recovery (WCS 2012).<br/><br/>Proposed conservation measures include:</p><p></p><ul><li>treat Kargah Wildlife Sanctuary as a focal area for Markhor and enforce protection measures. Kargah is probably the best place for Markhor in the Gilgit District, and like the Chitral Gol, should be rather easy to control because it is a traditional wildlife sanctuary and is close to Gilgit;</li><li>adopt a similar procedure for the area around Bagheecha in the Indus valley, which is one of the best places in Baltistan for Markhor and also relatively easy to control and to the Haramosh and Sikandarabad valleys (in Hunza-Nagar District) in the region of Central Karakoram National Park;</li><li>develop a conservation and management plans that includes information on the status and distribution of <em>C. f. megaceros</em> in the areas it still inhabits outside the Torghar conservancy; consider the area of Koh-e Sulaiman and the Takatu hills as a focal area for conservation efforts and include participatory management in the tribal areas in this plan;</li><li>retain the hunting ban (with its exception for approved community-based trophy hunts);</li><li>encourage the development of community-based hunting management areas in currently unmanaged areas and buffer zones of national parks, and consider a slight increase of the annual quota to ensure more equitable access to benefits from trophy hunts for all conservancies (with quota set on the basis of monitoring results).</li></ul><p></p>    <p><span lang=""EN-US"">In Tajikistan, Dashtijum Strict Nature Reserve (zapovednik) with an area of almost 20,000 ha was established in 1973, but since the early 1990s poaching has become common, and the security situation deteriorated due to incursions by Afghans (Michel 2010, Moheb and Mostafawi 2011). Markhor are legally protected, but hunting by foreigners was permitted (at least two Markhor/year) in the early 1990s (Weinberg<em> et al.</em> 1997). For the hunting season 2013-2014 the Government of Tajikistan issued a hunting quota of six Markhor, and five were taken by foreign hunters. Hunts are restricted to conservancies established and managed by local small family businesses and community based non-governmental organizations. About 80% of the Markhor recorded by the recent survey (Alidodov<em> et al. </em>2014) were in these conservancies. All captive Markhor in Dashtijum and Romit Strict Nature Reserves and the introduced animals in Romit were poached during civil unrest during the 1990s. </p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">Proposed conservation measures include:</span></p><p></p><ul><li>strengthening community-based conservation and management through secure rights and obligations for conservancies, issuing of area-specific hunting quotas based on survey results, issuing of import permits for hunting trophies and sharing of benefits with local communities;</li><li>prevention of assignment of hunting rights to non-locals and business structures and of illegal trophy hunts;</li><li>reducing poaching through trans-boundary collaboration, community-based hunting management and law enforcement;</li><li>reducing the risk of disease transmission from domestic sheep and goats by implementing grazing regulations minimizing direct and indirect transmission risks, monitoring the presence of infectious agents in domestic stock and implementing efficient vaccinations on domestic sheep and goats at least against CCPP and Peste des Petits Ruminant disease;</li><li>preservation of the quality of habitat through regulation of forest use and grazing.</li></ul><p></p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">In Turkmenistan the species is legally protected. Markhor occur in the Kugitang Strict Nature Reserve (zapovednik), established in 1986 and covering about 27,000 ha. Lukarevsky (2002) suggested that ecotourism and trophy hunting may provide incentives for the conservation of Markhor. Weinberg <em>et al</em>. (1997) suggested enlarging the Kugitang Strict Nature Reserve because it protects only the high elevation summer habitat of Markhor and the currently unprotected lower winter ranges are grazed by livestock. Critical for any consideration of a potential trophy hunting programme would be the full involvement of local community members and a benefit sharing mechanism which would ensure their support.<br/><br/>In Uzbekistan, trophy hunting of Markhor took place in the 1990s (e.g. two in 1994; Weinberg <em>et al. </em>1997) and until about 2005, including hunting in an enclosure containing a small captive group, which no longer exists (S. Zagrebin pers. comm. 2013). The EU Scientific Review Group in 2006 expressed a negative opinion on the import of Markhor trophies originating from the wild, which led to a suspension of trade in 2007. Markhor in Uzbekistan occur in the Surkhan Strict Nature Reserve (zapovednik). With assistance by a UNDP/GEF project during 2008-13 a managed buffer zone was established, encompassing all current Markhor habitat outside the strict nature reserve. Collaboration between the Kugitang (Turkmenistan) and Surkhan Strict Nature Reserves would be of utmost importance for the conservation management of this trans-boundary subpopulation.</p>  <em></em>",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Although there are no direct data available regarding recent declining population rates, the above-mentioned rate of decline seems reasonable based on the high levels of harvesting and habitat loss. It should also be noted that the population in China was guessed at over one million in the 1960s; in 1978-1980 at less than 600,000; and in 1992 at 100,000 to 200,000 in 1992 (Sheng 1998), though the basis for these numbers is not clear. However, if this level of decline is roughly correct, then the species might even qualify for listing as Critically Endangered under criterion A2cd. No new information was received in 2014 to enable a full re-assessment of this species.","This species inhabits coniferous or broad-leaved forests, or mixed forests and shrublands at high elevations (2,000-3,800 m asl). In Viet Nam it is found in karst habitats (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm.). Animals are most active between dusk and dawn, alternately resting and feeding. Forest Musk Deer eat leaves, grasses, moss, lichens, shoots and twigs. These animals are shy, sedentary and remain within a defined home range throughout the year. Males utilize their large musk gland to defend their territory and attract mates. When alarmed they make great leaps with wild changes of direction. They can adroitly jump into trees to forage. Their main predators include leopard, marten, fox, wolf, lynx and especially humans. Gestation lasts 6.5 months, after which one or two young are born. During the first two months, the young deer lie hidden in secluded areas, independent of their mothers except at feeding times. They are weaned within three to four months and reach sexual maturity by 24 months.  Animals may live up to 20 years. Home ranges of <em>M. berezovskii</em> were reported to be five to 10 hectares in China by Sheng and Liu (2007).","The musk produced by this genus of primitive deer is highly valued for its cosmetic and alleged pharmaceutical properties, and can fetch U.S. $45,000 per kilogram (2.2 pounds) on the international market. Although this musk, produced in a gland of the males, can be extracted from live animals, most ""musk-gatherers"" kill the animals to remove the entire sac, which yields only about 25 grams (1/40 of a kilogram) of a brown waxy substance. Such poaching is relatively easy to accomplish and difficult to stop using only legal means (Harris 2007). Musk Deer appear to require dense vegetation, either in the form of intact forests or shrublands; thus excessive forest clearing or grazing can preclude Musk Deer from using such lands (Yang <em>et al</em>. 2003). The Viet Namese population is heavily hunted by local people for medicinal use, and is thought to persist in the country in only four localities (Do Tuoc pers. comm.).","Estimating population size or trend for Musk Deer is very difficult, and has rarely been done satisfactorily. Population estimates over large-scale areas are subject to considerable uncertainty (and this is exacerbated in China by uncertainty over taxonomy). The population in China was guessed at over one million in the 1960s; in 1978-1980 at less than 600,000; and in 1992 at 100,000 to 200,000 in 1992 (Sheng 1998). However, the basis for these estimates is unclear, though the strong declining trend is likely to be correct.

(1)&#160;Red Panda diet is 98% bamboo. These plants&#160;show mass flowering followed by die off. Red Pandas will not readily find new feeding grounds in a highly fragmented landscape and are exposed to other threats when crossing unsuitable habitat. These bamboos do not easily re-establish after flowering in areas of environmental degradation and deforestation, which are now widespread across the&#160;species's range. (2)&#160;Red Pandas are highly susceptible to canine distemper (even developing the disease after vaccination with&#160;domestic dog vaccine), which is lethal to them. As more people, particularly herders, encroach Red Panda habitat, contact between domestic dogs (and their excreta) and Red Pandas increases. Unless all dogs (including feral ones) in Red Panda habitat are vaccinated against this disease the chance that it will enter and spread in the wild Red Panda population with catastrophic consequences are high. (3)&#160;Red Panda has specific habitat requirements for forest type, altitude, slope gradient and aspect, proximity to water courses, precipitation and presence of tree stumps. The gentle slopes and rich bamboo understorey of Red Panda habitat make it also a prime choice for herders with their dogs. Cattle also prefer these more gentle slopes, so trample bamboo, which is also collected extensively by herdsmen and used for fodder. In addition tree stumps are often collected by local villagers for firewood. (4)&#160;Hunting for trade seems to be increasing, Red Pandas are starting to enter the pet trade, perhaps partly in response to the increasing number of ‘cute’ images on social media. Deforestation and road building are easing access to Red Panda habitat. There are reports of poachers capturing Red Pandas in Nepal and Myanmar to satisfy the Chinese demand for the species (as wild meat, for medicine and for skins). The smaller population fragments, such as in&#160;Nepal, can support little or no off-take. (5)&#160;The human population in the Eastern Himalayas is growing at an average rate of 2.1% (doubling time 33 years). With this growth more people are moving into Red Panda habitat for their livelihoods, thereby exacerbating the above threats. Yonzon and Hunter (1991) showed that Red Panda mortality is high in disturbed areas; in their study area only three of the 12-13 cubs born survived to&#160;six&#160;months and only five of the nine adults survived the study period. They stated that 57% of these deaths were directly related to human causes. Comparable figures from undisturbed habitat are not available; but annual mortality rates such as these cannot possibly be&#160;sustainable.<br/><br/>The Ailuridae comprises a monospecific family. In part for this reason of conservation priority, with the evidence of precise decline rate being inadequate for certain discrimination between Vulnerable and Endangered, the precautionary course is taken of categorisation as Endangered, pending more precise information.","<p>Red Panda is closely associated with montane forests (oak mixed; mixed broad-leaf conifer; and conifer) with dense bamboo-thicket understorey (Roberts and Gittleman 1984). Conifer/fir forests seem to be preferred (Yonzon and Hunter 1991). Habitats above the tree-line are probably not consistently occupied given that Red Panda is essentially arboreal (Choudhury 2001). A dead Red Panda at 4,325 m asl in Arunachal Pradesh, in an area where the species is not generally known and far from any typical Red Panda habitat, was presumably a dispersant (Dorjee <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/> <br/> Six studies reported that Red Panda prefers to live near (typically within 100–200 m of) water (e.g., Pradhan <em>et al</em>. 2001). Five indicated a preference for canopy cover above 30%, with some suggesting cover as high as 70–80% may be preferred. Three suggested a preference for slopes of below 45%. Several indicated a preference for slope aspect: most suggest avoidance of south-facing slopes in favour of the cooler climate of the north, northwest and northeast aspects (Yonzon and Hunter 1991, Pradhan&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2001,&#160;Mahato 2004,&#160;Mallick 2010,&#160;Jhoshi and Sangam 2011,&#160;Subedi and Thapa 2011,&#160;Dorji <em>et al</em>. 2012, Panthi&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012, Zhou <em>et al</em>. 2013, Sharma&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). In the Sagamartha National Park, Red Panda was found on south-facing slopes in only one of six study areas, at lower density than at similar altitudes on north-facing slopes. In another area where both north- and south-facing slopes had otherwise similar habitat, Red Panda was found only on the north-facing slopes (Mahato 2004). Only in China have there been reports that Red Panda prefers south-facing slopes (e.g., Zhou <em>et al</em>. 2013). All studies investigating aspect took place in a similar altitude range. Also in China, in contrast to the rest of the range, steep slopes of more than 45% seemed preferred. Perhaps this relates to sympatry with Giant Panda <em>Ailuropoda melanoleuca</em>&#160;(in the Minshan, Qionglai, Liangshan, Daxiangling and Xiaoxiangling ranges in western Sichuan; Wei <em>et al</em>. 1999a, 2000), which uses the more gentle slopes. Zhang <em>et al</em>. (2008) found that Red Panda prefers microhabitats with higher densities of fallen logs and tree stumps.</p><p> Red Panda is largely vegetarian, eating chiefly young leaves and shoots of bamboo. It also takes fruit, roots, succulent grasses, acorns, lichens, birds' eggs and insects (Hodgson 1847, Sowerby 1932). It is largely arboreal (Hodgson 1847).<br/> <br/> Gestation in captivity lasts 114–145 days (Northrop and Czekala 2011), suggesting a variable delay in embryo implantation. The animals breed once per year giving birth in the summer (late May to early August in northern hemisphere zoos). In captivity, litter sizes range from one to four, most commonly one to two; quadruplets are exceedingly rare. In the field, Yonzon and Hunter (1991) reported litters usually of singletons or twins. The young are sexually mature at 18 months and females can give birth for the first time around their second birthday. In captivity the generation length is around five to six years and its average longevity around 12–14 years. This slow reproductive rate and relatively long generation time are typical of a k-selected species, adapted to a stable environment and less capable of survival when that environment starts changing rapidly.<br/> </p>","<p>Each of the three recent&#160;Population and Habitat Viability Analyses (PHVAs)&#160;listed the threats to Red Panda assessed to be most prevalent in their country/countries. Several problems occur throughout the species's range, albeit with some variation in assessed impact. The major threats are habitat loss and fragmentation; habitat degradation; and physical threats. These are all compounded by the region's increasing human population;<span class=""a1""> climate change; natural disasters; inadequate enforcement of laws and regulations; mostly low political will and interest; political instability (in some regions); low coordination of stakeholders, funding and human resources; trans-boundary issues facilitating poaching, illegal collection of non-timber forest products, and Red Panda trade (skins and other body parts); and the movement of cattle herders/grazers during the breeding season.<br/> <br/> <span class=""a1"">Natural disasters include cyclones; landslides; floods; heavy snowfall and rainfall; bamboo flowering (which results in death of the plant and typically occurs synchronously across large areas); forest fires; poor regeneration of shelter trees; weed infestation and invasive alien species; and disease outbreaks. Although most of these have been in operation throughout Red Panda existence, their effects are increasingly severe as an ever-larger proportion of the distribution is outside contiguous habitat blocks&#160;large enough&#160;for recolonisation to occur post-disaster.</span></p><p><span class=""a1""><span class=""a1""> In some areas, habitat is lost and degraded by commercial logging. In the Emaw Bum region of Myanmar more&#160;than 5,000 km<sup>2</sup> have been logged since 1999–2000, resulting in many new roads into mountain areas, e.g. between the May Hka river and the China border. These logging roads not only&#160;destroy&#160;habitat&#160;directly, they also facilitate access for hunters and can destabilise the substrate. A recent video report from FFI shows two young Red Pandas crossing a landslide, the result of foreign road-building in the area.<br/> <br/> As human populations grow, more people move into mountain regions to live. They clear land for habitation, bring domestic herds to roam in the forests where they trample and eat bamboo. Herders collect bamboo for fodder and other necessities. The herds are protected by dogs that attack pandas and, if not vaccinated, potentially carry canine distemper, fatal to Red Panda. The lack of annual vaccination in India, at least, leads to a high incidence of canine distemper in dogs of one to five years of age (Latha <em>et al</em>. 2007). Spillover of canine distemper into wild species is already well documented, such as to Indian Fox <em>Vulpes bengalensis</em> (Vanak <em>et al</em>. 2007) and Tiger <em>Panthera tigris</em>&#160;(e.g. Goodrich <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/> <br/> Himalayan bamboos, the Red Panda’s dietary staple, are sensitive to environmental degradation, deforestation, fire and overgrazing (Stapleton 1996). Reduced canopy cover increases wind and water stress for the bamboo. In these situations, seedlings are destroyed by the harsh conditions coupled with grazing pressure.<br/> <br/> Reports of Red Panda poaching and smuggling seem to be increasing, perhaps through demand in China.&#160;F. Momberg (pers. comm. 2010)&#160;saw Red Panda carcases and skins in&#160;villagers'&#160;homes in eastern Myanmar. One hunter allowed him to accompany him while he caught a Red Panda with his hands; apparently these villagers regularly take Red Pandas. Wildlife trade is rampant in Myanmar (about 30 tons of wildlife products per month), facilitated by wildlife habitat proximity to the Chinese border. Before Red Panda was upgraded to Appendix I of CITES in the early 1990s, individuals captured in Myanmar were traded by China to zoos around the world.&#160;<br/> <br/> Ang Phuri Sherpa (pers. comm. 2015) &#160;reported an increase in illegal trade over the preceding three years, based on the number of poachers and traders caught in Nepal. These incidents mostly involved skins and the items were headed for China. One incident involved a live Red Panda. A general increase in interest in Red Panda skins and meat in China could fuel more trade. A US businessman reported Red Pandas on offer in a restaurant. In the 'Threats' discussions during the 2012 Red Panda PHVA in China, many Chinese participants indicated that Red Panda meat was fairly widely available in restaurants, although no details are available. &#160;<br/> <br/> The live Red Panda trade, for pets, also seems to be increasing. Ian Lee (Chinese representative for Red Panda Network, pers. comm. 2015) found several reports in Chinese newspapers and social media of Red Pandas for sale as pets. This corroborates indications that Red Panda is increasing in popularity as a pet in China and other Asian countries, notably Thailand (YouTube videos and Instagram photos).<br/> <br/> Ngwe Lwin (pers. comm. 2014) considers hunting and poaching the major threat to the Red Panda in Myanmar, in two ways: in one area, Red Panda is not a target species but is caught in iron traps, and some of skins are traded; in another, live Red Pandas are traded to China, motivating local people to go to catch them whenever they have time.<br/> </span></p>","<p>Red Panda was “estimated to be more common in the eastern part of its range, especially along the Myanmar-Yunnan border, yet it cannot be considered a common species” (Roberts and Gittleman 1984). There have been four undertakings to estimate, per country, the area of occupied habitat and from this the approximate Red Panda population: Choudhury (2001), Mahato (2010), the recent Population and Habitat Viability Analyses (PHVAs; held in Nepal in 2010, China in 2012, and India in 2013) and Kendal <em>et al</em>. (2015). These show very little concordance (<span style="""">see Table 1 in the&#160;</span><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Supplementary Material</span>) and whilst some differences might reflect real change between earlier and later assessments, most must stem from differing assumptions and techniques. The PHVA figures are taken here as the most realistic guides, although none has been corrected for suitability of gross area of broadly suitable habitat accounting for specific preferences. Yet Red Panda is selective in forest used with regard to level of annual rainfall, percentage canopy cover, and density of bamboo (e.g., Yonzon <em>et al.</em>&#160;1991, Dorji <em>et al</em>. 2012, Zhou&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013). These would ideally all be taken into account when estimating area of potential habitat. In addition, Red Panda is usually found near water-courses and in areas with many tree stumps, and apparently prefers medium-gradient or shallower, north-facing slopes. In combination, these factors will make the area occupied at average to high densities substantially below that of potential habitat. For example, taking into account forest type, altitude, precipitation and slope aspect, Yonzon <em>et al. </em>(1991) estimated only 68 km<sup>2</sup> of the 1,719 km<sup>2</sup> Langtang National Park to comprise suitable Red Panda habitat.</p><p> Regardless of the uncertainty of actual area occupied, increases in human population and the continuing spread of human activity has driven habitat loss and degradation since the assessment of Choudhury (2001).<br/> <br/> <strong>Nepal</strong>. In the most recent Red List for Nepal (Jnawali <em>et al</em>. 2012), Red Panda is considered to be 'Endangered' under C2a(i), with numbers low (317–582 – similar to the prediction by Yonzon <em>et al.</em> 1997) and a declining population fragmented into 11 subpopulations. These data are extracted from the PHVA report. Subsequent surveys of Api Nampa (Arjun Thapa pers. comm. 2014) and Khaptad (Hari P. Sharma pers. comm. 2011) did not confirm the survival of these two subpopulations. The following estimates of density/numbers have been reported:&#160;<strong>Rara: </strong>about one animal per 3 km<sup>2</sup>, mostly between 3,100 and 3,600 m asl because of fragmentation and disturbance below this, and reduced habitat suitability above; a maximum of 11 Red Pandas in a 35&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;study area (Sharma 2008, Sharma <em>et al</em>. 2014). <strong>Langtang</strong>: one per 2.09&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;giving a total of 68 Red Pandas in the park (Yonzon 1989), but Yonzon <em>et al</em>. (1991)&#160;reassessed the Langtang population at 24. This apparent decline, of 65% in less than two to three years, was probably real, reflecting high mortality resulting from anthropogenic disturbance in the park. <strong>Panchthar – Ilam – Tapeljung:</strong>&#160;one per 5.5&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;– 100 animals in 178&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Williams 2003, 2004). <strong>Dhorpatan: </strong>animals present but no density or population estimates available<strong>.</strong> Most Red Pandas occur over 3,200–3,400 m asl (Subedi and Thapa 2011) or 3,000–3,800 m asl (Panthi <em>et al</em>. 2012), and suffer disturbance from local people for livestock and collection of forest products. <strong>Bhotkola:&#160;</strong>135&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;good Red Panda habitat holds about 30–46 Red Pandas (Joshi and Sangam 2011).<br/> <br/> <strong>India: the states of Sikkim, West Bengal and Arunachal Pradesh</strong>. Participants in the 2013 PHVA calculated that the amount of habitat available for Red Panda in Sikkim and Arunachal was 6,400&#160;km<sup>2</sup>. More rigid constraints on assessing habitat as 'suitable' gave merely 2,600&#160;km<sup>2</sup>. Even with the more relaxed habitat conditions, this area is only half that proposed for India by Choudhury (2001), although the comparison is complicated by the non-availability of 2013 figures for West Bengal. Given the changes in land use in the last 20 year, the area of potential Red Panda habitat has undoubtedly declined, although direct comparison between PHVA data and those published by Choudhury is unwise: Choudhury estimated Red Panda habitat from forest service maps and national park maps, whereas the PHVA evaluation used current satellite imagery. In Sikkim, 225–370 Red Pandas in 650&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;of suitable forest were calculated by Ziegler <em>et al</em>. (2010); the PHVA estimate was of 44–415. In West Bengal (<span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">not included in Table 1 in the Supplementary Material</span>), a statement of 78 Red Pandas in Singalila (Pradhan <em>et al</em>. 2001) contrasts with a more recent one of 27 animals (Roka and Jha 2014) and a similar number stated by Bahaguna <em>et al</em>. (1998). This figure plus the 28–32 animals stated to live in the Neora Valley by Mallick (2010) gives a total of 55–60 Red Pandas in West Bengal. In Arunachal Pradesh there have been fewer site-specific studies. This state is presumed to hold the largest Red Panda population in India. According to Choudhury (2001) it was relatively common in Tawang and northern West Kameng districts and in the Mishmi Hills, especially Dibang Valley and Lohit districts. Ghose and Dutta (2011) reported sightings of Red Pandas from&#160;several&#160;districts, all from before 2000. Habitat maps suggest that most Red Panda habitat is in the east of the state, with a second concentration in the west, around Tawang and Eaglesnest. The habitat between these two regions looks more sparse and fragmented.<br/> <br/> <strong>Bhutan.</strong> Red Panda seems to be widely distributed, mostly at 2,400–3,700 m asl. Bhutan is a very small country with a fast developing economy. The road system is expanding fast and the growing rural population depends on forest and forest products. Even in this country, the pressure on Red Panda habitat is marked.<br/> <br/> <strong>Myanmar</strong>. The area where Red Panda is found (northern Kachin province) is remote, with recent locality records from Hkakaborazi National Park, Hponkanrazi Wildlife Sanctuary, Mount Majed and Emaw Bum, mostly above 3,000 m asl. The number of villager captures suggests the species may be common in Hkakaborazi National Park, but none was camera-trapped there despite substantial effort at suitable altitude (Than Zaw <em>et al.</em> 2008). Ngwe Lwin (pers. comm. 2014) believes Red Panda is still fairly common in the Emaw Bum region, albeit much disturbed by logging and hunting. Red Panda is presumably less common than formerly in Myanmar and, although apparently not specifically targeted by hunters, it is still caught and killed.<br/> <br/> <strong>China. </strong>China is the only country for which the PHVA estimated much higher forest cover than did Choudhury (2001). Choudhury’s (2001) estimates were supported by Wei <em>et al</em>. (1999, 2011). As Wei <em>et al</em>. (2011) reported, reforested lands (which are increasing, reflecting government policy) do not provide suitable Red Panda habitat. Red Panda perhaps decreased in China by as much as 40% in the second half of the twentieth century, through massive habitat loss, increased human activity and poaching (Wei <em>et al.</em> 1999). Wei <em>et al.</em> (1999) estimated 3,000–7,000 Red Pandas in China.<br/> </p>",Decreasing,"<p>The current Red Panda distribution is detailed in three Population and Habitat Viability Analyses (PHVAs) since 2010, covering all range states holding the species: Nepal (2010), China and Myanmar (2012), and India and Bhutan (2013). As discussed by Roberts and Gittleman (1984),&#160;Red Panda&#160;distribution range should be considered disjunct, not continuous. Reports, including a shot animal of undoubted identification and provenance, of a population on the Meghalaya Plateau of northeastern India, in anomalously tropical habitat (Choudhury 2001, Duckworth 2011) warrant investigation as soon as possible. Captive&#160;Red Pandas from the main distribution and habitat do not breed well in tropical conditions (Princee and Glatston in prep); the Meghalaya Red Pandas, if native, might be a separate taxon.</p><p> In Nepal&#160;Red Panda&#160;has been reported from 23 districts, but a number lack confirmed specific records. A further district, Darchula, contains suitable habitat but so far lacks any Red Panda reports. The westernmost global reports are from the Api Nampa Conservation Area and Khaptad in far western Nepal (Jnawali&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012), but specific verifiable records there have not been traced since the 2010 PHVA,&#160;even though local people had affirmed Red Panda in these areas in the recent past. Two post-PHVA surveys failed to find the species in either area (H.P. Sharma pers. comm. 2011,&#160;A. Thapa pers. comm. 2014). The westernmost confirmed records are from Kalikot and Jumla at about 81°E (Dangol 2014); both are west of the formerly accepted range. In Bhutan it is found in 13 districts (Haa, Thimphu, Paro, Punakha, Wangdiphodrang, Gasa, Trongsa, Zhemgang, Bumthang, Mongar, Lhuntse, Trashigang and Trashiyangtse); high-elevation areas in other districts (Chukha, Tsirang, Dagana, Samtse and Samdrupjongkhar) require further surveys (Dorjii <em>et al. </em>2012). In India it is found in only three states: Sikkim, West Bengal and Arunachal Pradesh. In Myanmar it is known only from the northernmost state, Kachin, and is locally distributed even there (Than Zaw <em>et al</em>. 2008). In China it is found in three provinces, Sichuan, Yunnan and Tibet. Sichuan is its main homeland. In this province its range extends through the Minshan and Liangshan to Qionglai and the Lesser and Greater Xiangling mountains (Wei <em>et al</em>.1999, 2011). It is believed to be extinct in the rest of its historical range in China, e.g. Guizhou, Gansu, Shaanxi and Qinghai provinces (Wei <em>et al</em>. 1999). The Xiaoxiangling population appears isolated from the other <em>A. f. styani </em>population(s). It is a small population and represents a different genetic type that should be considered as a separate conservation unit (Hu <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/> <br/> Red Panda was&#160;stated to inhabit Lao PDR by Cheminaud (1942) and Deuve (1972). Re-examination of Cheminaud (1942) reveals many significant internal inconsistencies and flaws. Hence, there is no evidence that Red Panda has ever occurred in Lao PDR (Duckworth 2011).<br/> <br/> Red Panda occurs in a narrow altitude band. Roberts and Gittleman (1984) gave a range of 2,500–4,000 m asl. Prater (1948) mentioned occurrence down to 1,500 m asl and Choudhury (2001) gave a typical range of 1,500–4,800 m asl, up to nearly 5,000 m asl in the summer. However all recent publications, excepting those discussing animals from Meghalaya, support the Roberts and Gittleman range as that typically occupied, notwithstanding sporadic reports above 4,000 m asl and down to 2,300 m asl. The occupied altitude varies across the range. This might result from any of: disturbance at lower altitudes; time of year of assessment (several authors indicate that Red Pandas migrate seasonally up and down the mountainside; e.g., Yonzon and Hunter 1991); aspect (with animals occurring higher on the warmer south-facing slopes); and potentially other factors.<br/> </p>","Red Panda is taken for various purposes including wild meat, medicine, pelts and pets. Levels of offtake are not well documented; nor are trends in offtake or geographical patterns of harvest and use. It has been&#160;suggested that the rising numbers in the internet pet trade in China are captive-bred, but this remains&#160;to be confirmed.",Terrestrial,"<p>The Red Panda is included in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) Appendix I (www.cites.org). It is listed in Schedule I of the Indian Wild Life (Protection) Act 1972, the highest protection possible for a species in India (Choudhury 2001). It is also legally protected in Bhutan, China (where it is classed as a Category II species under the Wild Animal Protection Law; Wei <em>et al</em>. 1999a), Nepal (Glatston 1994) and Myanmar (by the Wildlife Act of 1994). In China, the species is Red Listed nationally as 'Vulnerable' under A2ace. In the most recent Red List for Nepal (Jnawali&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012), Red Panda is considered to be 'Endangered' under C2a(i),&#160;<br/> <br/> In Myanmar it is found in at least three protected areas: Hkakaborazi National Park, Hponkanrazi Wildlife Sanctuary and Emaw Bum proposed National Park. It is difficult to determine how much of the Red Panda’s range in the country these protected areas cover. Hunting and, in Emaw Bum, logging are widespread within their confines.<br/> <br/> In Bhutan it is found in the following protected areas: Jigme Dorji, Thrumshingla and Jigme Singye Wangchuck National Parks, Bumdeling and Sakteng Wildlife Sanctuaries, Toorsa Strict Nature Reserve, biological corridors connecting these reserves, and the biological corridor connecting Thrumshingla and Royal Manas National Parks. It has also been recorded in the Royal Botanical Park, Khaling Wildlife Sanctuary and Wangchuck Centennial Park (Dorji <em>et al</em>. 2012). Potential Red Panda habitat in the country modelled using MAXENT and ArcGIS 9.3 revealed 46% of predicted Red Panda habitat is under protected areas (PAs), 16% is in biological corridors and 38% lies outside the PA system. However, even protected areas are subject to activities such as road construction, livestock grazing, subsistence agriculture (slash-and-burn in some areas), collection of forest resources such as timber and NTFPs, and domestic dog presence.<br/> <br/> In India it is found in 19 protected or otherwise managed&#160;areas: Lachung Reserve Forest, Kanchendzonga National Park (NP), Barsey Rhododendron Sanctuary,&#160;the buffer and transition area of the latter two,&#160;Maenam Wildlife Sanctuary (WLS), Pangolakha WLS, Kyongnosla Alpine Sanctuary, Shingba Rhododendron Sanctuary, Singalila NP, Neora Valley NP, Kamlang WLS, Eaglesnest WLS, Zemithang Valley Community Forest, Nuranang Valley Community Forest, Mehao WLS, Mandla-Phudung CF, Anjaw Reserve forest, Mechuka-West Siang CF, Mouling NP and Dibang WLS. It might also inhabit Taley Valley WLS, Pakhui WLS and Sessa Orchid Sanctuary. These protected areas cover about one-third of the species’s total potential habitat in India (Choudhury 2001). In the 2013&#160;Population and Habitat Viability Analysis (PHVA)&#160;workshop, 22 protected areas (outside Meghalaya) were identified as having potential habitat for Red Panda, some with only very small areas. Furthermore, the workshop participants identified medium to high levels of threat in these areas from&#160;two or more of development activities; fire; herders; firewood and non-timber forest product collection; illegal trade/'accidental' hunting; dogs (very prevalent); refuse; and habitat reduction. In Arunachal Pradesh (the state believed to have the largest Red Panda population in India) around 60% of the forest is under community ownership rather than having PA status. Also in Sikkim, 60% of potential Red Panda habitat falls outside the PA system. Enforcement of protective legislation, especially outside protected areas, is almost non-existent (Choudhury 2001).</p><p> China has 46 protected areas containing Red Panda (Wei <em>et al.</em> 2011), covering about 65% of the species’s habitat in China. Poor law enforcement in PAs was listed as a problem during the 2012 PHVA workshop (Wei <em>et al</em>. 2014). Livestock grazing and collection of non-timber forest products occur widely in these areas.<br/> <br/> Red Panda has been confirmed in nine of Nepal’s PAs: Sagarmatha NP; Makalu Barun NP; Langtang NP; Rara NP; Kangchenjunga Conservation Area (CA); Annapurna CA; Gaurishankar CA; Manaslu Conservation Area; and Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve. In all these PAs, habitat loss and degradation, poaching and dog problems and developmental activities have been rated as moderate to severe by participants in the Red Panda PHVA workshop (Jnawali <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/> <br/> Currently there is a Global&#160;Species&#160;Management Plan (GSMP) for Red Pandas held in zoos around the world. This plan is closely allied to&#160;current field&#160;conservation efforts. The three PHVAs were largely the initiative of, and funded by, the zoo community. The aims of the GSMP are to contribute both directly and indirectly to Red Panda conservation by: providing a genetically and demographically sustainable and behaviourally competent back-up population for the wild population; holding the potential to supply individuals for genetic or demographic supplementation or reintroduction programmes; educating and the raising of public awareness of Red Panda, its uniqueness and conservation needs; and providing financial, technical, scientific and other support and expertise to the planning and implementation of <em>in situ</em> conservation and research &#160; <br/> <br/> Priority conservation actions fall into four main categories:<br/> <br/> 1. <u>To protect against habitat loss</u>: improve and manage Red Panda habitats (including within corridors); improve connectivity, including across international borders; balance developmental activities by promoting eco-friendly and sustainable development with minimal impact on Red Panda habitat; increase areas under protection; implement better Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) for all development programmes; engage political willingness and win support;  develop and implement landscape-level conservation policy, identifying unprotected Red Panda habitat and &#160;making legal provision for the declaration of Red Panda Community Conservation Areas.<br/> <br/> 2. <u>To reduce habitat degradation</u>: restore degraded habitats, plant bamboo; regulate tourism by the use of entry permits; zone PAs to define&#160;restricted-access zones in core areas for Red Pandas, facility  zones, and resource use zones, with restricted visitor access during the breeding season (set quotas for&#160;non-timber forest products); educate, sensitise, and promote community participation to reduce and mitigate threats to Red Panda and its habitat; promote the use of alternative energy and building materials; provide sustainable livelihoods; enhance range-land management, using native species; reduce livestock numbers, especially of&#160; unproductive breeds; develop an integrated agriculture, pasture and  agroforestry system; develop proper rubbish disposal systems; improve community stewardship in natural  resources management; improve fire-fighting, in part by training communities, developing a national fire fighting strategy, ensuring PA&#160;management plans include comprehensive coverage of forest fire (the implementation of a fire strategy including forest fire alert and monitoring system, forest fire mapping and zoning, provision of fire fighting equipment, and controlled burning to prevent fires).<br/> <br/> 3. <u>To reduce deaths of Red Pandas:</u>&#160;strengthen law enforcement and improve physical protection; enhance transboundary cooperation on both of the former; strengthen coordination/collaboration between  line agencies and other stakeholders; implement a reward and punishment system both for  communities and forest department; establish anti-poaching units (in community forests and PAs) with capacity building for front-line, anti-poaching staff; train customs officials; reintroduce captive-bred individuals to reinforce local populations; formulate a dog management plan to control, sterilise and vaccinate dogs; engage army personnel in border bases to keep their dogs in check and not let them roam free in Red Panda areas.</p><p> 4. <u>To improve awareness</u>: design and implement a dedicated awareness programme using radio, pamphlets, posters, and documentary film; secure adequate funding; improve conservation education (with a focus on Red Pandas) in schools; establish/strengthen Green Force Clubs; implement a Red Panda research programme, identifying priority research topics, and including regular monitoring of its habitat; develop a trans-national ‘Project Red Panda’.<br/> </p>",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

114251609,41687,Ursus americanus,Least Concern,,2016,2016-03-18 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>This species is widespread and occupies a large portion of its historical range. The global population is estimated at more than twice that of all other species of bears combined.&#160;Within the United States, populations have been expanding numerically and geographically.&#160;Legal hunting is the primary cause of mortality and is well controlled by state and provincial management agencies in the U.S. and Canada, respectively.&#160;Hunting is banned in Mexico.&#160;Population-level threats exist in only a few isolated places, and relate mainly to habitat fragmentation and conflicts between bears and people. Many management agencies are more concerned with controlling population growth of this species through legal harvest than promoting further growth and geographic expansion (which could increase human–bear conflicts).</p>","<p>American black bears are primarily a species of temperate and boreal forests, but they also range into subtropical areas of Florida and Mexico as well as into the subarctic. They live at elevations ranging from sea level to 3,500 m, and inhabit areas as diverse as dry Mexican deserts and scrub forests, Louisiana swamps, Alaskan rainforests, and Labrador tundra (where they occupy the typical niche of the grizzly bear; Veitch and Harrington 1996).&#160; Between these extremes they occupy assorted deciduous and coniferous forest types, each providing a different array of foods.<br/> <br/> The American black bear is a generalist, opportunist omnivore. Depending on location and season, they consume herbaceous vegetation, roots, buds, numerous kinds of fleshy fruits, nuts, insects in life stages from egg to adult, and vertebrates from fish to mammals, including their own kills as well as carrion.&#160; Moreover, they readily consume various human-related foods, from garbage and birdseed to a variety of agricultural products from cropfields and orchards, including corn, oats, soybeans, sunflowers, wheat, and apples, and brood and honey in apiaries.&#160; Black bear predation upon livestock has also been documented in some areas. The ability of black bears to adjust their diet to the circumstances has enabled them to persist not only in a diversity of habitat types, but also in highly fragmented forested areas in proximity to humans (Pelton 2003, Benson and Chamberlain 2006, Ditmer <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/> <br/> A key habitat feature in many areas is a source of fall mast that enables black bears to increase their fat reserves for winter hibernation.&#160; Historically, American chestnuts (<em>Castanea dentata</em>) likely were a key fall food for bears (and other wildlife) in eastern North America, but after a blight eliminated this food source in the early and mid-1900s, oak (<em>Quercus</em> spp.) acorns and beechnuts (<em>Fagus grandifolia</em>) have become the principal fall foods for bears throughout this region (Vaughan 2002).&#160; However, oaks are now declining in eastern North America due to forestry practices, insects, disease, and over-abundance of deer (McShea <em>et al. </em>2007), and a disease accidentally introduced in the late 1800s is now spreading widely across beech forests in northeastern U.S. (Morin <em>et al. </em>2007). In parts of the range where oaks and beech are absent or uncommon, hazelnuts (<em>Corylus</em> spp.), whitebark pine nuts (<em>Pinus albicaulis</em>), saw palmetto (<em>Serenoa repens</em>) berries, madrone (<em>Arbutus xalapensis</em>), manzanita (<em>Arctostaphylos</em> spp.), huckleberries (<em>Vaccinium </em>spp.), buffaloberries (<em>Shepherdia canadensis</em>), wild cherries (<em>Prunus </em>sp.), mountain ash (<em>Sorbus </em>spp.), or other fruits, or sometimes meat, are the fall dietary mainstays.&#160; In the southwestern U.S. and in Mexico, succulents such as yucca (<em>Yucca</em> spp.) and cactus fruits also play important roles in providing food, especially during drought (Doan-Crider 2003).&#160; American black bears may migrate considerable distances (up to 200 km) to find more abundant food sources, especially in late summer and fall, prior to hibernation (Garshelis and Pelton 1981, Beck 1991, Hellgren <em>et al. </em>2005, Noyce and Garshelis 2011).<br/> <br/> American black bears hibernate for up to 7 months in the northern portions of their range (Bertram and Vivion 2002, Chaulk <em>et al. </em>2005), but for considerably shorter periods in more southerly areas (Wooding and Hardisky 1992, Waller <em>et al. </em>2012).&#160; In some southern and low-elevation areas, where food is available year-round, some bears may remain active during winter (Hellgren and Vaughan 1987, Graber 1990, Doan-Crider and Hellgren 1996, Hightower <em>et al. </em>2002).&#160; However, all parturient females den to give birth to cubs, typically in January–February.&#160; American black bears use a wide variety of den structures: existing caves or tree cavities, underground chambers that they excavate, root masses, brush piles, or even above-ground nests. Adequate denning sites or structures are rarely thought to be limiting, except in habitats that flood (because young cubs may drown or die of exposure; White <em>et al.</em> 2001), or where bears preferentially choose certain types of dens, such as hollow trees, that are being reduced through logging (Davis <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/> <br/> Mating typically occurs in May–July, but may be extended in southern latitudes (Garshelis and Hellgren 1994, Spady <em>et al. </em>2007).&#160; Females can have as many as 3 estrous cycles (B. Durrant, personal communication, 2014). Implantation is delayed, and active gestation is only 2 months.&#160; Females give birth beginning at age 3–10 years: their rate of growth and maturity varies with food availability, and hence tends to be especially delayed in northern boreal forests.&#160; They can produce cubs every other year, but in places with less food, this interval may be extended to 3 years.&#160; Average litter size is approximately 2.5 cubs in eastern (ranging up to 5 or rarely 6 cubs) versus &lt;2.0 cubs in western North America (Alt 1989, Garshelis 1994, Bridges <em>et al. </em>2011).&#160; Reproductive rate in this species is highest among the ursids, although there is a clear dichotomy between Eastern (including Midwestern) and Western populations.</p>","<p>Throughout most of its range, this species is not threatened.&#160;Legal sport hunting is well controlled by state and provincial agencies to fit management objectives, and most states and provinces that harvest bears have a management plan (Hristienko and McDonald 2007).&#160;American black bears are harvested as a game species in all 12 Canadian provinces and territories where they exist and in 31 U.S. states.&#160;Since the early 2000s, 6 states with increasing bear populations opened bear hunting seasons ― Florida, New Jersey and Maryland, after 21-, 33- and 51-year closures, respectively, and Kentucky, Oklahoma, and Nevada for the first time in their management history. The sport harvest for this species in Canada and the U.S. totals 40,000–50,000 annually.&#160;Currently, black bears are not legally hunted in Mexico, but some conditional permits are allowed for depredation cases.<br/> <br/> A few small, isolated populations of American black bears may be threatened with extirpation, simply due to small population size, effects of fluctuating food (and in some cases water) resources, or direct human-caused mortality.&#160;A very small (&lt;20 black bears), isolated population in western Florida may persist only if tenuous travel corridors to other, more robust populations are made safer for bears (Larkin <em>et al. </em>2004). An isolated population on a peninsula in Ontario was judged to have a high probability of extirpation unless all non-natural mortality was eliminated (Howe <em>et al. </em>2007). A black bear population on a large island in Québec was extirpated apparently from introduced deer excessively browsing berry-producing shrubs, and thus eliminating an essential food supply for the resident bears (Côté 2005).<br/> <br/> Most small, isolated populations are in the southern U.S. In a particularly dramatic case, a severe drought in 2000 prompted a number of bears from Big Bend National Park, an isolated population in southwestern Texas, to travel to Chihuahua and Coahuila, Mexico, apparently in search of better fall mast — most never returned (they either remained in Mexico, died naturally when crossing the desert, or were killed by people).&#160;As a result, the entire Big Bend population was reduced to 5–7 bears, including only 2 adult females (Hellgren et al. 2005).&#160;However, since that time, this population has rebounded to higher numbers than were there before the exodus in 2000, likely supplemented by bears immigrating from Mexico. Mexico served as the original source of the recolonization of bears in southwest Texas after they had been eradicated during the 1940s (Onorato and Hellgren 2001). Movements by bears across the seemingly harsh, xeric environment of southwestern U.S. and Mexico once appeared to be anomalous (Doan-Crider and Hellgren 1996, Onorato <em>et al. </em>2004), but it is now recognized as an integral part of the ecology of bears in this region.&#160; In 2011, northern Mexico experienced record drought and wildfires that not only caused high direct bear mortality, but also prompted immigration of bears of both sexes into unburned, previously unoccupied habitat in both Mexico and Texas.<br/> <br/> Increased public awareness of bears and protection from human-caused mortality are likely enabling bears to successfully traverse areas of Mexico where they once would have been persecuted.&#160; Additionally, reports of bears using deer feeders on game ranches in northern Mexico and south Texas have become commonplace, and may be playing a role in promoting bear movements and population growth.&#160; Conversely, recently constructed barriers and human activity spurred by illegal human immigration and drug-related violence could thwart the natural interchange of bears across the U.S.–Mexican border (Atwood <em>et al.</em> 2011).<br/> <br/> Conflicts with humans have been a threat to black bears since European colonization of North America (Cardoza 1976). Human–bear conflict stems from humans and bears competing for space and bears being attracted to food items produced or managed by people. Due to their generalist food habits, black bears are readily attracted to many human sources of foods, such as garbage, agricultural crops, apiaries, and sometimes livestock, especially when their preferred wild foods are scarce. People kill bears in retribution, to prevent property damage, or in fear for their safety.&#160; Encounters between black bears and people have increased as people have encroached upon bear habitat, and as bear populations have increased and expanded into areas occupied by people.&#160; Most states and provinces with a significant population of black bears report common or increasing conflicts between bears and people (Hristienko and McDonald 2007, Spencer <em>et al. </em>2007).&#160; Recent studies suggest that variation in abundance of natural foods tends to be a key driver of human–bear conflict levels (Howe <em>et al. </em>2010, Obbard <em>et al.</em> 2014). Urban areas provide attractive sources of anthropogenic food for bears during periods of natural food shortages, but also are a source of increased mortality (Ryan <em>et al. </em>2007, Baruch-Mordo <em>et al. </em>2014). Urban areas are expected to increase across American black bear range in the future (Bierwagen <em>et al. </em>2010), which, coupled with the potential frequent natural food shortages in arid bear habitats as a result of global climate change, may threaten small or isolated bear populations.<br/> <br/> Increasing density of roads, with increasing traffic volume, is another growing threat to American black bears.&#160; Without immigration from an adjacent national forest, bear numbers in a rural residential community in north-central Florida would have declined as a result of increased adult female mortality from vehicle collisions (Hostetler <em>et al. </em>2007).&#160; A stretch of highway in North Carolina that was upgraded from 2-lane to 4-lane, with increased speed limits and a new alignment, caused increased bear mortalities that negatively affected the nearby population, even though underpasses were made available (van Manen <em>et al. </em>2012). Poor food years tend to spur wide-scale movements of black bears, resulting in increased mortalities from vehicular collisions (Wooding and Maddrey 1994).</p>","<p>Heavily persecuted since European settlement of North America, compounded by loss of forest cover, American black bear populations rapidly declined, and probably reached a nadir in the early 1900s. Greater state and provincial protection for bears enabled populations to slowly recover.&#160; More rapid growth occurred with increasing protective measures since the late 1980s (Williamson 2002).&#160; By 1999, 60% of U.S. and Canadian states and provinces reported increasing populations, and other jurisdictions appeared to be either stable or fluctuating with no clear trend (Garshelis and Hristienko 2006).&#160; Many of these trend assessments, though, were not derived from serial estimates of population size.<br/> <br/> Based on sums of estimates for individual states, the total U.S. population, excluding Alaska, is estimated at somewhat greater than 300,000.&#160; No reliable estimate exists for numbers of black bears in Alaska, although authorities presume there to be 100,000–200,000 animals.&#160; Similarly, large populations in most parts of Canada are not reliably known, but countrywide estimates center around 450,000 (principally in British Columbia, Ontario, and Québec).&#160;Thus, the total number of black bears in North America is likely within the range 850,000–950,000.&#160; No population estimates exist for the country of Mexico, although some areas within Mexico have high and increasing black bear densities (SEMARNAP 1999, Doan-Crider 2003).<br/> <br/> Many population size or density estimates have been derived using rigorous mark–recapture approaches.&#160;Densities have been reported as high as 155 independent black bears/100 km<sup>2</sup> (on an Alaskan island with legal hunting and abundant natural foods; Peacock <em>et al. </em>2011) and 214 independent bears/100 km<sup>2</sup> (coastal North Carolina with abundant agricultural crops consumed by bears; van Manen <em>et al. </em>2012) to as low as 5 independent bears/100 km<sup>2</sup> (interior Alaska; Miller <em>et al.&#160;</em>1997; and pine forest with little food or cover in coastal South Carolina; Drewry <em>et al. </em>2012).&#160; Some mark–recapture population estimates have been conducted over large geographic areas, encompassing whole states or provinces or numerous study sites across the state or province (e.g., Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, Ontario: Garshelis and Visser 1997, Garshelis and Noyce 2006, Dreher <em>et al.</em> 2007, Belant <em>et al. </em>2011, Howe <em>et al.</em> 2013, Lackey <em>et al. </em>2013).<br/> <br/> Population trend information is also commonly derived from mark–recapture or from population reconstruction or modelling using ages of legally-harvested bears (Fieberg et al. 2010).&#160; Population size and trend information are routinely used by management agencies to regulate harvest pressure and inform trends in human–bear conflicts.&#160; Detailed demographic studies have revealed that survival and recruitment of American black bears is closely tied to year-to-year variation in natural food abundance (Costello <em>et al. </em>2003, Reynolds-Hogland <em>et al. </em>2007, Obbard and Howe 2008, McCall <em>et al. </em>2013).<br/> <br/> Once portrayed as having one of the lowest rates of reproduction of any land mammal in North America, American black bears in some parts of the range, especially in the East and Midwest, are now known to have higher reproductive rates than previously reported (Hristienko and McDonald 2007).&#160; With controls on human-caused mortality, populations can increase rapidly, and spread through immigration. A black bear population in interior Alaska that was almost entirely removed to reduce predation on moose (<em>Alces alces</em>) completely recovered in 4–6 years by immigration (of both sexes) from the surrounding landscape (Keech <em>et al. </em>2014).</p>",Increasing,"<p>American black bears range across three countries: 12 provinces and territories of Canada (all except Prince Edward Island, where they were once abundant, but the last known one shot in 1927; Sobey 2007); 41 U.S. states (with sightings but undefined ranges in 5 other states); and 6 states of northern Mexico (Scheick and McCown 2014) (with sightings in 4 other Mexican states and a recent record of a dead bear farther south in the state of Hidalgo; Rojas-Martínez and Juárez-Casillas 2013). The species never existed outside of these three countries, although the southern historic limit is not well known. The present range falls within 69°29´ to 23°14´ N (with the incidental record in Hidalgo at 21°05’30” N) and 52°49´ to 164°10´W.<br/> <br/> In western parts of their range, American black bears broadly overlap and compete with grizzly/brown bears (<em>Ursus arctos</em>) (Mattson <em>et al</em>. 2005, Mowat <em>et al</em>. 2013). Black bears occupy several islands off the coast of Alaska and British Columbia, but do not coexist with brown bears on any islands.&#160; Northward, black bears narrowly overlap with polar bears (<em>Ursus maritimus</em>) along the Québec coast of Ungava peninsula, the Ontario and Québec coasts of James Bay, and along the Ontario and Manitoba coasts of Hudson Bay.&#160; Climate change seems to have enabled black bears to range farther north. For example, there have been recent sightings of black bears near Salluit, the second northernmost Inuit community in Québec (62°12'N) (S. Côté, Laval University, Québec City, personal communication, 2015).&#160; Along the western shore of Hudson Bay in Nunavut, local hunters from the community of Arviat (61°5'N) have observed black bears about 50 km west of the village.&#160; These sightings have occurred since 2005, were of single individuals, and are considered to be rare (D. Lee, Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated, personal communication, 2014) but are farther north than similarly rare excursions noted by Jonkel and Miller (1970).<br/> <br/> Loss of habitat and unregulated hunting/persecution resulted in extirpation of black bears across large portions of their range by the early 1900s.&#160; Present occupied range covers 10.5 million km<sup>2</sup>, representing 65–75% of the historical range, depending on whether Midwestern prairies are counted as historical range (Scheick and McCown 2014). &#160;Black bears were documented along some wooded river courses through the Great Plains (e.g., Lewis and Clark expedition, 1804–1806; Laliberte and Ripple 2003), but were likely scarce in the grasslands. More of the original distribution remains in Canada (&gt;95%; 6.9 million km<sup>2</sup>) than the U.S. (45–60%; 3.5 million km<sup>2</sup>). However, recolonization from growing neighboring populations, in some cases assisted by translocations, have occurred across the U.S., including several previously extirpated states: Rhode Island and Connecticut in the Northeast (Cardoza 1976, Scheick and McCown 2014), Kentucky in the Southeast (Unger <em>et al</em>. 2013), Ohio, Oklahoma and Missouri in the Midwest (Bales <em>et al</em>. 2005, Scheick and McCown 2014, Wilton <em>et al</em>. 2014; although genetic studies suggest that Missouri bears may not have been completely extirpated ― Faries et al. 2013, Puckett <em>et al</em>. 2014), and Texas (Onorato and Hellgren 2001) and Nevada in the Southwest (including areas that were erroneously thought to be outside historic range; Lackey<em> et al</em>. 2013). The current distribution in Mexico (at least 99,000 km<sup>2</sup>) is believed to have been drastically reduced from an unknown historical extent due to deforestation, hunting, and incidental killing from predator poisoning (Delfín-Alfonso <em>et al</em>. 2012); however, these bears are also now expanding and reoccupying portions of their former range, and possibly new areas because of artificial water and food sources.</p>","<p>A looming concern, but not a widespread problem in North America, is the poaching of bears for their paws and gall bladders, which may be sold commercially. Those products, particularly bile from gall bladders, are highly valued by practitioners of Traditional Chinese Medicine.&#160; Several U.S. states and Canadian provinces allow the sale of bear parts taken legally by hunters, either within that jurisdiction or transported into that jurisdiction from elsewhere (Williamson 2002). An argument can be made that this creates opportunities for poachers to employ an illicit pathway into the legal, commercial trade. However, illegal trade appears to be very limited.</p>",Terrestrial,"<p>n the U.S. and Canada, black bears are managed by individual states and provinces, so although an IUCN conservation action plan exists for this species (Pelton et al. 1999), each state and province sets their own goals and methods for achieving those goals.&#160; As a whole, this has worked well to re-establish robust populations of black bears across their range. Several key factors aided the rapid rebound of American black bears since the 1980s: (1) improved habitat, (2) large dispersal distances in high-quality habitat (Moore et al. 2014), (3) relatively high reproductive rates, (4) reduced human-caused mortality, and (5) better information about the biology and ecology of bears combined with better population monitoring techniques (Miller 1990).<br/> <br/> Much forested habitat, essential for black bears, was cleared indiscriminately for agriculture during the 1700s–mid-1900s, but has since returned in many parts of the U.S. Most notably, northeastern U.S. (New England) has been naturally reforested back to near its pre-colonial extent (~400 years ago; Hall <em>et al. </em>2002), although tree composition is different (fewer hard mast-producing trees as food for bears; Thompson <em>et al. </em>2013).&#160; Some states and provinces also manage habitat to benefit bears (e.g., space, foods, travelways, den sites; Pelton <em>et al. </em>1999).<br/> <br/> Through the 1800s and early 1900s in some areas, black bears were extensively hunted for meat, skins, and grease (i.e., market hunting; Smith <em>et al. </em>1991, Unger <em>et al. </em>2013) or hunted or poisoned with the intent of eliminating or severely reducing their numbers to reduce damage to crops and livestock (Cardoza 1976, Raybourne 1987).&#160; Governments often paid a bounty to encourage the killing of black bears.&#160; Protection and recovery occurred state-by-state and province-by-province during 1902–1983 as laws were changed and bears gained protection as a big game species (Miller 1990).&#160;Thereafter, the number and sex of bears killed were more closely controlled through hunting regulations and restrictions on numbers of hunters.&#160; By the 1980s, under the belief that black bears reproduced slowly and were easily over-harvested, most management agencies took a conservative approach to black bear hunting to enable populations to increase (Hristienko and McDonald 2007).&#160;Moreover, an infrastructure of wildlife management agency personnel and hunters policed illegal take.<br/> <br/> Wildlife management agencies have also taken an increasingly active role in reducing the number of bears killed in conflict situations through stricter laws against shooting and feeding (in some jurisdictions, feeding bears is illegal), and educational programs aimed at coexisting with bears by reducing attractants, promoting public tolerance, and recognizing that black bears are typically not a threat to human safety (Treves <em>et al. </em>2009, Baruch-Mordo <em>et al. </em>2014).<br/> <br/> In Mexico all hunting seasons for American black bears have been closed since 1985, and the species is considered nationally endangered.&#160;Numerous conservation initiatives established by large private ranches and land cooperatives in northern Mexico have created large blocks of suitable habitat (e.g., oak-dominated forests) with protection from poaching (Doan-Crider 2003).&#160;Changing public attitudes toward bears in Mexico have also contributed to the recovery and expansion of the species (SEMARNAP 1999, Onorato and Hellgren 2001). Although bear populations are clearly increasing, population estimation and monitoring efforts are lacking because funding (normally associated with hunting fees in the U.S. and Canada) is not available.&#160;Hunting bans will likely not be lifted without better documentation of population size and trend.<br/> <br/> In the southeastern U.S., where black bears now occupy 27–37% of their historic range (depending on whether primary range or total bear range are counted as occupied range; Scheick and McCown 2014), population recovery was aided by the establishment of national parks and other sanctuaries in the Appalachian Mountains and the Coastal Plain (Pelton and van Manen 1997).&#160;These large areas protect the habitat (especially mast-producing trees) and restrict hunter access.&#160;Beginning in the early 1970s, additional areas were established where bear hunting was prohibited, thus linking protected areas to other forested lands, including many private lands.&#160;the resulting conglomerates serve as dedicated or defacto sanctuaries, especially for adult females, that are a source for bears expanding into other areas (Beringer <em>et al. </em>1998, Unger <em>et al. </em>2013).<br/> <br/> In some areas, populations of American black bears have either been augmented or reintroduced after former extirpation by transplanting bears from elsewhere (Clark <em>et al. </em>2002).&#160; Reintroductions into Arkansas during the 1960s were highly successful (Smith <em>et al. </em>1991).&#160; Licensed hunters in this state now harvest several hundred bears annually, and bears from Arkansas have expanded into neighboring states. Further reintroductions within Arkansas have been conducted more recently (Wear <em>et al. </em>2005). A successful reintroduction augmented a newly-spawning population in Kentucky (Unger <em>et al. </em>2013). Augmentation of several populations in Louisiana during the mid-1960s likely contributed to population recovery there.<br/> <br/> The Louisiana black bear (<em>U. a. luteolus</em>), a recognized subspecies of American black bear, was listed as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act in 1992 as a result of severe loss and fragmentation of its habitat combined with unsustainable human-caused mortality (Bowker and Jacobson 1995).&#160;At the time of the listing, and since then, the validity and integrity of this subspecies has been debated (Pelton 1991, Kennedy <em>et al</em>. 2002, Csiki <em>et al. </em>2003, Puckett <em>et al. </em>2015). Under this ruling, all bears within the historic range of the Louisiana black bear, from east Texas to southern Mississippi, have been protected.&#160;Much of the bottomland hardwood forest that the Louisiana black bear historically inhabited had been converted to agriculture.&#160;Since 1992, remnant bottomland hardwoods have been protected, and some marginal farmland converted to hardwood trees.&#160; Moreover, a new population of bears within Louisiana was established by translocating bears from other Louisiana populations (Benson and Chamberlain 2007) in order to create a stepping-stone between two separated populations; this enabled bears to travel between them (Laufenberg and Clark 2014).&#160;One irony is that the stepping-stone successfully linked a population that was believed to be native Louisiana black bears with a population that had previously been established by translocating <em>U. a. americanus</em> bears from Minnesota (1964–1967). The Minnesota bears had clearly adapted to the very different habitat and weather conditions in Louisiana, as they have been established there for three generations and their numbers have been increasing.&#160;However, if the <em>luteolus</em> subspecies has any merit, the successful establishment of a conservation corridor reduced the purity of that genetic stock.<br/> <br/> The conservation efforts in Louisiana have been further enhanced through public information and education.&#160;This management program is organized by a broad coalition of state and federal agencies, conservation groups, forestry and agricultural industries, and private landowners.&#160;As a result, bears have been noticeably increasing in numbers and distribution in all three range states, although a breeding population does not yet exist in east Texas.&#160; Large, contiguous forested habitat capable of sustaining a population of black bears exists within the historical range of the subspecies in east Texas (Kaminski <em>et al. </em>2013); however, surveys of local people indicate concern over potential conflicts with an established bear population in the area (Morzillo <em>et al. </em>2010).&#160;In 2015, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed delisting the Louisiana black bear, based largely on a rigorous study (Laufenberg and Clark 2014) that showed that all of the population criteria for recovery had been attained and adequate safeguards against future threats were in place (Fuller 2015).<br/> <br/> Another typically-accepted subspecies of black bear (<em>U. a. floridanus</em>) was listed as threatened by the state of Florida in 1974, although legal hunting continued in some population strongholds until 1994.&#160;Habitat degradation, and bears being killed on highways and in conflicts with people are the primary threats to these bears. The fragmented habitat contributes to the high vehicle kills and human interactions. A public petition to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to list the Florida black bear as a federally threatened species was denied in 1992.&#160;A black bear management plan, adopted in 1993, directed the state management agency to conserve habitat and reduce human-caused bear mortalities. These efforts, particularly habitat conservation measures and changes in human attitudes toward bears, supported a steady population increase (Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission 2012).&#160;Florida black bears have been expanding into areas of unoccupied habitat as regrowth of understory and forests improve habitat quality, even as development reduces habitat quantity.&#160; In 2010 the status of the Florida black bear was re-evaluated using IUCN redlisting criteria, and after a thorough, peer-reviewed biological assessment and development of a management plan, the species was removed from the state’s threatened species list in 2012 (Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission 2012).&#160;A hunt was initiated in 2015.<br/> <br/> In British Columbia much conservation attention has been directed toward the Kermode subspecies <em>(U. a. kermodei</em>).&#160;This animal is commonly referred to as the “spirit bear” because it possesses a gene that when homozygous is manifested as white pelage (Ritland <em>et al. 2</em>001).&#160; White-phased animals have long been protected from hunting.&#160; A large system of protected areas was established in 2006 (Great Bear Rainforest Agreement) to ban or severely restrict logging within &gt;200,000 ha of coastal temperate rainforest inhabited by this subspecies of black bear, as well as by brown bears.&#160; Additionally, the spirit bear was selected as the official provincial mammal of British Columbia.<br/> <br/> Since 1992 all American black bears have been listed in Appendix II of CITES, under the similarity of appearance provision (Article II, para 2b).&#160; This listing stipulates that documentation of legal harvest is necessary for the import and export of body parts in order to prevent these from being confused as parts from illegally obtained bears.&#160; This listing was not designed to protect American black bears, but rather other species of threatened bears, particularly the Asiatic black bear (<em>U. thibetanus</em>), whose parts might otherwise be sold under the guise of being from American black bear.</p>",Nearctic,,false,false,Global

Country bear experts on the IUCN SSC Bear Specialist Group (representing all range countries except the Democratic People's Republic of Korea) estimated rates of population change for the past 30 years (three bear generations), and projected rates of change for the next 30 years (see Figure 2 in the attached Supplementary Material). These assessments were based on perceived levels of exploitation, loss and degradation of habitat, and changes in area of occupancy within their respective countries; no range countries have estimates of abundance or indices of abundance that are sufficient to document population trend. One country (Pakistan) obtained empirical estimates of a decline in occupancy of 33% in 30-40 years (Abbas <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/> <br/> Weighting each country’s estimate of population change by the country’s areal proportion of the geographic range yielded an overall estimated decline of 31% for the past 30 years.&#160; All countries that reported population declines also reported that these declines have not ceased. Thus, this species meets the criteria for Vulnerable. Projected decline was less (20-30%) for a 30-year window over-lapping the present, and for 30 years into the future.<br/> <br/> Estimates of population change for China have a very large influence on range-wide estimates because China comprises more than half the total range area. Forest area for China is increasing, but much of this reforestation is poor habitat for Asiatic Black Bears. Moreover, poaching levels are still reported to be high. Past trends in China were gleaned mainly from an extensive sign survey of occupied area combined with reports by local people in Sichuan Province, which is believed to harbour the largest numbers of Asiatic Black Bears. Projections into the future, though, are highly speculative, especially given uncertainty about future poaching pressure in China, which is largely motivated by bear bile, and may change with marketing of synthetically produced bile. Excluding China, the range-wide estimated rate of decline for the 30-year window including the present averages ~30%, and the projected rate for the next 30 years was 40%, indicating that the outlook for this species is getting worse in most of these other range countries.</p>","<p>Asiatic Black Bears occupy a variety of forested habitats, both broad-leaved and coniferous, from near sea level to an elevation of 4,300 m (in northeastern India and Sikkim; Sathyakumar and Choudhury 2007, Sathyakumar <em>et al. </em>2011). They also infrequently use open alpine meadows. A photo-capture was made in the alpine region of Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve, Uttarakhand, India at 4,500 m (&gt;1,000 m above the mean tree line; S. Sathyakumar, Wildlife Institute of India, pers. comm., 2014). In some areas of Nepal, local people have reported Asiatic Black Bears at higher than normal elevations, possibly a result of climate change (Aryal <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/> <br/> Individual bears move to different habitats and elevations seasonally (Izumiyama and Shiraishi 2004, Hwang <em>et al.</em> 2010), tracking changes in food abundance. In seasonal climates, foods include succulent vegetation (shoots, forbs and leaves) in spring, turning to insects and a variety of tree and shrub-borne fruits in summer, and hard mast (nuts) in autumn (Bromlei 1965, Reid <em>et al.</em> 1991, Hashimoto 2002, Hwang <em>et al.</em> 2002, Huygens <em>et al.</em> 2003, Koike 2010). In the tropics and subtropics, fruits are the mainstay year-round (Steinmetz <em>et al.</em> 2013). The diet may vary year to year with differences in food availability (Koike 2010), and this opportunistic species appears to be able to adapt its diet to gradually changing habitat conditions (Koike <em>et al.</em> 2013). In some places the diet includes a sizeable portion of meat from wild mammalian ungulates (which they either kill or scavenge, including tiger kills; Hwang <em>et al.</em> 2002, Seryodkin <em>et al</em>. 2005, Narita <em>et al.</em> 2006), livestock (Abbas <em>et al</em>. 2015), ants (which they may forage upon for 7-8 hours per day; Yamazaki <em>et al</em>. 2012), or bees (Hashimoto 2002).<br/> <br/> Asiatic Black Bears also use regenerating forests, which may have a high production of berries or young bamboo shoots (Takahata <em>et al.</em> 2014). They also feed in plantations, where they may damage trees by stripping the bark and eating cambium (Yamazaki 2003, Yamada and Fujioka 2010), and in cultivated areas, especially corn and oat fields and fruit orchards (Carr <em>et al.</em> 2002, Mizukami <em>et al.</em> 2005, Gong and Harris 2006, Abbas <em>et al.</em> 2015, Mukesh <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/> <br/> In southeastern Iran and Pakistan, this species occupies a very dry, sparsely-forested landscape (often called steppe forest or steppe woodland). This is the driest landscape inhabited by this species. Bears here use riparian areas, abandoned groves of date palm, and wild olive and pistachio forests (Ahmadzadeh <em>et al.</em> 2008, Ghadirian <em>et al.</em> 2012a). In some parts of this region, access to anthropogenic foods, particularly orchards (e.g., date palm, apricots, figs, walnuts), enable them to persist in a habitat with scarce natural food (Ghadirian 2012b). They use rock caves as shelters during daytime, and feed at night, possibly to avoid the sun or encounters with people in this very exposed habitat (Fahimi <em>et al.</em> 2011).&#160; By contrast, in more forested parts of the species’ range, they tend to be diurnally active (Hwang and Garshelis 2007) or crepuscular (Sharma <em>et al.</em> 2010).<br/> <br/> Asiatic Black Bears feed on a wide array of fleshy fruits and nuts. They were observed to feed on fruits from over 30 species of woody plants within a small, mountainous study site in Japan (Koike 2009). An equal dietary diversity was observed in a mountainous site in northern India (Sharma <em>et al. </em>2014). In tropical Thailand, dietary diversity was even greater: they were found to feed on fruits from least 30 families of trees (Steinmetz <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/> <br/> Fruiting tree density is a good predictor of the occurrence and relative density of Asiatic Black Bears (Ngoprasert <em>et al.</em> 2011, Steinmetz <em>et al.</em> 2011). In Thailand, these bears were noted to seek out rare fruits in the forest, possibly to diversify their diet (Steinmetz <em>et al.</em> 2013). Asiatic Black Bears are likely an important disperser of the seeds of some fleshy fruits (Sathyakumar and Viswanath 2003; Koike <em>et al.</em> 2008, 2010). They climb trees to eat fruits, and also eat fruits that drop to the ground. Sympatric Sun Bears also eat these same fruits. In Thailand, both species commonly feed on fruits in the cinnamon (Lauraceae) and pea (Fabaceae or Leguminosae) families.&#160; Both species live together in lowland habitats (&lt;1,200 m), but Asiatic black bears predominate at higher elevations (Steinmetz <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/> <br/> In temperate forests, Asiatic Black Bears rely heavily on hard mast in autumn, in part to attain sufficient fat reserves for winter denning (hibernation).&#160; Therefore, these bears tend to focus their activities in habitats with high abundance of oak acorns, beechnuts, walnuts, chestnuts, hazelnuts, or stone pine seeds (Schaller <em>et al</em>. 1989, Reid <em>et al</em>. 1991, Hwang <em>et al</em>. 2002, Hashimoto <em>et al</em>. 2003, Huygens <em>et al</em>. 2003). When Asiatic Black Bears feed in hard mast trees they often break branches and pile them up in the canopy, forming what appears to be a platform or “nest”. Males may socially exclude females, juvenile bears, and Sun Bars from rich stands of hard mast (Huygens and Hayashi 2001, Hwang <em>et</em> <em>al</em>. 2010, Steinmetz <em>et al</em>. 2011, Koike <em>et</em> <em>al.</em> 2012). When hard mast is poor, these bears expand their home ranges to find alternate fall foods (Hwang <em>et al</em>. 2010, Kozakai <em>et al</em>. 2011, Koike <em>et al</em>. 2012). In Japan, hard mast failures have led to massive intrusions of bears into residential areas, where they seek anthropogenic foods as a substitute (Oka <em>et al</em>. 2004, Oi and Furusawa 2008).<br/> <br/> In northern latitudes, where food becomes unavailable in winter, or in high altitudes covered by snow, both sexes hibernate. Therefore, Asiatic Black Bears hibernate throughout their range in Russia, Korea, Japan and northeastern China, and in high elevation areas of more southerly range states. Bears enter dens as early as October and as late as late-December; when hard mast is poor, den entry is earlier (Kozakai <em>et al</em>. 2013). They exit dens as early as mid-March to as late as the end of May (Seryodkin <em>et al</em>. 2003, Koike and Hazumi 2008). They den in rock crevices, hollow trees or stumps, under upturned trees, in dug-out earthen dens, natural cavities under roots, or in ground nests. In a mature natural forest in Japan, they were reported denning inside hollow trees, with entrances above ground level (Hazumi <em>et al</em>. 2001). In Russia, Asiatic Black Bears selected flat river bottoms for denning (Seryodkin <em>et al</em>. 2003), whereas in central China they moved to high elevation rocky outcrops on steep slopes (Reid <em>et al.</em> 1991).&#160; Likewise in Japan, dens tended to be in remote, difficult to access mountainous areas (Huygens <em>et al.</em> 2001, Koike and Hazumi 2008). Hunters often have knowledge of the sorts of places and types of dens that the bears tend to use, and have been reported finding and killing bears in dens. Denning and active Asiatic Black Bears are also subject to predation by other Asiatic Black Bears, Brown Bears, and Tigers (Seryodkin <em>et al</em>. 2005).<br/> <br/> Asiatic Black Bears do not hibernate from the Himalayan foothills southward where food is available all year and not covered by snow. However, pregnant females den throughout the range (even where food is available and other bears remain active) because they give birth to altricial cubs during the winter (Hwang and Garshelis 2007).<br/> <br/> Asiatic Black Bears generally breed during June-July and give birth during November-March; however, timing of reproduction is not known for all portions of the range. Age of first reproduction is typically 4-5 years old, and they normally produce litters of 1 or 2 cubs every other year (at most) (Yamanaka <em>et al</em>. 2011). Maximum lifespan is over 30 years, but average lifespan is less in the wild. No data are available on survival rates or causes of mortality.</p><p>                     </p><p>&#160;</p>","<p>Habitat loss due to logging, expansion of agriculture and plantations, roadway networks and dams, combined with hunting for skins, paws and especially gall bladders are the main threats to this species.<br/> <br/> Habitat loss due to logging and conversion to agriculture is a major threat to bears in 9 of 18 range countries, including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, and Russia. Of these countries, Myanmar stands out as it encompasses a relatively large portion (about 12%) of the global range, so habitat loss here will have a large impact on the global status of the species.<br/> <br/> Habitat loss and degradation is most severe in the southern portion of the range. In India, &lt;10% of the species’ range is within protected areas (PAs), and areas outside PAs are subject to development projects and extraction of wood for fuel and livestock fodder (Sathyakumar 2006, Sathyakumar <em>et al. </em>2012). In Bangladesh, where forest cover is now &lt;7% of the land area, Asiatic Black Bears survive only in small remnant patches in the east, generally near the Myanmar and Indian borders. Cambodia and Myanmar, although still well forested (57% and 48%, respectively), are third and fourth in the world in the annual rate of loss of forested area (among countries occupied by black bears; North Korea and Pakistan have higher rates: FAO 2010). Thailand has lower forest cover (&lt;30%), but most of its remaining forests are within PAs, and three-fourths of these are occupied by black bears (Kanchanasakha <em>et al</em>. 2010). Forest area has recently been increasing in Viet Nam, but much of the present remaining natural forest is highly degraded from both legal and illegal lumbering (Nguyen Xuan Dang 2006, FAO 2010).<br/> <br/> Forest area is increasing rapidly in China, which is now first in the world in terms of area gained per year. This increasing forest area stems from mandated government programs aimed mainly toward reducing flooding and erosion; the replanted trees may or may not be particularly suitable for bears. However, good forest habitat does persist in northeastern China, Taiwan, Korea, Russia, and Japan. In Japan, Asiatic Black Bear range has expanded with increasing forest area and diminishing rural human populations (Oi and Yamazaki 2006, Takahata <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/> <br/> Direct killing represents another potential threat. Local people in Nepal, for example, use meat, organs, and bile for food, for healing, to alleviate pain, or even to deter ghosts (Yadav <em>et al.</em> 2012). The sustainability of this practice has never been measured.<br/> <br/> Commercial poaching is believed to be a major threat to bears in at least half the range countries, including China, Taiwan, Russia, India, and the five range countries in Southeast Asia (Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam). Commercial poaching is likely to have especially severe synergistic effects where it coincides with logging and habitat encroachment (Cambodia, Myanmar, Lao, Russia), which increase access for poachers and concentrate bears in ever smaller and fragmented pockets.<br/> <br/> Poachers primarily seek gall bladders and paws. The market for bear paws appears to be increasing commensurate with an increasing number of wealthy people who find it within their means to indulge in this very expensive delicacy (Burgess <em>et al.</em> 2014). In 2013, two seizures in two months recovered parts of 81 individual Asiatic Black Bears being smuggled (from Russia) into or within China (Servheen 2013). Such seizures probably represent a small portion of the actual trade in bear paws.<br/> <br/> The demand for these bear products has fuelled a growing network of international trade throughout Southeast Asia, fed through poaching of wild bears (Shepherd and Nijman 2008, Foley <em>et al.</em> 2011). Though difficult to quantify because of its covert nature, bear poaching for the wildlife trade is clearly widespread. Hunting of bears for the wildlife trade was reported in over 70% (10 of 14) of the villages interviewed in a northeastern Lao National Protected Area, facilitated by wildlife dealers from Viet Nam who comb rural areas to place orders, supply weapons and ammunition, and transport the off-take (Scotson 2010). In parts of Nepal and Myanmar near the Chinese border, Asiatic Black Bears are among the top preferred species that are hunted commercially for sale of their body parts to China (Rao <em>et al.</em> 2005, Yadav 2012).<br/> <br/> It is difficult to evaluate the actual impacts of this trade on wild populations because reliable population estimates and assessments of trends of wild bear populations are unavailable (Garshelis 2002, 2006). Nevertheless, there is evidence that this commercially-driven trade in bear parts is unsustainable and therefore causing populations to decline. In Sichuan Province, which likely has the highest numbers of Asiatic Black Bears in China, bear abundance and distribution have been in steady decline according to opinions of local people, driven predominantly by illegal poaching for bear parts (Liu <em>et al.</em> 2009, 2011). Demand for wild bears drives poaching throughout Southeast Asia. Local inhabitants of a large Thai reserve perceived a 50% decline in Asiatic Black Bear abundance over the previous 20 years, due almost solely to commercial poaching (Steinmetz <em>et al.</em> 2006). Across four countries in Southeast Asia (Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Lao PDR), relative abundance of Asiatic Black Bears determined from camera trapping was half that of Sun Bears (with which they are widely sympatric) on average, indicating much lower densities (Steinmetz 2011). Notably, areas with the most depleted black bear populations are also closer to the Chinese border (Steinmetz 2011). The Asiatic Black Bear is the most highly valued species for consumers of bear parts, and seizures of bear parts in Southeast Asia are almost exclusively from Asiatic Black Bears (Shepherd and Nijman 2008).<br/> <br/> Use of cable snares to capture wildlife is widespread in Southeast Asia, and is particularly intensive in Viet Nam, Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Taiwan. In Lao PDR and Vietnam, 1,000s to 10,000s of snares have been removed from single protected areas within a few months (Scotson and Brocklehurst 2013; B. Robichaud, pers. comm). Intensive snaring poses a serious threat to bears because they are often caught inadvertently even if snares are targeted at other species. For example, 8 of 15 bears observed by researchers in Taiwan had missing toes or paws from snares set for wild pigs and other wildlife (Hwang <em>et al.</em> 2010). The recent discovery in Lao PDR of commercially-motivated snare lines designed specifically for bears (Scotson and Hunt 2012) points to increasing pressure on wild populations driven by international demand from the trade in bear parts.<br/> <br/> The capture of live bears presents yet another threat to this species. In several Southeast Asian countries Asiatic Black Bears are routinely confiscated from people attempting to raise them as pets, possibly originating from the poaching of their mother for the gall bladder and paws. In Pakistan, several thousand bears were taken from the wild for exhibitions (referred to as bear baiting) in which individual bears (with canines and claws removed) fight with dogs. This practice was made illegal in 2001, but continues to some extent surreptitiously. More commonly now, bears are used for “dancing”.<br/> <br/> Conflict between humans and black bears is a widespread problem that occurs across the range of the species: Iran (Ghadirian <em>et al.</em> 2012), Pakistan (Dar <em>et al.</em> 2009, Khan <em>et al.</em> 2012), India (Charoo <em>et al.</em> 2011, Choudhury 2013), Nepal (Stubblefield and Shrestha 2007), Bhutan (Sangay and Vernes 2008; Sonam Wangchuk, Wildlife Conservation Division, Bhutan, pers. comm., 2014), Lao PDR (Scotson <em>et al.</em> 2014), Thailand (Ngoprasert <em>et al.</em> 2011), China (Liu <em>et al.</em> 2011), and Japan (Kishimoto 2009). Human-bear conflicts have negative effects on both people and bears―they include losses to livestock, crops, and apiaries; human injuries and deaths; and killing of bears in defence or retribution. Crop raiding is often extensive especially where farm fields and orchards are close to forest, as in India, Bhutan, and Lao PDR, and large numbers of farmers have reported crop damage from black bears (Charoo <em>et al.</em> 2011, Rinzin <em>et al.</em> 2009, Scotson <em>et al.</em> 2014). Killing of Asiatic Black Bears in crop fields may be motivated more by the value of their parts than the protection of the crops (Liu <em>et al.</em> 2011, Yadav <em>et al.</em> 2012, Scotson <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/> <br/> Human injuries and deaths sometimes occur at tragically high rates, especially in densely settled areas with abundant bears: in Sikkim state, India, at least 25 people were killed or injured by black bears during 2008-2013 (Choudhury 2013). In Honshu, Japan, about 80 people are injured annually, including a few deaths (Japan Bear Network 2011). Such conflicts commonly give rise to negative attitudes towards black bears (Wang <em>et al.</em> 2006, Charoo <em>et al.</em> 2011, Liu <em>et al.</em> 2011, Sakurai and Jacobson 2011). Human-bear conflict can be a source of significant bear mortality when local people or government authorities kill bears to reduce damage; in an extreme case, over 4,000 bears were killed as pests in Japan in 2006 (Kishimoto 2009), representing a significant portion of the country’s population of black bears.<br/> <br/> Protected areas are often too small to contain resident black bears. Black bears have large home ranges (&gt;100 km² in some areas; Hwang <em>et al</em>. 2010, Chongsomchai 2013), and their wide-ranging movements may bring them near or beyond the borders of protected areas, where they are more vulnerable to poaching and more likely to come into conflict with farmers (Hwang <em>et al.</em> 2010, Ngoprasert <em>et al.</em> 2011, Choudhury 2013). The availability of natural foods also has a strong effect on whether bears roam outside protected areas. Periods of mast failure or low fruit availability can induce bears to seek human foods outside the forest (Kishimoto 2009, Ngoprasert <em>et al.</em> 2011). Black bear raiding of corn fields adjacent to a park in Thailand coincided with annual periods of low fruit availability, and resulted in some being killed by farmers (Ngoprasert <em>et al.</em> 2011).</p>","<p>The only rigorous population estimates for this species have been produced in Thailand, based on mark–recapture with camera traps, using distinctive chest patterns (Ngoprasert <em>et al </em>2010; Higashide <em>et al. </em>2012, 2013) to identify individual bears.&#160;This work yielded density estimates in three study sites in Khao Yai National Park, ranging from 8-29 bears per 100 km² (Ngoprasert <em>et al.</em> 2012, 2013).&#160;Bear sign density was found to be correlated with estimates of bear density, so sign surveys conducted across the country may, in the future, yield a reasonably reliable country-wide population index and trend information.<br/> <br/> In the Lower Dachigam area of Dachigam National Park and surrounding agricultural landscapes in Kashmir, India, genetic analysis of hair samples revealed the presence of 109 unique individuals in an area of 650 km², or17 bears per 100 km² (Mukesh <em>et al. </em>2015). Notably, this is a particularly food-rich area.<br/> <br/> Others have used a variety of ad hoc procedures to generate rough country-wide estimates. Largest populations occur in China (government estimate: ~28,000; Gong and Harris 2006), Japan (government estimate: 12,000-19,000, with much wider confidence intervals; Ministry of the Environment 2011), India (5,000-7,000; Sathyakumar and Choudhury 2007), and Russia (5,000-7,000; Aramilev 2006). Although these country-wide estimates are large, small, isolated populations also exist. For example, Japan has one large metapopulation as well as a few, disjunct small populations (Horino and Miura 2000, Yamamoto <em>et al.</em> 2012). Northern Pakistan may contain as many as nine separate populations (Abbas <em>et al. </em>2015). Thailand has a number of small populations inside protected areas, separated by expanses of agriculture (Kanchanasakha <em>et al. </em>2010).<br/> <br/> Countries with the smallest total numbers of Asiatic Black Bears are Iran (~100-200) and South Korea. Iran’s population has a relatively wide but disconnected distribution and occurs at very low density, due to the scarcity of suitable habitat.&#160;This population’s low genetic diversity and distinct genetic clade indicate that it has been small and disjunct for a long time (Yusefi 2013). South Korea’s population was nearly extirpated, but saved by a reintroduction program in Jirisan National Park, started in 2004 (Jeong <em>et al. </em>2011).&#160;All of the reintroduced animals were radio-collared, so their fate is known.&#160; It is believed that there were about 40 bears in the Republic of Korea population in 2015.<br/> <br/> Population trend has been deduced from sign, interviews, changes in habitat, and evidence of poaching.&#160;Republic of Korea and Japan report stable to increasing populations, Bhutan and Thailand report stable populations, and India reports stable to declining populations. All other countries report probable declining numbers (no report from Democratic People's Republic of Korea).&#160;The most severe declines, estimated at &gt;60% in the past 30 years, were reported in Viet Nam and Bangladesh. However, Asiatic Black Bears have fared better than Bangladesh’s other native bear species, which have been extirpated (Sloth Bears) or nearly extirpated (Sun Bears) due to severe habitat deterioration (Islam <em>et al.</em> 2013).&#160;Likewise, Sun Bears have disappeared from the only portion of their range in China (Yunnan province), whereas Asiatic Black Bears still remain there (Wen and Wang 2013).</p>",Decreasing,"<p>Fossil remains of the Asiatic Black Bear have been found in various sites in Europe, as far north as the Ural Mountains and Germany and west to France, dating from the early Pliocene to late Pleistocene (Erdbrink 1953, Kosintsev 2007, Baryshnikov and Zakharov 2013, Fourvel <em>et al</em>. 2014); however, in historic times the species has been limited to Asia. The western range limit is in southeastern Iran, inhabited by the so-called Baluchistan bear (<em>U. t.</em> <em>gedrosianus</em>) (Ahmadzadeh <em>et al. </em>2008, Ghadirian <em>et al. </em>2012). This small population is likely connected to the Baluchistan bear population in southern Pakistan. Disjunct populations of Asiatic Black Bears also occur in the more mountainous regions of northern Pakistan (Khan <em>et al. </em>2012) and Afghanistan (Ostrowski <em>et al. </em>2009). Eastward they continue within a narrow band along the foothills and south side of the Himalayas (up to treeline) across India, Nepal, and Bhutan, and then more widely distributed at lower elevations (generally &gt;70 m but occasionally to 20 m) in the hill states of northeastern India (Sathyakumar and Choudhury&#160;2007). They occur across mainland Southeast Asia, stretching south in Myanmar and Thailand to ~200 km north of the Malaysian border (Kanchanasakha <em>et al.</em> 2010); there are no records of Asiatic Black Bears ever existing in Malaysia. Over half the total range area of this species exists in China, especially in the south-central and southwestern parts of the country.&#160;This distribution includes portions of Tibet, from which the specific name, <em>thibetanus</em>, is derived. Smaller, remnant populations occur in eastern China. Another population cluster exists in northeastern China, the southern Russian Far East, and North Korea. A small isolated population exists in southern South Korea. They also live on the southern islands of Japan (Honshu and Shikoku) and on Taiwan and Hainan.&#160;Although they have been extirpated from large portions of their range, they remain in all 18 historic range countries.<br/> <br/> The distribution of the Asiatic Black Bear roughly coincides with forest distribution in southern and eastern Asia (FAO 2010), except that in central and southern India this species is replaced by the Sloth Bear (<em>Melursus ursinus</em>), in Malaysia it is replaced by the Sun Bear and north and west of the Russian Far East it is replaced by the Brown Bear (<em>Ursus arctos</em>). However, the Asiatic Black Bear overlaps the ranges of each of these species, especially the Sun Bear in a large portion of Southeast Asia and small portions of northeast India. It also greatly overlaps the range of Giant Pandas (<em>Ailuropoda melanoleuca</em>) in south-central China. In Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India, the Asiatic Black Bear range overlaps the Brown Bear (at elevations &gt;3,000 m) in the Himalayas (but curiously, does not appear to overlap Brown Bears in Nepal (A. Aryal, Massey University, New Zealand, pers. comm, 2016; Bista and Aryal 2013). It also overlaps Brown Bears in south-central and northeastern China, North Korea, and the Russian Far East. In India, Asiatic Black Bear range overlaps the Sloth Bear at low elevations (&lt;1,000 m) in some protected areas including Corbett Tiger Reserve and Rajaji National Parks, Uttarakhand (Bargali 2012). However, there is no evidence of overlap with Sloth Bears in neighbouring Nepal (Garshelis <em>et al. </em>1999). In North Karbi Anglong wildlife sanctuary in Assam, northeast India, Asiatic Black Bear range overlaps both Sloth Bears and Sun Bears—one of the few places in the world where all three of these species coexist, although all are reported to be rare (Choudhury 2011, Choudhury and Chand 2012).</p>","<p>Bear bile has been an important component of traditional medicine in Eastern Asia for millennia. The first written account of such use was recorded in the first pharmacopeia of China in 659 A.D. (Feng <em>et al. </em>2009). Bear bile is used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) for reducing fever and inflammation, detoxifying the liver, arresting convulsions, improving eyesight, and dissolving gall stones.<br/> <br/> The medicinally active ingredient of bear bile is ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). In controlled, clinical trials, this compound (and its associated conjugates) has been shown to have many of the medicinal properties claimed in TCM. In western societies it has been approved as a drug to treat certain liver diseases. More recently it has been shown to prevent retinal degeneration (Boatright <em>et al</em>. 2006), protect against Type I diabetes (Engin <em>et al. 2013</em>), and to have therapeutic effects for a number of neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and Huntington’s disease (Vang <em>et al. </em>2014).<br/> <br/> Despite the availability of synthesized UDCA, and the widespread use of this product in China, Japan, and South Korea, as well as a large number of herbal alternatives to bear bile in the Chinese pharmacopeia, many TCM practitioners (in Asia and elsewhere) prefer using bear bile because it is thought to be more effective and more natural than synthetic products. Some have claimed that other compounds in bear bile aid in the medicinal functions of UDCA, although no clinical trials have compared the efficacy of bear bile versus synthesized UDCA. Evidence suggests that UDCA in bear bile, which is a potent inhibitor of cell death (apoptosis), may serve to protect bears during hibernation (Solá <em>et al. </em>2006). Asiatic Black Bears produce high levels of UDCA. Historically, the Asiatic Black Bear has been sought after for its bile more than any other bear species. It is sold in various forms including whole gallbladders, raw bile, pills, powders, flakes, and ointments (Foley <em>et</em> <em>al. </em>2011).<br/> <br/> Increased demand, stemming from burgeoning human populations, coupled with more effective hunting of wild bears and increased ability to sell and transport products has led to the over-exploitation of many Asiatic Black Bear populations, especially in China and Southeast Asia. This trade was further fuelled by an increasing use of bear paws in a high-priced soup (having nothing to do with TCM; Burgess <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/> <br/> In the late 1970s, a technique was developed to extract bile from captive bears without killing them. This practice, called bear bile farming (or bear farming), started in Korea, then spread to China in 1984, and later to Vietnam, and most recently to Lao PDR and Myanmar. In Republic of Korea, Viet Nam, Lao PDR, and Myanmar, bear bile farming is technically illegal. In China, farmed bile is legally sold for use in TCM; it has been argued that this helps to satisfy public demand for bile while reducing the illegal hunting and sale of gall bladders of wild bears.<br/> <br/> Bear farming, though, has raised a number of concerns, both about animal welfare and conservation. In Viet Nam, many small-scale bile farms were stocked by thousands of cubs removed from the wild. The condition in which these bears were kept precluded successful breeding and cub rearing. Moreover, although this practice has been illegal since 1992, with regulations strengthened in 2002, the number of wild-caught farmed bears in Viet Nam continually increased, peaking at over 4,000, but declined by over 70% since the mid-2000s with stricter governmental efforts. In part as a result of the decline in farms in Viet Nam, farming operations sprang up in Lao PDR in 2000, and have been increasing rapidly (~120 bears by 2012; Livingstone and Shepherd 2016). Notably, prices of wild bear bile in Lao increased 180x from pre-farming years (1990s) to 2012, suggesting that the availability of farmed bile was actually enticing more users into the market, some of whom were willing to pay considerably more for the wild product (Livingstone and Shepherd 2016). As there is no evidence of breeding of farmed bears anywhere in Southeast Asia, the farms have a negative impact on wild populations both by taking cubs from the wild and by promoting more demand for products of wild bears.<br/> <br/> In China, it appears that many bear farms now have active breeding programs. It is unknown what degree of restocking occurs with cubs from the wild, but cases are still reported of people being apprehended with over 20 bear cubs apparently destined for a Chinese bear farm. The biggest unknown issue in China is whether the legal supply of bile has indeed reduced the demand for (illegal) wild bile, and hence reduced poaching of bears, or, as in Lao PDR, has stimulated more demand. <br/> <br/> For farming to reduce pressure on wild populations consumers must regard wild and farmed products as similar in quality or value—they must be substitutable (Phelps <em>et al.</em> 2013). In the case of bear bile, interview surveys in both China and Viet Nam show that many consumers regard wild bile as superior to farmed bile, are willing to pay higher prices for it, and are disinclined to use substitutes (Drury <em>et al.</em> 2008, Dutton <em>et al.</em> 2011). Further, the widespread availability of farmed bile may draw more people into the market via more prescriptions by TCM doctors and more promotions by the farming industry; some of these new users may be prompted to use wild bile for some illnesses, considering it to be more potent and pure. Farmed bile has also been promoted (via advertising) for non-medicinal uses, such as general well-being (administered in lotions, shampoos, cosmetics, tonics, etc.) or hangovers, although such uses are technically illegal. Because farmed bile is cheap, some people also use it recreationally (Vu 2010).<br/> <br/> Currently there are 67 registered bear farms in China, with an undisclosed number of bears (recently estimated at &gt;17,000). With China’s consent, the World Conservation Congress in 2012 approved an IUCN Recommendation (<a href=""https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/resrecfiles/WCC_2012_REC_139_EN.pdf"">WCC-2012-Rec-139-EN</a><a> Bear farming in Asia, with particular reference to the conservation of wild populations</a>) that (1) halts any increase in the number of farms and bears on farms, and (2) calls for a scientifically independent and peer-reviewed “situation analysis” to assess whether bear farming has a positive or negative effect (or no effect) on wild bear populations (Garshelis and Scotson 2012). Meanwhile, the recommendation adopted by the IUCN calls for the other four bear farming countries to phase out bear farming.<br/> <br/> All international trade in bile from Asiatic Black Bears, including farmed bile, is illegal under CITES. Despite this, a wide and complex network of international bear bile trading exists, which includes China, Republic of Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and all of the Asiatic black bear range countries in Southeast Asia (Foley <em>et al. </em>2011).</p>",Terrestrial,"<p>Protection of forested habitats would be an important conservation measure for this species. China, Thailand, and Viet Nam have imposed various sorts of logging bans, but with varying effects (Durst <em>et al.</em> 2001). In some cases this has resulted in trees being obtained (often illegally) from neighbouring countries, or in creating plantations which do not provide food resources for bears. However, in 2010 Russia banned the felling of Korean Pine, a key bear food source (I. Seryodkin, Russian Academy of Sciences, pers. comm. 2014).<br/> <br/> In most countries, closer government collaboration with local people and communities would help conserve natural forests. Community-managed forests have become increasingly important tools for conservation of large mammals in Asia: they can provide breeding habitat, create corridors that link isolated state managed protected areas, facilitate dispersal, and increase habitat that supports an overall larger number of animals. Community-managed forests in Nepal, for example, have created habitat that now holds breeding populations of one-horned rhinos and tigers (Gurung <em>et al</em>. 2008). These community-managed forests may provide similarly valuable habitat for bears, although this remains unexplored. The value of community-managed forests for bears should be investigated further, and expansion of community forest networks promoted where appropriate. The use of existing community-managed forests by bears should also be monitored, such as through sign surveys or camera trapping.<br/> <br/> The most beneficial conservation measure for Asiatic Black Bears would be to substantially lessen the demand for bear products, and thus reduce hunting and trade. Large scale, multifaceted, long-term campaigns are urgently required to change social norms regarding consumption of bear parts. Such campaigns are especially important in the main consumer nations of China and Viet Nam, and have indeed been initiated in both those countries by NGOs. As a result, public awareness of bear conservation issues has expanded greatly in the past 10 years in China and Vietnam and attitudes and behaviour are starting to change. In 2014 business leaders in China pledged to cease the practice of corporate gifting of wildlife products and committed to setting new trends for others to follow (TRAFFIC 2014).&#160; As of 2011 over 100,000 Vietnamese citizens had pledged to not consume bear bile, and a number of bear farms had closed due mainly to intensified social pressure (ENV 2012).<br/> <br/> The governments of Republic of Korea and Viet Nam are attempting to phase out bear bile farming. Conversely, bear bile farming is on the rise in Lao PDR and Myanmar, stocked by cubs from the wild. Authorities must recognize that these farms have become established due to loopholes in the laws and misreporting of the activities (Livingstone and Shepherd 2016). Meanwhile, China contends that farming must continue or poaching would increase; whereas no solid data are available to evaluate that view, it remains clear that poaching is still the primary threat, and that this will lessen only if the public demand for bile is reduced. Promotion of synthesized UDCA (or a product that includes UDCA as well as other bile compounds) is likely to be the best course for long-term reduction in demand for bear bile.<br/> <br/> The Asiatic Black Bear is protected under both international and national laws, but often these laws are not enforced. The Asiatic Black Bear has been included on CITES Appendix I since 1979. In most range countries Asiatic Black Bears are listed as a protected species. For example, they are protected under Class 2 of China's Wildlife Protection Law (a limited number of permits are issued to kill nuisance animals), and under Schedule I of the Indian Wild Life (Protection) Act. In South Korea they are designated as a national monument (No. 329) within the Cultural Properties Protection Law and also as an Endangered Wild Animal. In Japan, this species is listed under the Law for Conservation of Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, which for trade requires certification of legal take; however, gall bladders and paws are exempted.&#160; Throughout Southeast Asia this species is totally protected in every range country, with the exception of Myanmar, where it is classified as “normally protected”, meaning that it may be killed with a special license, although such licenses are rarely issued (Saw Htun, Wildlife Conservation Society, Myanmar, pers. comm., 2014). The Baluchistan subspecies was listed as Critically Endangered in the 1996 IUCN Red List, and is nationally listed as critically endangered in Pakistan and Iran.<br/> <br/> Despite these measures of protection, unabated poaching puts this species at risk across most of its range. Much greater efforts are needed to reduce poaching and snaring pressure, especially where populations are small or fragmented. This can be partly accomplished through anti-poaching patrols, which are typically conducted by trained reserve staff but may also include village volunteers. Such patrols are important for finding and physically removing snares, particularly in Lao PDR and Viet Nam where snaring pressure is intense (Scotson and Brocklehurst 2013). Another indispensable function of patrols is to assess and monitor hunting pressure, in order to gauge the effectiveness of conservation interventions. However, the ability of patrols to actually deter poaching and snaring from happening in the first place, while widely assumed, is little supported by empirical data (Steinmetz <em>et al.</em> 2014). Patrolling is particularly difficult in the remote, mountainous environments that serve as key, remnant habitats for this species. Additional approaches are required.<br/> <br/> Poaching could also be reduced by building conservation and co-management partnerships with local communities around parks and reserves, and by supporting community-based conservation in the absence of designated protected areas. Such approaches seek to build trust, raise awareness, provide motivation, support local resource management institutions, use local (as well as outside) knowledge, offer opportunities for action, boost confidence to act, and generate social pressure against poaching—behavioural change is promoted when these conditions converge. Such approaches have been demonstrated to reduce overall poaching pressure (Steinmetz <em>et al.</em> 2014) and increase tolerance for crop-raiding bears (Khan <em>et al.</em> 2012), improving the status of local bear populations (Khan <em>et al.</em> 2012; Steinmetz, unpublished data). Much more effort should be devoted to enhancing the involvement of local communities as conservation partners in protected areas where bears occur.<br/> <br/> Sport hunting of Asiatic Black Bears is legal only in Japan and Russia. Russia reports a legal harvest of 75-100 bears/year and an estimated illegal take of about 500 bears/year. Sport harvests of black bears in Japan average about 500/year and have been slowly declining since the late 1980s due to diminishing interest in hunting (Oi and Yamazaki 2006). However, a higher number (generally 1,000-2,000) of nuisance black bears are killed annually (using mainly traps) in towns or agricultural areas of Japan.<br/> <br/>The Republic of &#160;Korea has been partially successful in restoring their wild bear population through restocking, initially with captive-born bears, and later with orphaned wild bears from Russia (which are genetically similar to native Korean bears; Kim <em>et al.</em> 2011). These bears are now reproducing. Some Southeast Asian countries, like Cambodia and Thailand are also considering reintroducing bears from captivity, in part to augment wild populations, and in part to relieve pressures on captive facilities which cannot sustain the steady influx of confiscated animals.<br/> <br/> Throughout much of the southern portion of the range of this species, efforts to reduce habitat degradation outside PAs and to increase the number and/or area of PAs would be highly beneficial. An increasing number of PAs are being established in China, Russia, India, and a few other countries within the range of Asiatic black bears (Chape <em>et al.</em> 2008, Sathyakumar <em>et al</em>. 2012), mainly to protect other species, but serving as well to increase protection for black bears. Additionally, the recently amended (2003) Indian Wild Life (Protection) Act provides options for new categories of PAs that could be established to form travel corridors between existing PAs.<br/> <br/> More attention is needed on the issue of human-bear conflicts. A few recent studies have examined mitigation methods to reduce conflicts (Charoo <em>et al.</em> 2011, Scotson <em>et al.</em> 2014) and to create risk models to predict where conflicts are most likely to occur (Honda <em>et al.</em> 2009, Takahata <em>et al.</em> 2014). However, solutions to this issue remain largely elusive, because conflicts are in part due to varying food conditions in the wild, and in part to nearby availability of human food sources. Participation of local people in designing solutions and monitoring outcomes will be critical to success. Projects will probably need to be implemented for a number of years to produce useful outcomes; long-term funding will thus be needed to advance the science of human–bear conflict resolution. Where sufficient human resources and funding exist, conflict rapid-response teams (staffed by NGOs, government personnel, and local people) can be effective. Safety guidelines can be devised and disseminated, based on knowledge of bear behaviour and ecology in an area, to help people avoid bears or minimize chances of being attacked. Better methods to deter bears are also needed. Additionally, educational efforts to increase awareness and promote greater tolerance of some level of crop-raiding and livestock loss are likely to be key to success (Khan <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/> <br/> Aside from the global Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan for this species, published by the IUCN in 1999 (Servheen <em>et al.</em> 1999), which is incomplete and now quite outdated, two range countries, Taiwan and India, have developed National Conservation Action Plans for bears (Hwang <em>et al.</em> 2012, Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012). These are the first such conservation action plans for bears in Asia (although other countries have developed less extensive plans that aid conservation, as for example to deal with human-bear conflicts). Both of these country action plans were developed through a wide range of consultations with stakeholders. The Taiwanese plan concerns only Asiatic Black Bears, since this is the only bear species in the country (and also an endemic subspecies, <em>U. t. formosanus</em>). The Indian plan covers all four species present in that country: Asiatic Black Bears, Sloth Bears, Brown Bears, and Sun Bears. Both plans emphasize the same key themes: reduction in illegal hunting, mitigation of human–bear conflicts, increased habitat management, enhanced research and information gathering, capacity building, and improved communication and education.&#160; Both plans stress actions aimed against illegal hunting, including intelligence gathering, incentivized enforcement, community awareness, restriction of guns, and creation of a database to monitor trade. However, the root of the hunting issue is different in the two countries: in India hunters are motivated to sell bear parts, some of which are traded internationally, whereas in Taiwan bears are taken mainly opportunistically or as by-catch from illegal snaring for ungulates, and the parts (including meat) are used or sold locally (Hwang 2003). Other priority actions in the action plans include: strengthening methods of crop and livestock protection; reducing bear-caused human injuries (India), creating rapid response teams to investigate conflicts with bears (and possible claims for monetary compensation); enhancing human tolerance toward bears; identifying critical habitats and corridors used by bears, especially those outside PAs; increasing habitat protection and restoring degraded habitats outside PAs; reducing dependency of local communities on resources needed by bears; discouraging shifting agriculture; developing methods to track population size and trends; involving communities in bear monitoring programs; equipping forest and wildlife staff with adequate knowledge and modern equipment to manage all types of human-bear interactions; and developing an advocacy program for bear conservation through active communication to the public and pressure on corporations and politicians.</p>",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

115130419,15951,Panthera leo,Vulnerable,A2abcd,2016,2014-06-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>  </p>The Lion population is inferred to have undergone a reduction of approximately 43% over the past 21 years (approximately three Lion generations, 1993-2014).<br/><br/>We infer a decline of 43% based on time trend analysis of census data for 47 relatively well monitored Lion subpopulations. These subpopulations approximately totalled an estimated 7,500 Lions in 2014 and comprise a substantial portion of the total species population, so that we feel confident in applying observed trends to the species as a whole as well as on a regional basis.<br/><br/>The overall classification of the Lion as Vulnerable masks a dichotomy: we observe that sample Lion subpopulations increased by 12% in four southern African countries (Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe) and in India, while an observed decline of 60% in sample subpopulations outside these countries is inferred for the remainder of its African range. In other words, in the majority of its range the Lion meets the A2 criterion for Endangered with the inferred rate of decline over 50% in three generations, but this trend is numerically mitigated by a small number of subpopulations in a restricted geographical range.<br/><br/>This dichotomy is reflected in listings of the species in different Red Lists: in South Africa, the Lion will be categorized as Least Concern on the national Red List in preparation (Child <em>et al</em>. In prep.), whereas in India it is Endangered (as subspecies <em>P. l. persica</em> on the global IUCN Red List: Breitenmoser <em>et al</em>. 2008) and in the region of West Africa meets the criteria for Critically Endangered (Henschel <em>et al</em>. 2014, 2015).&#160; The range state list in Table 1 (attached Supporting Material) further illustrates the high threat levels across the species’ broad geographic range, as Lions have been recently extirpated in 12 African countries and we suspect possible recent extirpation in another four.<br/><br/>Among the causes of decline, the most important are indiscriminate killing in defence of human life and livestock, habitat loss, and prey base depletion. Prey base depletion is partly linked to habitat loss, but more importantly to poaching and bushmeat trade (Becker <em>et al</em>. 2013). An emerging threat is trade in bones and other body parts for traditional medicine, both within Africa and in Asia (IUCN 2006a, b; Riggio <em>et al</em>. 2013). Furthermore, although trophy hunting contributes positively to Lion conservation, improvements in management practices have been recommended (Lindsey <em>et al</em>. 2013b, Hunter <em>et al</em>. 2013, Edwards<em> et al</em>. 2014), as when poorly regulated, it also contributes to population declines (Packer <em>et al</em>. 2009, 2011; Croes <em>et al</em>. 2011, Rosenblatt <em>et al</em>. 2014). While attention is currently focused on Lion hunting reforms to ensure sustainability, the leading causes of population decline are more difficult to address and are likely to continue. The observed and inferred reductions are based on direct observation; appropriate indices of abundance; declines in area of occupancy, extent of occurrence and habitat quality; and actual and potential levels of exploitation.<br/><br/>Several subpopulations have been stable, among them the only remaining subpopulation in Asia (surviving in the Gir Forest area of Gujarat, India) and several subpopulations in southern Africa. Subpopulations appear to be stable where management is properly funded; fencing is one of several effective conservation management techniques (Packer <em>et al</em>. 2013). However, many Lion subpopulations occur in areas where management budgets are low, leading to local decline and even extinction, for example in West Africa (Henschel <em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160; Little is known about Lion subpopulations in Angola, Central African Republic and South Sudan, but we fear drastic declines especially for the latter two.<br/><br/>In conclusion, we assess the Lion as Vulnerable based on criterion A, more specifically A2abcd. Lion range and abundance exceed the Vulnerable thresholds for criteria B, C and D, respectively, so these criteria do not contribute to the present assessment, whilst criterion E was not applied. Vulnerable A2abcd is the same listing as the previous assessment but with a different underlying method. Previous assessments were based on a suspected decline of the total estimated number of Lions, which necessarily included low quality data. In the present assessment we did not use total Lion estimates, because we had a better alternative. We now have enough good quality data for a representative sub-set of Lion subpopulations to calculate an observed decline, from which we infer a decline for the species as a whole.<br/><p>  </p>","The Lion has a broad habitat tolerance, absent only from tropical rainforest and the interior of the Sahara desert (Nowell and Jackson 1996). There are records of Lion to elevations of more than 4,000 m in the Bale Mountains and on Kilimanjaro (West and Packer 2013). Although Lions drink regularly when water is available, they are capable of obtaining their moisture requirements from prey and even plants (such as the tsama melon in the Kalahari desert), and thus can survive in very arid environments. Medium- to large-sized ungulates (including antelopes, zebra and wildebeest) are the bulk of their prey, but Lions will take almost any animal, from rodents to a rhino. They also scavenge, displacing other predators (such as the Spotted Hyaena) from their kills.<br/><br/>Lions are the most social of the cats, with related females remaining together in prides, and related and unrelated males forming coalitions competing for tenure over prides. Average pride size (including males and females) is four to six adults; prides generally break into smaller groups when hunting. Lions tend to live at higher densities than most other felids, but with a wide variation from 1.5 adults per 100 km² in southern African semi-desert to 55/100 km² in parts of the Serengeti (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Pride ranges can vary widely even in the same region: e.g., from 266-4,532 km² in the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park of South Africa (Funston 2001).<br/><br/>In India, the habitat of the Asiatic Lion is dry deciduous forest. The Gir National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary is surrounded by cultivated areas and inhabited by the pastoralist Maldharis and their livestock (Meena <em>et al</em>. 2014). Domestic cattle have historically been a major part of the Asiatic Lion's diet, although the most common prey is the Chital Deer. Mean pride size, measured by the number of adult females, tends to be smaller than for African Lions: most Gir prides contain an average of two adult females (Nowell and Jackson 1996).","<p>The main threats to Lions are indiscriminate killing (primarily as a result of retaliatory or pre-emptive killing to protect human life and livestock) and prey base depletion. Habitat loss and conversion has led to a number of subpopulations becoming small and isolated (Bauer <em>et al.</em> 2008). Furthermore, trophy hunting has a net positive impact in a some areas, but may have at times contributed to population declines in Botswana, Namibia, Tanzania, Zimbabwe (Packer <em>et al</em>. 2009, 2011, 2013), Cameroon (Croes <em>et al.</em> 2011) and Zambia (Rosenblatt <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/><strong>Conflict</strong><br/>The economic impact of stock raiding can be significant: Patterson <em>et al</em>. (2004) estimated that each Lion costs ranchers in Kenya living alongside Tsavo East National Park US$290 per year in livestock losses. Likewise, annual losses of cattle to Lions in areas adjacent to Waza National Park in Cameroon comprised only about 3.1% of all livestock losses, but were estimated to represent more than 22% of financial losses amounting to about US$370 per owner (Bauer 2003). Consequently, Lions are persecuted intensely in livestock areas across Africa; their scavenging behaviour makes them particularly vulnerable to poisoned carcasses put out to eliminate predators. Little actual information exists on the number of Lions killed as problem animals by local people, even though this is considered the primary threat to their survival outside protected areas. Implementation of appropriate livestock management measures, coupled with problem animal control measures and mechanisms for compensating livestock losses, are some of the primary responses to resolving human-Lion conflict (Frank <em>et al</em>. 2006, Bauer <em>et al</em>. 2010, Hazzah <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/><strong>Prey depletion</strong><br/>Lion population density across the species’ range is known to track the biomass of principle Lion prey species; large wild herbivores (Van Orsdol <em>et al</em>. 1985, Hayward <em>et al</em>. 2007). The latter are increasingly under threat from an unsustainable and increasingly commercialized bushmeat trade, leading to collapses in prey populations across large parts of savanna Africa (Lindsey <em>et al</em>. 2013a). Regional Lion population trends reported in this assessment, are closely mirrored by time series data on main Lion prey species from 78 herbivore populations monitored between 1970 and 2005 in West, Eastern and Southern Africa; while herbivore population sizes increased by 24% in Southern Africa, they declined by 52% in Eastern Africa and by 85% in West Africa (Craigie <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/><strong>Use of Lion bones and body parts and derivatives for traditional medicine</strong><br/>Illegal trade in Lion body parts for medicinal purposes is considered a threat to African Lion subpopulations (according to the regional Lion conservation strategies, which call on countries to prohibit [IUCN 2006a] and control [IUCN 2006b] trade in Lion bone and other parts and products) as well as to the small subpopulation in India's Gir Forest (M. Ventraman pers. comm. 2014). In West and Central Africa, Sogbohossou (2006) found many reported uses for Lion skins and bone in Benin (with fat and bones being most commonly utilized: N'Diaye 2014), and a survey carried out around Nigeria's Yankari National Park found more than 22 Lion parts considered to be of medicinal value, with most of the over 200 interviewees saying they had used Lion parts in the past, and half within the past three years (Born Free Foundation 2008). The widespread prevalence of fakes in the traditional medicinal market is indicative of a continued demand. While fakes may replace items in the market that otherwise would be illegally sourced from the wild, they could perpetuate demand and poaching when consumers aspire to the genuine wild item rather than making a conscious choice of an (often cheaper) alternative (Nowell 2014).<br/><br/>There appears to be increasing interest in the use of African Lion bone in Asia. There is no history of Lion bone being used in traditional medicine there, but China has permitted the use of bones from captive Lions to make medicinal wines traditionally containing Tiger bone. South Africa has reported the export of large quantities of Lion bone sourced from captive animals to China, the Lao People's Democratic Republic and Viet Nam. Legal international trade in bone reported as from captive-bred Lions could serve as a cover for illegally wild-sourced Lion (and other big cat) parts (Nowell and Pevushina 2014). There is also concern that wild Lion parts from eastern and Southern Africa could be drawn into the large illegal wildlife trade to Asia centred around elephant ivory.<br/><br/><strong>Trophy hunting</strong><br/>Trophy hunting is carried out in a number of sub-Saharan African countries and is considered an important management tool for conserving wild land providing financial resource for Lion conservation for both governments and local communities. However, there is concern that management regimes have not always been sufficient to deter unsustainable offtakes (Packer <em>et al</em>. 2006). A sustainable offtake level of one male lion per 2,000 km² has been recommended (Packer <em>et al</em>. 2011), but offtake has been higher in many areas, which suggests that it is potentially a threat (Lindsey <em>et al</em>. 2013b). Trophy hunting can thus be a tool for conservation but also a threat, depending on how it is regulated and managed (Whitman <em>et al</em>. 2004, Loveridge <em>et al</em>. 2007, Packer <em>et al</em>. 2011). Hunter<em> et al</em>. (2013) cautioned that regulatory measures which reduce the profitability of Lion trophy hunting could have widespread negative impacts for wildlife-based land use, anti-poaching and tolerance of Lion outside protected areas.<br/><br/><strong>Other</strong><br/>Disease has also been a threat to Lion subpopulations (Munson <em>et al</em>. 2008, Trinkel <em>et al</em>. 2011). In parts of southeastern Tanzania there have been alarmingly high incidences of people killed by Lions, with up to 400 human Lion-related fatalities recorded from 1997-2007 (Ikanda and Packer 2007).<br/></p>","<p><strong>Population Trend</strong><br/>This assessment is based on a time trend analysis of census data from relatively well-studied Lion subpopulations (Packer <em>et al</em>. 2013, plus additional unpublished data provided by contributors). Census estimates were obtained by scientific research methods including total count, individual identifications, total or sample inventory using calling stations, radio telemetry, photo databases, spoor counts and density estimates based on direct observations corrected for patrol effort.&#160;These methods are rated as producing the most reliable type of Lion population estimates by background papers for the 2006 IUCN regional Lion workshops (Table 5 in Bauer <em>et al.</em> 2005a, b).&#160;We did not include population estimates for sites which were based on extrapolation of Lion densities obtained by research in other areas, or informed guesstimates by researchers. The minimum number of census surveys per site over the assessment time period is two, but some sites have been more regularly monitored (Table 3 - Data Points column, in Supplementary Material).&#160;In some cases census methodology varied between years, and for some surveys accuracy may have been low, but the complete data set shows an obvious trend that is unlikely to be an artefact of methodological insufficiencies.<br/><br/>IUCN Red List Criteria define three generations as the relevant time span for trend assessment. Lion Generation Length (GL) is based on the formulation of Pacifici <em>et al</em>. (2013):</p><p><br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; GL = R<sub>span</sub>*z +AFR</p><p>Where AFR = Age of first reproduction = 3.5 yrs (Packer&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1998)</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; R<sub>span</sub> = 15.5 (the age when 95% of females are no longer reproductive) - AFR = 12 yrs (Packer&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1998)</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Z = 0.29 (a constant “depending on survivorship and relative fecundity of young vs. old individuals in the population” (IUCN 2014), calculated as the slope of the linear regression between GL and Rspan for 221 mammalian species (Pacifici <em>et al</em>. 2013)</p><p>Thus GL = 12*0.29 +3.5 = 6.98 yrs<br/><br/>To fill gaps between censuses conducted in non-consecutive years, we interpolated population sizes, assuming a linear change between years. For surveys conducted for only a few years between 1993 and 2014, we extrapolated to the beginning and end points based on an exponential rate of change taken from the observed growth rate for each respective subpopulation. However, all extrapolations are capped by the estimated carrying capacity for each reserve so that subpopulations that experienced dramatic population change were not assumed to have been at implausibly high totals in either 1993 or 2014. Subpopulations were first categorized according to whether or not the reserves were surrounded by a fence; unfenced subpopulations were further categorized according to geographical location with the exception of Niassa Reserve (Mozambique), treated as an outlier as discussed below.<br/><br/>In graph form (Figures 1-4 in the Supplementary Material) we summarize the repeated censuses of 46 different African Lion subpopulations using all available repeat-survey data. Figure 5 (in the Supplementary Material) addresses the 47th Lion subpopulation in our analysis, the only Asian subpopulation.<br/><br/>Outside parts of southern Africa, Lions in 23 unfenced reserves in 11 countries are estimated to have dropped by 62% between 1993 and 2014 (see Figure 1 in the Supplementary Material).&#160; Although these totals only included about 4,600 Lions in the year 1993, several surveyed areas are restricted to the best-protected portions of much larger ecosystems (e.g., the phototourism areas of Selous and Serengeti).<br/><br/>In contrast, the total number of Lions in six unfenced reserves in Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe only declined by about 11% (Figure 2, Supplementary Material). Note that the overall stability in southern Africa masks considerable heterogeneity: between 1993 and 2014 the monitored Lion subpopulation in a portion of the Okavango ecosystem is estimated to have declined by 46%, whereas the much smaller subpopulations in Gonarezhou and Kunene have increased dramatically.<br/><br/>The striking contrast between these three countries in southern Africa and the rest of the continent is probably related to the equally striking differences in human population densities (Packer <em>et al</em>. 2013) in Namibia (2.5/km²), Botswana (3.4) and Zimbabwe (26) vs. Benin (78), Burkina Faso (57), Cameroon (40), Cote d’Ivoire (64), Ghana (102), Kenya (67), Nigeria (189), Rwanda (420), Senegal (68), Tanzania (48), Uganda (137) and Zambia (45).<br/><br/>The unfenced Niassa subpopulation is estimated to have increased by over 250% since 1993 (Figure 3, Supplementary Material); despite severe bushmeat poaching the Lions are still recovering from excessive prey depletion during civil war. In addition, on a shorter time scale, Lions have benefited from extensive ivory poaching, which has provided them with sizeable quantities of elephant meat (Colleen Begg pers. comm. 2014). Human population density in Mozambique is 74/km² with sizeable numbers of people living inside Niassa Reserve, so unless management is further strengthened, this unfenced Lion subpopulation may soon experience declining food supplies and increased human-lion conflicts. These arguments strongly suggest that the ‘boom’ in the Niassa Lion subpopulation has stopped and is unlikely to be repeated in the future. We therefore consider Niassa to be a special case and treat it as an outlier in our analyses, we believe that this offers a better understanding of trends, but we note that this does not alter the assessment (with Niassa included, the assessment would still be Vulnerable A2abcd).<br/><br/>The 16 fenced African subpopulations (10 in South Africa, and all but one in southern Africa) have grown by 29% since 1993, most having already reached their presumed carrying capacities by 2013 (Figure 4, Supplementary Material). Note that although these numbers now total over 3,226 lions, our data come from the great majority of fenced reserves in Africa and that little further growth can be expected in these subpopulations.<br/><br/>Asia is home to a single contiguous subpopulation in the Indian state of Gujarat (Figure 5, Supplementary Material). While the population has stabilized inside the Gir Reserve, the so-called “satellite” population in the surrounding countryside has expanded by ~400% in the past 21 years.<br/><br/>The 47 sample Lion subpopulations totalled an estimated 9,615 lions in 1993 (excluding Niassa, which is treated as an outlier as described above); that number shrank by 22% to 7,455 lions in 2014 (Table 2, Supplementary Material).&#160; However, as described above, there are significant regional differences evident in population trend, and we use these to inform our inferences about population trend for the species as a whole. Table 2 (Supplementary Material) groups the sample subpopulations by region in Africa, following the IUCN (2006a, b) regional Lion conservation strategies, but combining West and Central Africa due to a small sample size for Central Africa.&#160; In Southern Africa, the sample population grew by 8%, while in sharp contrast, sample populations declined by 59% in Eastern Africa and 66% in West and Central Africa.<br/><br/>Table 3 (Supplementary Material) shows the estimated Lion population size in 1993 and 2014 for each of the 47 sample subpopulations with percentage change, and it can be seen that most countries had a declining trend for sample Lion subpopulations, with only four countries (India, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe) seeing a growth trend. Table 4 (Supplementary Material) groups these countries with Botswana, which had a relatively low average rate of decline for its sample populations; two out of three sample subpopulations increased; the decline documented in the Okavango subpopulation was restricted to only part of the protected area; and overall 2012 estimates for the national population suggest that it his increased since 2003 (C. Winterbach unpubl. data). Mozambique is not included in this group as the increasing trend in its Niassa subpopulation is treated as an outlier in this analysis. The sample Lion population in five countries (Botswana, India, Namibia, South Africa, Zimbabwe) grew by an estimated 12%, whereas the Lion population in the remaining African range countries declined by an estimated 61% (Table 4, Supplementary Material).<br/><br/>We infer population trend for the total Lion species population based on these two rates of change, as follows. In 2002, two separate country compilations of population estimates for Lions in Africa estimated the number of Lions in Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe to comprise between 1/4 to 1/3 of the total African Lion population, as shown in Table 5 (Supplementary Material). We suspect that this proportion was somewhat lower in 1993, given that the number of Lions is inferred to have increased in these countries while decreasing in the remainder, and use a figure of 1/4 or 25% for our species population trend calculation. If 25% of the Lion population increased by 12%, and 75% decreased by 60%, this results in an inferred trend of (0.75*-60%) + (0.25*12%) = -43% between 1993 and 2014 (Table 6, Supplementary Material).</p><br/>This qualifies the Lion as Vulnerable, but it is of great concern that the vast majority of the population is inferred to have declined at a rate that meets the criteria for Endangered. Since our sample subpopulations were all monitored, we suspect an even greater average rate of decline for unmonitored unfenced subpopulations across much of Africa, since lack of monitoring could suggest lack of conservation effort.<br/><br/><strong>Abundance</strong><br/>For this assessment, we do not aim to provide a new estimate of total Lion numbers, we present no new data. A recent paper summarized and updated efforts to estimate the population size of the African Lion leading to the most recent estimate of 32,000 lions in 67 Lion areas (Riggio <em>et al</em>. 2013). The paper presents some recent data, but where no new data were available it included unaltered numbers from earlier sources, such as Bauer and Van der Merwe (2004) and Chardonnet (2002). As a consequence, Riggio <em>et al</em>. (2013) include numbers from 2002 and 2004 for areas where we believe the downward trend described above occurred. We therefore consider these sources to be insufficiently precautionary for our purpose and feel that an assessment on numbers is less robust than our assessment based on trends. Considering the difficulty in interpreting Lion numbers and the availability of an alternative (see above), we decided not to use total Lion numbers for the present assessment<br/><br/>However, we do attempt to correct for outdated sources in the Riggio <em>et al</em>. (2013) estimate by application of the regional trends we found (Table 3, Supplementary Material) to the 2002 population size estimates within the respective regions (Bauer and Van der Merwe 2004, Chardonnet 2002). These are two largely independent and reasonably comprehensive sets of estimated numbers that were coherent in time. Rather than presenting these numbers as in any way current, we look at how they might be expected to have changed.&#160;We calculated estimated present Lion numbers per region (Table 7, Supplementary Material) by applying the observed trend over the subsequent 12 years, except that numbers for West Africa were taken from a comprehensive recent survey (Henschel <em>et al</em>. 2014) because of their greater precision. As a small modification from Chardonnet (2002) we moved the estimate for Selous ecosystem to Eastern Africa to be consistent with the regional divisions used here. The two 2002 estimates were compared in detail (Bauer <em>et al</em>. 2005a,b), showing the ALWG study (Bauer and Van der Merwe 2004) was more conservative and stricter on data quality. Most notably, Bauer and Van Der Merwe (2004) lacked data for Ruaha and Tarangire which may hold close to 5,000 Lions. With all these considerations, we have greater confidence in an estimate of closer to 20,000 Lions in Africa than in a number over 30,000.<br/><br/><strong>Approach to Uncertainty&#160;</strong>We do not have sufficient confidence in earlier or recent species population estimates to employ them to estimate trend and for this assessment have used groupings of scientific time series site estimates as a proxy. &#160;Although these data are more numerous for Lions than for other big <em>Panthera </em>cats, there is still considerable uncertainty inherent in both the data (Bauer <em>et al</em>. 2015) and our treatment of it to estimate species population trend. Guidelines for Using the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (IUCN 2014) state that, ""All attitudes (towards uncertainty) should be explicitly documented. &#160;In situations where the spread of plausible values (after excluding extreme or unlikely values) qualifies a taxon for two or more categories of threat, the precautionary approach would recommend that the taxon be listed under the higher (more threatened) category.""&#160;<br/>As noted in Table 2 (see Supplementary Material), if the species trend is inferred directly from the total sample population trend, the result, a decline of 22%, would qualify the species as Near Threatened rather than Vulnerable. However, considering the demonstrated significant regional differences such an approach would be inappropriate.&#160;<br/>We treated Mozambique's Niassa subpopulation trend as an outlier and removed it from our trend analysis for reasons described above, but we also documented the effect of the exclusion. Some contributors proposed a second outlier: Tanzania’s Katavi subpopulation. Katavi has been consistently and repeatedly monitored, but the survey methodology was imprecise (vehicle transects: Caro 2011), this yielded a significant decline rate approaching 100% in a large population of over 1,100 estimated lions in the study site portion of the park in 1993 (Table 3). If Katavi would have been treated as an outlier and excluded from the analysis, inferred rate of decline would be 33%, and the rate of decline for Lions in East Africa would be 37%. Lions are still extant in Katavi (as shown in our map), although well below carrying capacity (Kiffner <em>et al.</em> 2008). Rather than using an arbitrary low value, we used the value documented by surveys (zero); Lions are extant but at a density so low as not to be detected. While the methodology is imprecise, it has proved reliable for carnivore monitoring in the Serengeti (Durant <em>et al</em>. 2011). Furthermore, the extent of decline may have been measured with lack of precision, but population decline remains uncontested. Since it is one of only two long-term monitoring programmes in Tanzania (Caro 2011) we decided that it was important to include these data and decided that there was insufficient ground to treat it as an outlier.<br/>Another uncertainty that needs to be documented is our treatment of small fenced reserves in southern Africa. Most of the population increases have occurred in these areas where intensive management practices include translocations, stocking, contraception and euthanasia. Such management is atypical, and as pointed out by Hayward <em>et al</em>. (2015) the Red List Guidelines are ambiguous as to the inclusion or exclusion of fenced areas. Their exclusion from the analysis would raise the inferred Lion decline rate to 49%. Following through on our supposition that unmonitored Lion populations have undergone an even higher rate than our monitored sample, this could potentially have been interpreted as a suspected rate of decline over 50%, qualifying the Lion as Endangered. However, we did not exclude fenced populations from our assessment. Hayward <em>et al</em>. (2015) state that such decisions should consider the ‘type, scale, frequency and effects of the suite of management interventions’ and could be taxon specific. We consider that management of Lions in the concerned areas aims to mimic natural processes, aims to retain adaptive potential and follows a meta-population management approach. We further consider that fences have been documented as effective tools in Lion conservation (Packer<em> et al</em>. 2013). We find this sufficient justification for inclusion of these reserves.<br/>National estimated rates of population change are most meaningful in practice, and these are given in Table 3 in the Supplementary Material. &#160;We did not use national rates to gauge species decline, as the sample sizes are generally small and estimates of national Lion populations imprecise.",Decreasing,"Outside sub-Saharan Africa, the Lion formerly ranged from Northern Africa through Southwest Asia (where it disappeared from most countries within the last 150 years), west into Europe, where it apparently became extinct almost 2,000 years ago, and east into India (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Today, the only remainder of this once widespread northern population is a single isolated subpopulation in the 1,400 km² Gir Forest National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary. Lions are extinct in North Africa, having perhaps survived in the High Atlas Mountains up to the 1940s (Nowell and Jackson 1996, West and Packer 2013).<br/><br/>Lions are found in most countries of sub-Saharan Africa. The last assessment of extant Lion range is provided by Riggio <em>et al</em>. (2013); they identified 67 Lion areas comprising 3.4 million km², which is 17% of historical range or about 25% of savanna Africa. We took those layers as a starting point, but made a few modifications to reflect the cautionary approach used by the IUCN Red List. Like with population numbers (see Population section), Riggio <em>et al</em>. (2013) copied old layers in the absence of new information. <em>De facto</em>, this means that large swathes of land are classified as Lion range based on the group exercises led by the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and the IUCN SSC Cat Specialist Group; they found 86 Lion Conservation Units (LCUs) covering 4.6 million km² or 22% of historical range (IUCN 2006a,b; Bauer 2008). Henschel <em>et al</em>. (2010, 2014) found that many of these LCUs in West and Central Africa no longer contained Lions, and the range map was adapted accordingly for this assessment. Similarly, the survey and mapping unit at Panthera conducted further range updates based on new survey results and other properly documented information from other regions. Furthermore, some of the mapped LCUs are located in areas where armed conflict may have had an impact on lion persistence (e.g. Central African Republic and South Sudan). Until proof of the contrary, and based on the lack of recent data to confirm Lion presence, we therefore classified such areas as Possibly Extinct but maintained Protected Areas inside them as Lion range (including many large hunting concessions, such as in the Central African Republic). Some of the areas currently mapped as Possibly Extinct could contain relict Lion subpopulations, and should be prioritized for field surveys aimed at establishing Lion status.<br/><br/>Areas where we consider Lion populations Possibly Extinct total 1,811,087 km², over half (52%) of the range classified as extant by Riggio <em>et al</em>. (2013). We estimate extant Lion range, areas where we are reasonably confident that lions persist, based on recent records, at 1,654,375 km², or 8% of historical range. This range reduction reflects a combination of recent known and inferred decline, as well as improved knowledge.",For information on Use and Trade see under Threats.,Terrestrial,"Since 1975 <em>Panthera leo</em> has been included in CITES Appendix II, and&#160; the Endangered Asiatic Lion subspecies <em>P. leo persica</em> in CITES Appendix I. CITES listing of the Lion is currently undergoing a Periodic Review process to evaluate whether this accurately reflects the present situation, with a final recommendation of the Animals Committee expected at its 28th meeting in 2015. The Animals Committee also noted recent information regarding possible changes in the nomenclature of Lions and requests its nomenclature expert to&#160; review this information (CITES AC27 WG8). <br/><br/>In Africa, Lions are present in a number of large and well-managed protected areas, and remain one of the most popular animals on the must-see lists of tourists and visitors to Africa. Most range states in East and Southern Africa have an infrastructure which supports wildlife tourism, and in this way Lions generate significant cash revenue for park management and local communities and provide a strong incentive for wildland conservation.<br/><br/>Regional conservation strategies have been developed for Lions in West and Central Africa (IUCN 2006a) and Eastern and Southern Africa (IUCN 2006b). By setting out common priorities to guide action on both national, community and landscape levels, the regional conservation strategies have the potential for broad and significant improvement of Lion status and management (Nowell <em>et al</em>. 2006). These regional strategies have been used in many countries to develop Lion Conservation Action Plans. While all these documents show awareness of the threats and recognition of solutions, the continued decline in Lion range and numbers show that political priority and funding are not sufficient (Packer <em>et al</em>. 2013).<em></em>",Afrotropical|Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

The taxon is subject to population fluctuations due to disease and effects of severe winter conditions. However, several recent authorities agree on a figure of approximately 1,000,000 and the range is expanding towards the north-west. Annual monitoring of the status of this species is required as an upsurge in illegal hunting in conjunction with adverse climatic conditions or outbreak of disease could result in a sharp fall qualifying for a classification of Near Threatened or Vulnerable.","Inhabits rolling arid steppes and grassy plains; in particular feather grass (<em>Stipa </em>spp<em>.)&#160;</em>steppes and sometimes semi-deserts (Sokolov and Lushchekina 1997). Mongolian Gazelles move constantly over their range in search of food, except during the rutting and birthing seasons.","The major threats to this species are disease outbreaks,&#160; illegal hunting, habitat conversion, habitat fragmentation, and severe winters. Illegal hunting (in addition to the legal harvest) is an increasing threat and male-biased hunting before and during the rut could have serious consequences for the fecundity of the population (Lhagvasuren and Milner-Gulland 1997).<br/><br/>The Ulaanbaatar-Beijing railway is double-fenced and has effectively cut off the smaller western populations from the core population in eastern Mongolia (Ito <em>et al.</em> 2005), although the large population and high mobility of the species has allowed sufficient gene flow (Okada <em>et al.</em> 2015). Outbreaks of disease and severe winters result in sporadic heavy mortality. Increasing livestock numbers has led to an increase in associated disease transmission (e.g. bacterial pneumonia caused by<em> Pasteurella</em>, viral influenza, foot-and-mouth, and anthrax) (Lhagvasuren and Milner-Gulland 1997, Schaller and Lhagvasuren 1998, Nyamsuren <em>et al. </em>2006).&#160;The distribution of Mongolian Gazelle is influenced by the activity of the vole <em>Lasiopodomys brandtii</em>. For example, in the 1990s a large increase in the <em>L. brandtii</em> population destroyed a huge area of pasture in Sukhbaatar and Dornod provinces and the gazelles disappeared from these areas and moved north (Lhagvasuren and Milner-Gulland 1997).","Population estimates over the last 10 years have ranged from 400,000 to 2,700,000.

Most of the current population is found in the eastern Mongolian steppes. Smaller populations are found in central and western Mongolia. Some move south into China in winter where at one time up to 250,000 may occurred. Numbers in China have been greatly reduced by hunting and expansion of agriculture and livestock grazing and it is considered Critically Endangered in the national Red List (Jiang <em>et al</em>. 2016).",Stable,"<em>Procapra gutturosa</em> occurs in eastern Mongolia and adjacent areas of Russia and north-eastern China. Smaller populations are still found in central and western Mongolia where they were previously abundant (Zahler <em>et al.</em> 2004). There is a translocated population on Homin Tal steppe in Zavkhan Province of west-central Mongolia. In the past 50 years, the geographic range of the Mongolian Gazelle has been reduced by about 76%. The vast majority of Mongolian Gazelles are now found in Mongolia itself; and within Mongolia the species is found in large numbers in only four provinces: Dornod, Khentii, Sukhbaatar and Dornogobi (Lhagvasuren and Milner-Gulland 1997) and in smaller numbers in other provinces.","The species is harvested for meat, hides and use of body parts (horn,&#160;liver, heart, lungs, kidneys and fat)&#160;in Asian medicine.&#160;Locally the tanned hides are used to produce chamois and the horns are made into handles for knives and various household articles (Sokolov and Lushchekina 1997). From the horns of young Mongolian Gazelles, the Institute of National Medicine under the Ministry of Public Health of the Mongolian People's Republic produced a drug named 'procaprin', which is said to exert sedative and tonic effects (Lhagvasuren and Milner-Gulland 1997, Sokolov and Lushchekina 1997).&#160;Former tight control in Mongolia has weakened during the last decade and tens of thousands (80-85 per cent of which are thought to be males) are killed illegally on top of the official harvest (Lhagvasuren and Milner-Gulland 1997). A hunting survey found that local herders in the eastern steppe region alone take as many as 150,000 gazelles annually (K. Olson, pers. comm. in Zahler <em>et al.</em> 2004). Above the total sustainable off-take of 6% a year, or&#160;60,000 gazelles, that&#160;harvest models suggest (Milner-Gulland and Lhagvasuren 1998).&#160;This hunting could be exacerbated if there is a commercial switch from Saiga to Mongolian Gazelle horns, and evidence for this ominous trend has been found in the recent increase in price for gazelle horns (Zahler <em>et al.</em> 2004).",Terrestrial,"Occurs in some protected areas in Mongolia but most of the population occurs outside these.

121229971,41688,Ursus arctos,Least Concern,,2017,2016-02-02 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The range of the Brown Bear has historically declined in North America, Europe, and Asia, and the species has been extirpated in North Africa. However, it remains widespread across three continents, and is still one of the world’s most widely distributed terrestrial mammals. Globally the population remains large, and is not significantly declining and may be increasing in some areas (Swenson <em>et al. </em>1998, Schwartz <em>et al. </em>2006, Mace <em>et al. </em>2012, Kaczensky <em>et al. </em>2013, Chapron<em> et al. </em>2014). There are many small, isolated subpopulations that are in jeopardy of extirpation, but others, under more protection and management, are expanding.</p>","<p>Brown Bears occupy a great variety of habitats from dry Asian steppes to Arctic shrublands to temperate rain forests. Their range overlaps that of both the American Black Bear (<em>Ursus americanus</em>) and Asiatic Black Bear (<em>U. thibetanus</em>), and also slightly that of the Polar Bear (<em>U. maritimus</em>). Elevationally they range from sea level to 5,000 m (Sathyakumar 2006). They occupy a greater diversity of habitats than any other species of bear and also exploit a large variety of food items. In terms of diet, they fall between the mainly plant-dependent ursids and the carnivorous polar bear (Mattson 1998, Sacco and Van Valkenburgh 2004). In North America, Brown Bears (Grizzly Bears) are more carnivorous where ungulates (especially in Arctic areas) or spawning salmon (coastal areas) are abundant (Mowat and Heard 2006). The productivity and density of brown bears varies enormously, corresponding with the productivity of their habitats and availability of salmon. Coastal areas of North America and Eastern Russia, with concentrations of spawning salmon, have high densities (&gt;100 bears per 1,000 km²) of Brown Bears (Miller <em>et al. </em>1997, Seryodkin 2006) with high reproductive rates (Hilderbrand <em>et al. </em>1999). Deciduous and mixed forests of the Dinaric and Carpathian mountain ranges of Eastern Europe also host high bear densities with high reproductive rates (Kusak and Huber 1998, Frković <em>et al.&#160;</em>2001). More moderate densities of bears (20-50 bears per 1,000 km²) occur across the interior mountain ranges of North America (McLellan 1994, Schwartz <em>et al. </em>2003, McLellan 2011), Europe, and Asia where they forage on a great variety of grasses, herbs, roots, berries, nuts, as well as animal matter such as insects, mammals, and fish if available. Moderate densities of bears are also found across portions of the boreal forests of North American, Asia and Scandinavia (Bellemain <em>et al. </em>2005). Lower densities (5‒15 bears per 1,000 km²) are found in dry, desert-like areas, alpine and sub-alpine areas, as well as areas where habitat availability and numbers of bears have been reduced by high human and domestic livestock densities (Nawaz 2007); however, in most of these areas (e.g., northern India, western China) density estimates are not available.<br/> <br/>Breeding occurs during April to July but implantation of the blastocyst is delayed until late autumn. Cubs, usually in litters of 1 to 3 (rarely 4 or 5), are born in January or early February when the mother is hibernating. In North America, female bears generally have their first litters at 5 to 8 years of age and have litters every three or four years thereafter (Schwartz <em>et al.</em> 2003). In some areas of Europe, however, females generally have their first litter at least one year earlier, and produce litters every two years (Swenson <em>et al. </em>2000, Frković <em>et al. </em>2001). At the other extreme, brown bears in northern Pakistan produced litters that average only 1.3 cubs every 5.7 years, on average (Nawaz <em>et al. </em>2008).</p>","<p>Although, as a whole, this species is secure with relatively large numbers and an expansive range, many small, isolated subpopulations are threatened due to their low numbers and frequent contact with humans. These small subpopulations tend to be found in remnant wild areas surrounded by more extensive human development. As wide-ranging omnivores, Brown Bears are attracted to areas with available human-related foods; being large and somewhat aggressive, these bears may threaten life and property (often agricultural products) and may be killed as a consequence. Areas of high human use that attract bears may serve as significant mortality sinks (Nielsen <em>et al. </em>2004, 2006). Additionally, bears living near humans may be killed inadvertently (e.g., vehicle or train collisions), poached for parts or products, or killed by people hunting for other species. Even small numbers of bears removed from small subpopulations can have adverse effects on population growth (Wakkinen and Kasworm 2004); conversely, preventing just a few deaths may avert a population decline (Wiegand <em>et al. </em>1998, Garshelis <em>et al. </em>2005). Where Brown Bears exist in a large, contiguous population, they are sometimes hunted for sport or killed for control purposes, and rates may sometimes be unsustainable at least over the short term (Lamb <em>et al</em>. submitted, McLellan 2015, McLellan <em>et al</em>. submitted). Estimates of sustainable exploitation are hampered by the difficulty and expense of obtaining reliable estimates of population size, natural mortality, and reproductive rates. Most countries do not have the resources to develop and implement adequate monitoring programs and sustainable management plans for Brown Bears. Moreover, even with such plans in place, illegal or unreported kill may equal or exceed the legal and supposedly sustainable kill (McLellan <em>et al. </em>1999, McLellan 2015). This is apparently occurring in the Russian Far East, where Brown Bears are poached for the commercial trade in gall bladders and paws (Seryodkin 2006). In portions of Alaska, the management goal is to reduce bear populations to encourage Moose and Caribou populations to expand for the benefit of hunters (Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011). In addition to direct removal of Brown Bears, many other human activities (such as agriculture, plantation forestry, highways, hydroelectric and wind power developments, and human settlements) eliminate, fragment, or erode the value of bear habitat (Proctor <em>et al. </em>2005, Waller and Servheen 2005, Proctor <em>et al.</em> 2012). Habitat fragmentation is a serious threat that isolates population units with deleterious demographic and genetic impacts (Proctor <em>et al. </em>2005, 2012). With increasing human populations, the value of Brown Bear habitat is being degraded in many areas (e.g., Can and Togan 2004, Nawaz 2007), while in other areas (i.e., Turkey), fewer people are now living in rural areas and conditions are improving for Brown Bears.<br/><br/>In Europe, four of ten subpopulations are Critically Endangered. However, the current public interest, financial investment and management actions, seem to presently secure most populations at least for their short to midterm survival. Portions of subpopulations in some countries are less secure due to lower local acceptance and correspondingly high human-caused mortality rates. Almost half of the subpopulations are currently growing, but to guarantee long-term survival, all present and potential future threats must be kept in check. The key threats for bears in Europe were identified as: habitat loss due to infrastructure development, disturbance, low acceptance, poor management structures, intrinsic factors, accidental mortality and persecution. Most threats were expected to increase in the future (Kaczensky <em>et al. </em>2013).</p>","<p>The total number of Brown Bears on earth is estimated to exceed 200,000. Reliable population estimates (derived mainly from mark-recapture or resight, and modifications thereof) exist for several areas in North America and Europe (Miller <em>et al. </em>1997, Swenson <em>et al.&#160;</em>2000, Bellemain<em> et al. </em>2005, Mowat <em>et al. </em>2005, Proctor <em>et al. </em>2010, 2012, Mowat <em>et al</em>. 2013), but few areas in Asia. Russia has the largest number of Brown Bears, believed to exceed 100,000, while estimates in the U.S. (mainly in Alaska) are around 33,000, Canada 25,000, and Europe (excluding Russia) 15,400. Whereas the species is relatively abundant in more northern parts of its distribution, the southern portions of the range are highly fragmented, with many small subpopulations. In North America, the southern fringe has isolated subpopulations ranging in size from near 700 bears in and around Yellowstone National Park (Haroldson <em>et al. </em>2013) to approximately 25 individuals in the Cabinet Mountains of Montana (Proctor <em>et al. </em>2004, Kendall <em>et al. </em>2016) and even less, likely &lt;10 bears, in some southern areas of British Columbia.<br/> <br/>In Europe, Brown Bears occur in 22 countries. Based on the existing data on distribution, as well as a range of geographical, ecological, social and political factors these can be clustered into 10 subpopulations (Chapron <em>et al.</em> 2014): Scandinavian, Karelian, Baltic, Carpathian, Dinaric-Pindos, Eastern Balkan, Alpine, Abruzzo, Cantabrian, and Pyrenean. Based on reported and updated census data, the largest population is the Carpathian population (&gt;8,000 bears), followed by the Scandinavian and Dinaric-Pindos populations (&gt; 3,400 and 3,040 bears, respectively). The other subpopulations are much smaller ranging from several hundred (e.g., Baltic ~700, Cantabrian ~200) to less than one hundred (e.g. Alps ~37 bears). Compared to the last survey, which included data up to 2005 (Bear Online Information System for Europe, BOIS), the Scandinavian, Dinaric-Pindos, and Cantabrian populations have recorded a clear increase. The other populations remained stable. The perceived decrease in the Eastern Balkan subpopulation is likely due to new monitoring techniques. All subpopulation ranges have been relatively stable or slightly expanding. In the Alpine subpopulation the loss of the central Austrian segment in the last decade was counter-balanced by the expansion of the north Italian segment in Trentino, due to translocations from Slovenia. The Pyrenean subpopulation also grew because of translocations from Slovenia (Kaczensky <em>et al. </em>2013).<br/> <br/>Small subpopulations of Brown Bears are also scattered across many portions of Asia, but relatively little is known of numbers or degree of connectivity. In Pakistan there are an estimated 15-30 animals in an isolated subpopulation in the Hindu Kush Range (M. A. Nawaz pers. comm., 2014). Another 130–220 bears are estimated to occur in what is thought to be an isolated subpopulation in the Himalaya Mountains of Pakistan and India (Sathyakumar <em>et al. </em>2012, Abbas <em>et al. </em>2015). There is another subpopulation of bears in the Karakoram-Pamir Mountains of Pakistan and these are likely joined across the Wakhan corridor and the Pamirs of Afghanistan, west of the Taklimakan Desert to the Hissaro-Alai and Pamirs population in southern Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. In China, Brown Bears exist in sparse, poorly defined populations in the west and also in the northeast, with guesstimates of ~6,000 and ~1,000 in each of these regions, respectively (Gong and Harris 2006). Three GPS-collared bears in the Sanjiangyuan Region of Tibet, two male and one female with cubs, had home ranges of &gt;7,000 km² and 2,200 km² respectively; these expansive home ranges suggest connectivity (but low density) within the dry, high mountains and plateaus of Tibet. A much more dense population on Hokkaido, Japan may have 2,200 or more Brown Bears, although even there, where significant information has been collected through research and sport harvest returns, reliable population estimates are not available (Mano 2006). There appears to be several isolated subpopulations in the Middle East including bears in the Elburz and Zagros Mountains of Iran and bordering areas in Iraq (Kurdistan), and what is thought to be several isolated subpopulations in Turkey, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Georgia. Perhaps the most isolated Brown Bear population in Asia is found in the Gobi desert of southern Mongolia and along the northern China border (currently 21‒29 bears; Tumendemberel <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/> <br/>In total, 44 subpopulations of Brown Bear have been identified globally; most occur in the southern portions of their circumpolar distribution across the northern hemisphere. Because many of these subpopulations are small, isolated, and in need of conservation attention, they have been assessed individually using the IUCN Red List Criteria for isolated subpopulations following the guidance of Gärdenfors <em>et al. </em>(2001) and IUCN (2012) (see the Supplementary Material attached to this document).</p>",Stable,"<p>The Brown Bear is the most widely distributed ursid. It once ranged across a large portion of western North America, including northern Mexico. There is also some evidence of sporadic occurrence (after retreat of the Wisconsin ice sheet) within the eastern half of the continent (Guilday 1968). Populations on the Ungava Peninsula may have extended to the Atlantic Ocean (Loring and Spiess 2007). They also ranged throughout Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and across North Africa. A history of prolonged overexploitation in Europe stretching back centuries resulted in the elimination of brown bears from many countries. The date of their extirpation from North Africa is uncertain, but they may have existed as late as the 1500s in the Sinai of Egypt (Manlius 1998) and mid-1800s in Algeria and Morocco (Hamdine <em>et al</em>. 1998). During the 20th century, Brown Bears (called Grizzly Bears in interior North America) were intentionally extirpated in Mexico (≈1960), a large portion of southwestern U.S. (Brown 1985, Mattson and Merrill 2002), and most of the Canadian prairies. Bears have been rare in the Middle East throughout the 1900s, and were believed to have been extirpated by the mid-1950s; however, recent sightings of tracks and a photo of a bear in western Syria, near the Lebanon border, suggests either a relict subpopulation, vagrants from Turkey, or released captive animals&#160; (Garshelis <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>Presently, Brown Bears occupy approximately 5,000,000 km² of the northwestern portion of North America, 1,200,000 km² of Europe (excluding Russia), and much of northern Asia. Resident populations are known to exist in 45 range countries. The largest numbers exist in Russia, the U.S. (Alaska), and Canada. Many populations in Europe and the more southerly portions of Asia and North America are small and isolated (Servheen <em>et al</em>. 1999, Swenson <em>et al</em>. 2000, Kaczensky <em>et al</em>. 2013). Very small numbers of Brown Bears still remain in several Asian countries such as Iraq and Nepal (Gurung 2004, Ridings 2006, Aryal <em>et al</em>. 2012). In Europe, Andorra was reoccupied in 2003 from bears reintroduced into the French Pyrenees. A few wandering individuals are periodically crossing into Switzerland from a reintroduced population in northern Italy, and into Lithuania from Latvia and Belarus, but not enough as yet to be considered as occupied range in these countries.</p>","<p>Where Brown Bears exist in a large, contiguous population, they are sometimes hunted for sport or killed for control purposes, and rates may sometimes be unsustainable at least over the short term (Lamb <em>et al. </em>submitted, McLellan 2015, McLellan <em>et al</em>. submitted). Estimates of sustainable exploitation are hampered by the difficulty and expense of obtaining reliable estimates of population size, natural mortality, and reproductive rates. Most countries do not have the resources to develop and implement adequate monitoring programs and sustainable management plans for Brown Bears. Moreover, even with such plans in place, illegal or unreported kill may equal or exceed the legal and supposedly sustainable kill (McLellan <em>et al. </em>1999, McLellan 2015). This is apparently occurring in the Russian Far East and China, where brown bears are poached for the commercial trade in gall bladders and paws (Seryodkin 2006, Servheen 2013, Burgess <em>et al. </em>2014). In portions of Alaska, the management goal is to reduce bear populations to encourage Moose and Caribou populations to expand for the benefit of hunters (Miller <em>et al. </em>2011).</p>",Terrestrial,"<p>Conservation actions for Brown Bears vary greatly among nations and regions within nations. Large populations of this species (in Russia, Japan, Canada, Alaska, and parts of eastern and northern Europe) are legally hunted, and thus managed as a game animal. Hunting regulations, usually designed to ensure a sustainable harvest of bears, vary among areas but often involve a lottery for a limited number of permits (a quota system) and restricted season length. Most small populations are protected by national laws and international agreements, with varying degrees of enforcement. Brown Bear as a species is listed under CITES Appendix II; the populations in Bhutan (if they exist), China, and Mongolia, and those classified as the subspecies <em>Ursus arctos isabellinus</em> (northern India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, to Kazakhstan and Gobi desert) are listed under Appendix I. Furthermore, international trade in bears and bear products from certain populations in countries of the European Union is restricted by EU regulations. In parts of the U.S., small populations of Grizzly Bears have increased under protection of the Endangered Species Act (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2005). Reintroductions, population augmentations, and connectivity management also have helped to restore numbers and geographic range in several locations in the U.S., southern Canada, and Western Europe (Clark <em>et al. </em>2002, Kasworm <em>et al. </em>2007). There are numerous protected areas around the world with Brown Bears, but few are large enough to support a viable population; therefore, Brown Bear conservation must be integrated with many other human land-uses (Herrero 1994, Nielsen <em>et al. </em>2006). Some countries have rules or management guidelines designed to reduce human impacts on Brown Bears and their habitat, whereas in other countries bear management protocols and regulations are limited or non-existent (Servheen<em> et al. </em>1999, Zedrosser <em>et al. </em>2001, Kaczensky <em>et al. </em>2013).<br/><br/>In Europe most of the bear populations are protected by the Habitat Directive (Habitat Directive;&#160; <a href=""http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:01992L0043-20070101&amp;from=EN""><span lang=""EN-US"">http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:01992L0043-20070101&amp;from=EN</a>) which is compulsory for all EU countries. Portions of populations that fall within EU countries are not allowed to be classified as game animals.&#160; However, Sweden, Finland, Romania, Estonia, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Croatia currently use derogations under article 16 of the Habitat Directive to allow a limited kill of bears by hunters. Bosnia and Herzegovina and Norway manage bears as a game species with annual quotas as they are only limited by the Bern Convention. Trophy hunting of bears enhances local acceptance of these animals by the public in some populations (Knott <em>et al.</em> 2013). Nearly all European countries have some form of bear management plan, action plan or bear management strategy. However, in a number of countries these documents have not been adequately implemented.</p>",Indomalayan|Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

The species is targeted for local consumption across most of its range and is increasingly targeted for international trafficking – mainly its scales – to overseas markets, mainly China. There appears to have been a shift in trafficking attention to this species following declines in populations of the Sunda and Chinese Pangolin. This dynamic is compounded by the likelihood that law enforcement changes on a level needed to prevent the overexploitation of the species are unlikely to occur within three generations time, and there is currently weak evidence that demand reduction efforts in key consumer countries for Asian pangolin products and derivatives are effective, which theoretically could lead to a reduction in harvest, and the incentives for harvesting and illegally trading the species are high across the species' range based on the high financial value of pangolin scales.<br/></p><p><br/></p>","Generally, little is known about the natural history of this species, but it is understood to occur in various types of tropical forests as well as open land, grasslands, arid areas and degraded habitat, including in close proximity to villages (Prater 1971, Roberts 1977). The species is thought to adapt well to modified habitats, provided its ant and termite prey remains abundant and provided it is not subject to hunting pressure. The species uses olfaction to locate prey and is prey selective: in Pakistan, two species of black ants, <em style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"">Camponotus confucii</em> and <em style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"">C. compressus</em> comprised the majority of prey consumed, with one termite species, <em style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"">Odontotermi sobesus</em> comprising a much smaller proportion based on fecal analysis in the Potohar Plateau (Irshad<em style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;""> et al.</em> 2015).<br/>The Indian Pangolin is generally solitary, nocturnal and burrow-dwelling except when mating, when adult males and females share the same burrow, which are often under large rocks and the entrance concealed by dirt (Prater 1971, Roberts 1977, Tikader 1983). Adult Indian Pangolins weigh 10-20 kg and grow to up to 148 cm long (Mahmood<em> et al. </em>2019). The species displays sexual dimorphism, where males are generally larger and heavier than females (Roberts 1977). The tail, often almost the same length as the body (Irshad <em>et al</em>. 2016), is used for climbing trees and for balance when walking (Prater 1971). Similarly, this species possesses a long tongue, reaching up to 42.5 cm in length, which is used to capture and ingest prey (Irshad <em>et al</em>. 2016). Individuals have strong forelimbs with large and powerful claws used for excavating ant nests and termite mounds, as well as for grip when climbing. Vital for seeking prey and searching for a mate, the Indian Pangolin has excellent olfactory senses (Roberts 1977). Females usually give birth to one young, although twins are reported (Mahmood<em> et al. </em>2015b) after a gestation period of approximately six months. Juveniles are nursed by the mother, who will coil around her young (Acharjyo 2000, Mohapatra and Panda 2014) and carry it on her tail for protection whilst foraging (Roberts 1977, Israel <em style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"">et al</em>. 1987). It is estimated sexual maturity is reached at 3 years (see Mahmood <em>et al</em>. 2019). Longevity in the wild is unknown, but in captivity an individual persisted for 19 years (Weigl 2005). Although mainly ground-dwelling, this species is arboreal in some habitats, and is a good climber, using its prehensile tail and claws to climb trees (Prater 1971, Heath 1995).","<p>The Indian Pangolin is primarily threatened by overexploitation including hunting and poaching for both its meat and scales which are used and consumed at a local, subsistence level, but increasingly for illegal international trade (Misra and Hanfee 2000; Mahmood <em>et al.</em> 2012, Challender and Waterman 2017, D'Cruze <em>et al.</em> 2018). This species has historically been exploited locally. Its meat is consumed as a source of protein locally (e.g., in India, Kanagavel <em>et al.</em> 2016) and its scales have been used in whole or powdered form in the preparation of traditional medicines and as curios in Pakistan (Roberts 1977). There is evidence that the species is being severely impacted in Pakistan i.e. directly targeted and killed so the scales can be removed and illegally exported to China and it is suspected that this has caused local extirpations (Mahmood <em>et al.</em> 2012). In India, hunting of pangolins has been recorded in Arunachal Pradesh, and specifically regarding the Indian Pangolin hunting/poaching is known to occur Periyar Tiger reserve (Kerala), the Western Ghats and eastern states of India including Odisha (Mitra 1998, Misra and Hanfee 2000; Gubbi and Linkie 2012). There are also reports of the involvement of tribal communities such as <em>Padhis, Saperas, Bawarias </em>and <em>Mongias </em>in the capture of pangolins (Sharma 2014) and pangolin scales have reportedly increased in price (prior to export) in India in the last 20 years (Chinlampianga<em> et al.</em> 2013). The meat, bile, scales and claws of pangolins are reportedly used by tribal communities including the <em>Paaudi Bhuanya </em>tribe of Odisha, <em>Biate </em>tribe of Assam, <em>Katkaris </em>folk of Maharashtra, <em>Gond </em>tribe of Madhya Pradesh, and <em>Mizo </em>ethnic group of Mizoram (Mohapatra <em>et al.</em> 2015). D'Cruze <em>et al.</em> (2018) report that pangolins, both Chinese and Indian species continue to be hunted and consumed locally, but the scales are illegally exported because of the high financial returns available.</p><p>There has been limited trade in this species reported to CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (see Challender and Waterman 2017). <span lang=""EN-US"">However, the species has been trafficked since at least the early 2000s for consumptive use in China (Wu and Ma 2007). International t<span lang=""EN-US"">rafficking today primarily involves scales, which are sourced from all range states, including Sri Lanka, and are primarily destined for China. T<span lang=""EN-US"">he scales are either shipped directly (e.g., by post) or are trafficked along routes through Myanmar and Nepal (Mahmood <em>et al.</em> 2012, Challender and Waterman 2017, Heinrich <em>et al.</em> 2017, Perera <em>et al.</em> 2017). It is estimated that between 2011 and 2017 at least 1724 Indian Pangolin were trafficked internationally (Challender and Waterman 2017) though the actual number involved is likely much higher. This is partly because of low detection rates associated with illegal wildlife trade and because the species of pangolin involved in wildlife trafficking are rarely identified. Challender<em> et al.</em> (2019) report that between 2000 and 2018, a combination of live animals, dead individuals and parts and derivatives equating to an estimated 300,000 Asian pangolins were trafficked globally. Trafficking in the Indian Pangolin may be related to declines in populations of the Chinese and Sunda Pangolins, and potentially <span lang=""EN-US"">increasing awareness of the monetary value of scales (D’Cruze <em>et al. </em>2018).&#160;</span></span></p><p>Other threats<span lang=""EN-US""> include the expansion of agriculture, habitat loss and deterioration, which opens up previously inaccessible areas to hunting and poaching, pesticide use and roadkill (Karawita <em>et al.</em> 2018, Murthy and Mishra 2010).</p>","<p>There is very limited information or data on population of this species at any level, and generally there is a lack of research on abundance. Historical accounts suggest the species is uncommon, rarely observed and occurs at low densities (Philips 1981, Roberts 1977). In the Potohar Plateau, Pakistan, Irshad<em> et al.</em> (2015) estimated population density based on counts of active burrows between 2010 and 2013. Across the four districts studied estimated density declined by ~79% between 2010 and 2012 (Irshad <em>et al.</em> 2015), which has been attributed to illegal capture and killing for international trade in pangolin scales (Mahmood <em>et al.</em> 2012). Similarly, in 2012 estimated densities comprised 0.37 ± 0.12 individuals/km² in Chakwal, 0.12 ± 0.08 individuals/km² in Jhelum, 0.10 ± 0.00 individuals/km² in Rawalpindi, and 0.33 ± 0.24 individuals/km² in Attock (Irshad <em>et al.</em> 2015). Using the same method, M<span>ahmood<em> et al.</em> (2015a) estimated an average density 0.36 individuals/km² in Margalla Hills National Park, and 0.00044 individuals/km² in Maneshra district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, Pakistan (Mahmood <em>et al.</em> 2018). However, it should be noted that there are limitation to the methods used here; it can be inferred from other species of pangolin that this species likely uses multiple burrows in a very short period and as such these estimated should be treated with caution (see Willcox <em>et al.</em> 2019 for discussion on methods).</p><p>In Sri Lanka, <span lang=""EN-US"">Pabasara <em>et al.</em> (2015) estimated population density at Yagirala Forest Reserve in the southwest of the country&#160; to be 5.69 individuals/km<sup>2</sup>, based on modelling camera trap records without identification of individual animals (see Rowcliffe <em>et al.</em> 2008). This is potentially an underestimate based on known exploitation of populations in the area. These densities are far higher than anywhere else in the species’ range and may be due to habitat differences, i.e. tropical lowland rainforest supporting a broader and more abundant prey base. Overexploitation of populations by excessive hunting may have almost eliminated pangolins from some parts of the country (P. Perera, pers. comm).<br/></span></p><p>  </p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">There are no quantitative population data available for India, Nepal or Bangladesh though it can be inferred and/or suspected that populations in each range state are in decline based on indiscriminate and apparently increasing rates of exploitation. Challender <em>et al.</em> (2019) estimated that between 2000 and 2018 around 300,000 Asian pangolins were trafficked internationally, though it is difficult to accurately quantify how much of this illegal trade involved the Indian Pangolin. <span lang=""EN-US"">T<span lang=""EN-US"">here are contemporary records of the species in various protected areas (see the Geographic Range setcion). Further research is needed to determine the status of populations in all range states, including Bangladesh, and the impact of exploitation for local use and international trafficking.&#160;</span></p>",Decreasing,"<p>This species is distributed in South Asia from northern and southeastern Pakistan through much of India south of the Himalayas (excluding far northeastern portions of the country), southern Nepal, and Sri Lanka (Prater 1971, Roberts 1977, Schlitter 2005, Srinivasulu and Srinivasulu 2012). The species is likely to occur in northern and western Bangladesh (A. Ghose and S. Trageser, pers. comm.). Some reference works refer to the occurrence of the species in Yunnan Province, southwestern China, but there is no evidence to support this, and there are no records from Myanmar (Mahmood <em>et al.</em> 2019).</p><p>This species is very locally distributed in Pakistan but has been recorded in all four provinces. In the north it has been recorded in Sialkot, Jhelum and Gujrat Districts in Punjab, extending across the Salt Range into Kohat District, and from Attock District (formerly known as Campbellpur) up to Mardan and Peshawar in the North West Frontier Province (Roberts 1977). There are also records from before 2009 in Nowshera and Swabi (F. Abbas, unpubl. data). It has also been found in the Potohar Plateau Range upwards into the Himalayan foothills (up to 750 m asl). This species is also present in the districts of Kotli, Mirpur and Bhimber in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (R. Hussain, unpubl. data). There are records of the species within the last five years from the Indus River floodplain, including the districts of Bhakar and Jhang (F. Abbas, unpubl. data). Further south there are records from the hilly regions in the western part of the Dadu and Larkana deserts (Sindh), extending southward through Las Bela and Mekran. It also occurs east of the Indus in Hyderabad district and Tharparkar, extending eastwards to Kutch (Roberts 1977).</p><p>Widely distributed in India from the Himalayan foothills to the far south, except the far northeast (Tikader, 1983). There are records from Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand, Delhi, Rajasthan, <span lang=""EN-US"">Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, and West Bengal (Agrawal <em>et al</em>. 1992, Choudhury 2001, Srinivasulu and Srinivasulu 2012). The northeastern limits of distribution are not well understood. Choudhury (2001) reports that an individual was caught in Nagaon district, Assam in the 1990s. The is the eastern most record of the species, and it possibly occurs in Meghalaya (Agrawal <em>et al</em>. 1992). There is a record from Manas National Park (Goswami<span lang=""EN-US""> and Ganesh 2014) where the species appears to be sympatric with the Chinese Pangolin. T<span lang=""EN-US"">here are records from Odisha and Mishra and Panda (2012) recorded the presence of the species in nearly half the 30 districts in the state.<span lang=""EN-US"">The Indian Pangolin occurs in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh.

Recent distribution records suggest that the species is distributed in all nine provinces of the country, inhabiting environments up to 1,850 m asl, with occurrence records from Nuwara Eliya District (Perera <em>et al</em>. in prep). However, records from the coastal lowlands in Jaffna peninsula are rather scarce. This species has been recorded from all dry zone National Parks of Sri Lanka and&#160; has also been recorded from coastal and near shore areas.&#160;</p><p>This species is distributed in lowland areas of southern and western Nepal (Baral and Shah 2008), and is found in a number of protected areas (see the Conservation section).&#160;<span>Within Parsa Wildlife Reserve, it is possible the species is sympatric with the Chinese <span>P<span>angolin.

Trageser <em>et al.</em> (2017) reviewed the status of pangolins in Bangladesh; it is likely that the species occurs in west and northwestern areas. There are records of the species in neighbouring West Bengal in India from 2018 (A. Ghose and S.

Evidence indicates a decline in area of occupancy and habitat quality over a period of three generations (45 years) based on forest loss in West and Central Africa (Hansen <em>et al.</em> 2013, Mayaux <em>et al.</em> 2013, Achard <em>et al.</em> 2014) resulting in the species qualifying for A2c. It also meets criteria A2d on the basis that it is reasonable to infer, and coinciding with forest loss, that populations have declined by 50% over a period of three generations (1974-2019) due to exploitation for local consumption and more recently harvest for international trafficking to Asian markets. The species also meets criteria A4cd using a period of 45 years (three generations; 30 years past, 15 years future) because it is inferred that suitable habitat has been lost in the last 30 years (Hansen <em>et al.</em> 2013, Mayaux <em>et al.</em> 2013, Achard <em>et al.</em> 2014), and will continue to be so, while populations have been and are expected to continue to be overexploited. Intercontinental trafficking of tropical African pangolin scales to Asia has seemingly increased in the last decade and governance and law enforcement changes on a level needed to prevent the overexploitation of the species are unlikely to occur within one generations time; there is increasing Chinese investment in West and Central Africa which is apparently facilitating pangolin trafficking; there is currently weak evidence that demand reduction efforts in key consumer countries for African pangolin derivatives, which theoretically could lead to a reduction in harvest, will be effective; and the population of sub-Saharan Africa is expected to double by 2050 with the largest increases in countries including DRC (United Nations, 2019) thereby placing greater pressure on populations of this species. A generation length of 15 years has been used for this assessment based on the estimated generation length for Temminck’s Pangolin (<em>Smutsia temminckii</em>); however, it should be noted that there is a great deal of uncertainty surrounding this estimate and further research into the life history of the Giant Pangolin is required in order to make a more informed estimate of generation length.  <strong></strong>","<p>The Giant Pangolin<em> </em>occurs in primary and secondary rainforest forest formations, gallery forests, swamp forests, forest-savannah mosaic habitats and wooded savannah (Hoffmann <em>et al. </em>2019). The species also persists discontinuously in savannah woodland /agricultural mosaics in central and southwestern Uganda (N. Matthews and S. Nixon unpubl. data). In Tanzania it has been recorded in bamboo stands in miombo woodland (Foley <em>et al. </em>2014). It is thought that the species may be dependent on access to permanent water sources (Kingdon <em>et al. </em>2013), although this requires confirmation. The species is found across a wide altitudinal gradient, from sea level on the Gabon coast to at least 2200 a.s.l. in the Albertine rift escarpment forests of eastern DRC (S. Nixon, unpubl. data). &#160;The Giant Pangolin is myrmecophagous and feeds on ants (including <em>Palthothyreus</em> and <em>Anomma)</em>, and termites (including the genera <em>Macrotermes</em>, <em>Pseudocanthotermes</em>, <em>Odontotermes</em>, <em>Cubitermes</em>, <em>Apicotermes</em> and <em>Protermes;</em> Vincent 1964; Pagès 1970) but other insect species may also be taken (Kingdon 1971). It is a terrestrial species; animals spend the daytime resting under piles of plant debris, in thickets, under fallen tree roots, in partially opened termitaria, or in burrows (Kingdon&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). Individuals may have relatively consistent home ranges, although average home range size is not known and may vary quite substantially across different habitats (Pagès 1970, Kingdon 1971, S. Nixon, unpubl. data) and between sexes (N. Matthews and S Nixon unpubl. data). Individuals are primarily solitary although females are sometimes seen with their young and camera trap surveys have detected individuals walking close together suggesting some association (Bruce <em>et al. </em>2017, N. Matthews and S. Nixon unpubl. data). Scent marking behaviour is evident and commonly observed in both male and female Giant Pangolins in central Uganda which may reflect territorial and/or, pre-copulatory behaviour (N. Matthews and S. Nixon unpubl. data). Their reproductive biology is not well known; breeding may be seasonal and females usually give birth to a single young, possibly annually, but perhaps every second year. Generation time is estimated at 15 years based on the calculated generation time of&#160;Temminck’s Pangolin (<em>S. temminckii)</em> but may be longer.</p><p>  <strong></strong><em></em><u></u><sub></sub><sup></sup><br/></p>","<p>As with other pangolin species, unsustainable levels of hunting and poaching are the primary threat to the long-term survival of the Giant Pangolin. The species is subject to widespread exploitation for bushmeat and use in traditional medicine and is regularly recorded in bushmeat markets (Colyn&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1987, Bräutigam <em>et al.</em> 1994, Fa&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1995, Bowen-Jones 1998, Ayeni <em>et al.</em>&#160;2001). Colyn <em>et al.</em> (1987) found that this species comprised one-tenth of the total number of pangolins (~100) on sale as bushmeat in rural areas around Kisangani, Democratic Republic of the Congo. In 2004, Giant Pangolins contributed 5,019 kg in terms of harvested biomass (including either whole animals and/or animal parts) from five markets monitored in Gabon, compared to 2,053 kg for White-bellied Pangolins (<em>Phataginus tricuspis</em>) and 335 kg for Black-bellied Pangolins (<em>P. tetradactyla</em>; Kingdon&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). </p><p>Market surveys across range countries have revealed the price of Giant Pangolins has increased substantially over the past two decades with Mambeya <em>et al.</em> (2018) recording a 211% price rise (compared to a 73% rise in the price of arboreal pangolins) between 2002 and 2014 in Liberville, Gabon. Further, while Giant Pangolins were not recorded among the 18 most commonly traded species between 2002 and 2006, a 2014 study revealed they were the seventh most traded species forming 3.6% of all carcasses sold. Ingram <em>et al.</em> (2018) concluded that prices rose 5.8 times across central Africa between 1993 and 2004 , estimating&#160; that 0.4-2.7 million pangolins were harvested every year in Africa during this period including 100,000 Giant Pangolins per annum. In Nigeria numbers of Giant Pangolins for sale in bushmeat markets have increased since 2003 as White-bellied Pangolins become harder to source (D. Soewu, unpubl. data). Figures from bushmeat markets are likely to underestimate the actual offtake: Fa <em>et al.</em> (1995) noted that survey records of Giant Pangolin meat in the markets of Bioko were misleading as only 10% made it to market. Similarly, in Liberia, only 25% of the harvest is sold, as local hunters preferred it to other species, while harvest rates in six communities adjacent to Sapo National Park were found to be unsustainable (Kingdon&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). The breakdown of taboos protecting the species has led to increased hunting pressure in some areas. For example, local protection afforded by totems in western Côte d’Ivoire has broken down due to refugee movements throughout the region as a result of conflicts in Liberia and Côte d’Ivoire (Kingdon&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). </p><p>The species is increasingly recorded in international trade. There are no reports of trade in live specimens in the CITES trade reports between 1996 and 2011, however in 2012 50 individuals were reportedly exported from Togo to Lao PDR for commercial purposes and in 2015 100 live animals were exported from Nigeria to China for use in captive breeding according to the CITES trade data (Challender and Waterman 2017). Between 2011 and this species being listed on CITES Appendix I in January 2017, 3,268.14 kg of Giant Pangolin scales (an estimated 908 individuals) were traded internationally (Challender &amp; Waterman 2017).</p><p>The true scale of the illegal international trade is unknown, but between 2012 and 2017 6,115kg of Giant Pangolin scales were seized, equating to an estimated 1,697 individuals (Challender and Waterman 2017). These shipments were all apparently destined for markets in East or Southeast Asia. It is estimated that between 2015 and 2019 the equivalent of more than 400,000 African pangolins were trafficked&#160;either in Africa bound for Asia, or en route to East Asian countries, including the Giant Pangolin (Challender<em> et al.</em> 2019; D. Challender, unpubl. data). In 2018 and 2019 there were numerous very large seizures (e.g. up to and &gt;12 tonnes of African pangolin scales) of shipments en route to Asia, and which likely included scales from Giant Pangolin. Ilegal intercontinental trade is a serious and growing threat to Africa’s pangolins, particularly as the illicit nature of the trade means that it is likely that the vast majority of such exports are not detected. This species' large size, low reproductive rate and terrestrial habits make it particularly vulnerable to over-exploitation (Kingdon&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013).</p><p>Habitat loss is also a threat. Past and present declines in Giant Pangolin area of occupancy (AOO) and habitat quality likely differ between West and Central Africa. West Africa has deforestation rates that are three times higher than in the Congo Basin forests (Mayaux et al. 2013), with some countries having lost up to 98% of their natural forest cover (e.g. Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana; Achard et al. 2014; Mayaux et al. 2013; Knauer et al. 2014; Liu et al. 2017). West Africa also has higher human population densities (Tatem 2017), and smaller patches of roadless areas (Ibisch et al. 2016) than Central Africa. Annual deforestation is higher in areas with higher human population density (Mayaux et al. 2013). In 2018, the Democratic Republic of the Congo had the second highest loss of tropical primary forest in the world, while Ghana and Cote d’Ivoire ranked 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> (of countries with &gt;100,000 ha of primary forest) in terms of their percent increase in forest loss from 2017 at 60% and 26% respectively (World Resources Institute 2019), however true rates of loss are imperfectly known.</p>","<p>This is a solitary, nocturnal and elusive species which is difficult to census and as a result there is no reliable information on population abundance or densities (or occupancy). Recent camera trapping surveys have given information on the relative abundance of the species in some study areas across their range, including in Tanzania, and Cameroon (Foley <em>et al.</em> 2014, Bruce <em>et al.</em> 2017). Detection rates for Giant Pangolins tend to be low using systematic or random camera trapping methods. Data collated from 17 camera trap studies across eight countries (Cameroon, DRC, Gabon, Liberia, Congo, Rwanda, South Sudan and Uganda) between 2010 and 2016, and representing 1993 camera trap stations and 137,145 trap nights, revealed the proportion of Giant Pangolin detections (naïve occupancy) was only 0.13, and the proportion of sampling occasions with detections (naïve detection probability) was 0.02 (Khwaja <em>et al.</em> in prep). Recent studies however indicate that camera-trapping rates can be improved through targeted efforts (Bruce <em>at al.</em> 2017; N. Matthews and S. Nixon, unpubl. data). Density and abundance are likely to be influenced by a variety of factors including habitat suitability, prey availability, levels of anthropogenic persecution, and to a lesser extent predation levels from large carnivores. The species is believed to be generally rare and populations are thought to be declining across their range.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>The species is widely but discontinuously distributed throughout West and Central Africa in a broad range of habitats including primary and secondary rainforest formations, swamp forest, forest savannah mosaics and savannah woodlands. It is recorded from Senegal (though there is no evidence of its presence in Gambia) eastwards through Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia (including the vicinity of Mt Nimba; Coe 1975), Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana, where it has also been reported from the north in Mole National Park (Grubb <em>et al.</em> 1998). There is no information from Togo (Kingdon&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013), although Grubb <em>et al.</em> (1998) map older records from Ghana near Fazao-Malfakassa National Park on the border with Togo. The species was previously thought to be found across northern Benin, but may now be restricted to the W and Pendjari National Parks (Akpona and Daouda 2011), although recent surveys have not detected the species there. Sayer and Green (1984) referred to sightings in Burkina Faso and Niger (although the species was not included by Lamarque 2004). The distribution of this species in Nigeria is unclear, but it may occur in the south and was camera-trapped in the southeast in Gashaka Gumti National Park in 2016 (S. Nixon, unpubl. data). It was previously recorded as occurring on the island of Bioko (Kingdon <em>et al.</em> 2013), however these reports are likely of carcasses brought in from the mainland to be sold at market (Hoffmann <em>et al.</em> 2015, Ingram <em>et al.</em> 2019). From the eastern bank of the Sanaga River in Cameroon the species is continuously distributed throughout the Congo Basin into Central Uganda (Kingdon&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). Giant Pangolins have been observed on the lakeshore in western Kenya, close to the Uganda border, although there are no recent records (Kingdon 1971). There is an authenticated record from the Mahale Mountains in western Tanzania, where their presence has been confirmed by camera-traps and they may also occur in Gombe National Park (Foley <em>et al.</em> 2014). There are no records from Burundi (Kingdon&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013) but the presence of the species has recently been confirmed in South Sudan, close to the border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo (D. Reeder, unpubl. data). Although previously thought extirpated in Rwanda the species has recently been confirmed present in the Akagera National Park in the east of the country (D. Bantlin, unpubl. data). The northern limits of the distribution are not well known but can be expected to broadly coincide with the limits of the tropical lowland rainforests and forest savannah mosaics. The northern banks of the Kasai and Tshuapa Rivers apparently define its southern limits within the central forest block (Kingdon&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013).</p><p>  <strong></strong><em></em><u></u><sub></sub><sup></sup><br/></p>","<p>The Giant Pangolin is subject to exploitative threats. Individuals are hunted for their meat, which may be consumed locally or traded as wild meat, and for their scales, which are used for cultural and ethno-medicinal purposes, including in Traditional African Medicine<em> </em>(Bräutigam <em>et al</em>. 1994).</p><p>  </p><p>Hunting for local utilization has historically been the main threat to African pangolins (alongside habitat loss in parts of the range) and while there is limited evidence of international trade within the continent (e.g. Bräutigam <em>et al</em>. 1994, Soewu and Ayodele 2009), it seems likely that not all pangolin derivatives for sale in regional markets are of domestic origin. </p><p>  </p><p>Intercontinental trade of pangolins to Asia, typically for the traditional medicine markets in China and Viet Nam, is a major and rapidly intensifying threat to African pangolins. Large seizures of Giant Pangolin scales totalling 6,115kg, or an estimated 1,697 individuals, have been made in recent years, apparently destined for south east Asia (Challender and Waterman 2017). This species has also been identified in seizures made in Hong Kong (Mwale <em>et al.</em> 2017) and it is highly likely that Giant Pangolin scales were present in the apparently increasing number of seizures involving tropical African pangolins but not identified to species level. The low detection rates associated with illegal wildlife trade and the fact that hunting and poaching is indiscriminate between age and sex, and increasingly targeted for export markets, suggest that documented pangolin seizures comprise only a small fraction of the actual trade, with real volumes likely at unsustainable levels (see Challender and Waterman, 2017).<br/></p>",Terrestrial,"<p>Giant Pangolins are present in protected areas across their range, including in: Cameroon: Campo Ma’an (Matthews and Matthews 2006), Dja Faunal Reserve (Bruce <em>et al.</em> 2018), Lobéké National Park (T.

123584856,12763,Manis javanica,Critically Endangered,A2d+3d+4d,2019,2019-05-02 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>This species is listed as Critically Endangered (A2d+3d+4d). It is inferred that populations have declined by 80% over the past 21 years (three generations, generation length estimated at seven years, i.e. 1998-2019) based on overexploitation from hunting and poaching (A2d). Being precautionary, the species is listed as Critically Endangered (A3d+4d), both looking forward three generations (2019-2040) and looking backward one generations and forward two generations (2012-2033). This is based on very high levels of harvest for commercial trafficking of live and dead individuals, industrially processed frozen pangolins, and scales, seemingly across the species’ range, combined with ongoing exploitation for local use. Quantifying the extent of exploitation spatially is difficult but it seems likely that Singapore and smaller islands (e.g., those surrounding mainland and island Southeast Asia in the species’ range) may be the only localities where overexploitation is not a threat. This predicament is compounded by a number of factors including the likelihood that governance and law enforcement changes on a level needed to prevent the overexploitation of the species are unlikely to occur within three generations time. Additionally, there is currently weak evidence that demand reduction efforts in key consumer countries for Asian pangolin products and derivatives, which theoretically could lead to a reduction in harvest, are effective. Meanwhile, the incentives for harvesting and illegally trading in the species are universally high based on the high financial value of pangolin parts and derivatives.</p>","<p>This species is found in primary and secondary forest, including lowland dipterocarp forest, and cultivated areas – including oil palm and rubber plantations – including and near human settlements (e.g., in gardens; Nowak 1999, Azhar et al. 2013, Chong <em>et al.</em> 2016, Nash <em>et al.</em> 2019). Hunters interviewed in Viet Nam reported that the species is found in a variety of habitats, though areas with primary forest support higher abundances, likely because they contain more older, larger trees with hollows suitable for sleeping and for use as den sites (Newton <em>et al</em>. 2008, see also Lim and Ng 2008) and support lower levels of human activity. While there have been no targeted field studies on abundance and population densities in Singapore, the Sunda Pangolin has persisted for decades without an obvious decline in parts of the city where forest quality is not high (Nash et al. 2019). This is likely due to the lack of strong habitat and diet preferences (Lim 2007) and low levels of hunting/poaching. However, further research is required into habitat utilization and the ability of this species to persist outside primary forest in the long-term. A recent study reported that the Sunda Pangolin was found to be able to utilise boulder cavities as dens in areas of high disturbance in Kelantan, Malaysia (Chong <em>et al.</em> 2016). Similarly, a study in Malaysian Borneo recorded Sunda Pangolins more frequently in modified habitat than primary forest, but it is unclear if this is the result of easier detection rather than being the species being more abundant in this habitat and this requires further research (Davies and Payne 1982).</p>  <p>As with most other species of pangolin, the Sunda Pangolin is primarily nocturnal, solitary – except when breeding – and is a specialized feeder on ants and termites. The species is thought to play a role in regulating insect populations. Lim and Ng (2008) observed that Sunda Pangolins foraged for ant species for 67% of the time versus 33% for termite species. The species also consumes ant larvae, bee pupas, flies, worms, crickets, and other insect larvae, as well as sand and grass (Hua <em>et al.</em> 2015). Sunda Pangolins have an observed preference for Oecophylla ant species (weaver ants), both in the wild and in captivity (Lim, 2007; Nguyen <em>et al.</em> 2014), and for <em>Anoplolepis gracilipes</em> (the Yellow Crazy Ant; Lim 2007). Sunda Pangolins will also eat <em>Crematogaster</em> spp. in captivity (Nguyen <em style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"">et al</em>. 2014), though this species was avoided in the wild in Singapore (Lim 2007).</p>  <p>Sunda Pangolins breed all year round (Lim and Ng 2008, Nguyen <em>et al.</em> 2014, Zhang <em>et al.</em> 2015), although breeding may be seasonal in the northern parts of the species’ range, due to colder temperatures reducing prey activity during the winter months. The species has low fecundity, giving birth to one young after a gestation period of about 6 months (180 days; Nguyen <em>et al. </em>2014, Zhang<em> et al.</em> 2015). Lim and Ng (2008) recorded the activity budget of a radio-tracked female with young and concluded that maternal care following the birth of a single offspring was for approximately three to four months. Challender <em>et al.</em> (2012) witnessed behaviour in captivity concurring with this. Lim and Ng (2008) reported that three natal dens were used, all associated with hollows in large trees (&gt;50 cm diameter at breast height [DBH]); female home-range size was estimated as being 6.97 ha, and daily activity was 127 ± 13.1 minutes (mean&#160;± SE.E), with peak activity between 03h00 and 06h00. Adult male home range based on radio-tracking four individuals was 41.3 ha, daily activity was 165 ± 14 minutes, and 11 genera of ants (67% of diet) were foraged upon (Lim 2007). Lim (2007) observed males displaying territorial behaviour suggesting the species is territorial.</p>  <p>There is little information on mortality rates but it is thought to be high due to indiscriminate poaching, meaning individuals are poached regardless of their age or sex. Further information is needed on survival rates of Sunda Pangolins that are released back into the wild and the impact of releases on resident populations. A number of parasites and diseases have been associated with Sunda Pangolins, some of which can be picked up by trafficked individuals during transportation – pangolin are often kept in poor, unsanitary conditions – therefore there is a risk of transmission between the recently released pangolin and the wild population.</p>  <p>Hunters in Viet Nam consistently reported that the Sunda Pangolin is more arboreal than the Chinese Pangolin (<em>Manis pentadactyla</em>). They are adept climbers and their prehensile tails make excellent climbing aids. They often climb to access ants nests, including weaver ants, in trees (Lim 2007). They sleep in hollows either in, or at the base of, trees, but have also been known to dig burrows in soil and shelter in fallen logs. Females may be dependent on tree hollows around parturition and whilst caring for infants (Lim and Ng 2008). By excavating burrows, as well as ant nests and termite mounds whilst searching for prey, Sunda Pangolins are thought to aerate the soil, facilitating the nutrient cycle, and play an important role in the ecosystem.</p>  <p>The species is also a capable swimmer, like other pangolin species, and appears well adapted to wetland ecosystems e.g., the U Minh wetlands in Viet Nam (Willcox<em> et al. </em>2017). The Sunda Pangolin has also been observed frequenting pools of water when cared for in captivity (Nguyen <em>et al.</em> 2014).</p>","<p>The primary threat to the Sunda Pangolin is overexploitation from hunting and poaching, both targeted and untargeted, for local and international use. The latter is largely driven by demand in China and Viet Nam and associated incentives to supply those markets, and involves industrial quantities of live and dead animals and their meat and scales each year (Wu and Ma 2007, Challender and Waterman 2017, Heinrich <em>et al</em>. 2017). In China and Viet Nam, pangolin meat is consumed as a luxury product in high end urban restaurants (as well as more locally e.g., on the fringes of protected areas in Viet Nam), and the scales are used as an ingredient in traditional medicines to purportedly cure skin ailments, improve blood circulation and stimulate milk secretion in lactating women, as well as to treat other illnesses, including cancer (Yu and Hong 2018). Contemporary trade routes are sophisticated and extensive occurring over land and by sea (Sopyan 2009). Heinrich <em>et al.</em> (2017) studied the global pangolin trade and found a mean of 29 new routes each year between 2010 and 2015. Trafficking today follows a heavy international trade historically. According to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), trade data between 1975 and 2018, trade in this species included ~500,000 animals, which mainly comprised skins that were traded to North America, mainly between 1978 and 2000. However, evidence indicates a heavy, unrecorded, illegal trade involving live animals and scales took place simultaneously, potentially involving an additional 500,000-935,000 Sunda Pangolin (Challender <em>et al.</em> 2015). Challender <em>et al.</em> (2019) estimated that trafficking in Asian pangolins between 2001 and 2018 potentially involved &gt;280,000 individuals, most of which involved this species.<br/></p><p>The pervasive snaring throughout South East Asia (Gray <em>et al</em>. 2017b) means Sunda Pangolins, like all ground-dwelling mammals, are at risk of accidental mortality or injuries in most forests across the region. Local use also comprises a threat, though evidence suggests this is now largely forgone in favour of international trade, given the high monetary value of this species (Newton <em>et al. </em>2008, MacMillan and Nguyen 2013). Hunting and poaching of the Sunda Pangolin may take place to meet subsistence needs and the ultimate driver is absolute or relative poverty, though in some areas poaching appears to be opportunistic and undertaken by hobbyists as well as organised criminal syndicates (Pantel and Anak 2010). It is compounded by the ease with which the species can be captured once found, ineffective and insufficient enforcement in most range states and a lack of resources dedicated to conservation efforts. It is thought that icreasing demand combined with a decreasing supply of Sunda Pangolins has resulted in poaching in areas that were previously considered too costly and inaccessible for hunting.</p><p>This species is known to be harvested for international trade in both live animals and scales in Myanmar, as evidenced by seizures in China (Challender and Waterman 2017). Myanmar, on the basis of its geographic position, size and weak government, has emerged as an important transit country for the smuggling of pangolins to China; although the origin of pangolins is often unclear, trade seems to comprise a mixture of pangolins from Myanmar and neighbouring countries (Nijman <em>et al.</em> 2015). The northern Myanmar region has been identified as a potential transit and source place for the illegal trade of pangolins and their scales (Zhang <em>et al.</em> 2017).<strong></strong><em></em><u></u><sub></sub><sup></sup><br/></p>  <p>The population in the southern part of Thailand has crashed because of trade and in the last few years many pangolins have been confiscated from illegal traders (Challender and Waterman 2017). This species is hunted by specially trained dogs, which can smell it out, making hunting much more effective. Habitat loss, often in the form of deliberate and accidental burning of forests, constitutes a secondary threat to the species here.</p><p>  </p><p></p><p>In Cambodia, the threat to the Sunda Pangolin from hunting and poaching is increasing due to rising prices, and loggers are expending more effort hunting pangolins due to a decrease in luxury wood in the forest (A. Olsson pers. comm. 2013). Pangolins are also often hunted using trained detection dogs and certain villages (e.g., those around Botum Sakor National Park, Koh Kong) are known to specialise in training and deploying such dogs (T. Gray in litt. 2017). In protected areas in the Northern Plains complex, local villagers are financially rewarded for simply reporting pangolin signs to local traders and middlemen (A. Suzuki in litt. 2017).</p>  <p>In Lao PDR, interviews with villagers in the 1990s suggested populations had declined by up to 90% within a decade (i.e., between the 1980s and 1990s; Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1999), though there is a lack of hard data supporting this (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2006). Consequently, trafficking in the last decade (2009-2019) has originated or been exported from Malaysia and Indonesia, and is destined for China, based on seizure data (Challender and Waterman 2017). Both Lao PDR and Thailand play a key role as transit countries in regional trade involving live animals. Lao PDR is being exploited as a low-risk transport hub for illegal wildlife goods, including pangolins. Lao PDR’s weak laws and ineffective enforcement allow pangolins from both Asian and African countries to be shipped through the country and into consumer countries, such as China and Viet Nam. Between 2010 and 2015, Lao PDR was involved in a total of 43 reported trafficking incidents, in which it was either a seizure (2.3%), origin (32.6%), transit (44.2%) or destination country (23.3%). Thirty-three incidents (76.7%) exclusively involved Asian countries (meaning they did not involve African or non-range countries), and accounted for an estimated ~3,015 pangolins. Based on seizure data from (2010-2015), Asian pangolin species are often smuggled from Indonesia or Malaysia into Lao PDR through Thailand and involve both live and dead or frozen pangolins (Gomez <em>et al.</em> 2016, Challender and Waterman 2017).</p>  <p>Eighty-four hunters in Viet Nam were interviewed and every one reported that they now sell all pangolins that they catch (Newton <em>et al.</em> 2008). Prices are so high that local, subsistence use of pangolins, for either meat or their scales, has completely halted in favour of selling to the national or international trade (MacMillan and Nguyen 2013, Nuwer and Bell 2013). The only occasions on which a hunter might eat a pangolin is if it is already dead when they retrieve it from a trap, then they would use the meat and sell the scales (P. Newton, pers. comm.). The price per kg of pangolin, paid to hunters (in Viet Nam at least) escalated rapidly in the decade up to 2007 and since the commercial trafficking in pangolins began to expand in about 1990 (P. Newton pers. comm.). The main threat in Viet Nam remains hunting therefore, including taking pangolins caught as non-target species. This species is in demand in urban centres such as Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City both for meat – a luxury product –&#160; and scales, and which is attributed to increasing affluence following economic reforms in the late 20th century. Viet Nam is a persistent consumer market in Asia for wildlife species and this is a key factor in the decline of the species in Viet Nam and surrounding regions (Shairp <em>et al.</em> 2016). After two decades of rapid economic growth, newly wealthy consumers are purchasing wildlife to advertise their status, including luxury wild meats the price of which is usually associated with the rarity of a species and its wild origins. Pangolins are often the most expensive meat on the menu in Vietnamese restaurants (Challender <em>et al.</em> 2015, Shairp<em> et al.</em> 2016).</p><p>  </p><p></p><p>Malaysia has been experiencing targeted hunting and poaching almost exclusively for international trade in meat and scales in recent years and though this includes foreigners, it mostly involves Malaysian nationals. Reported price increases have acted to create a strong incentive to poach and enter the species into national and international trafficking (Pantel and Anak 2010, Chong <em>et al</em>. 2016). This is attracting poachers from outside the country (J.L. Chong, unpubl. data). Increasing land conversion for palm oil throughout Malaysia has created easy road access for poachers. The longevity of palm oil cycles (i.e. the removal of old palms and the replanting of new, which occurs on average every 25 years, suggests that where this species does persist in these habitats (Chong <em>et al.</em> 2016), it may not be viable in the long term, though further research on such dynamics is needed. Malaysia also plays a key role as a transit country for the movement of pangolins, mostly live individuals and meat, from Indonesia to China (Challender and Waterman 2017).&#160;</p><p>  </p><p></p><p>Indonesia has been illegally exporting large numbers of live pangolins as well as meat, especially since 2000, some of which comes from east Kalimantan (Sopyan 2009). Targeted hunting and poaching is the biggest threat in Indonesia, especially on Sumatra, Kalimantan and Java, as evidenced by seizures involving several thousands pangolins over the last two decades (Pantel and Chin 2009, Sopyan 2009).</p>  <p>In Singapore, roadkill is seemingly the biggest threat to this species and though poaching does occur here, it is not thought to be a significant problem.<strong></strong><em></em><u></u><sub></sub><sup></sup><br/></p><p>Secondary threats include habitat loss, largely driven by commercial operations, such as logging, mining and hydro-power dams, and the construction of roads, which has facilitated hunting and poaching by opening previously inaccessible areas. Across Lao PDR, Cambodia and Indonesia this has occurred even within protected areas. The conversion of primary forest to agricultural land is a major driver of habitat loss. This is particularly common in Malaysia and Thailand with habitat replaced with large-scale oil, rubber and paper and pulp plantations. The severity of the threat from habitat loss is not well understood given the species' ability to survive in modified landscapes. However, the ability of the species to persist long-term in habitats such as oil palm and rubber plantations is unknown and commands research attention.</p>","<p>There are very little quantitative data on Sunda Pangolin populations at any level (local, national or international), with the exception of Singapore (see below). This species is rarely observed, principally because of its increasing rarity, but also because it is secretive, elusive and primarily nocturnal. There is a paucity of research on population densities at all scales (Willcox <em>et al.</em> 2019). However, population declines are inferred in various places based on the knowledge of local community members and indigenous peoples and from shifting trade dynamics, both legal and illegal. For instance pangolins are now being poached in South Asia (India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan (Mahmood <em>et al.</em> 2012, Mohapatra <em>et al.</em> 2015), and Africa to meet demand which has been met from Southeast Asia in recent decades, mainly Malaysia and Indonesia (Challender and Hywood 2012, Gomez et al. 2016, Challender and Waterman 2017, Heinrich <em>et al.</em> 2017), following declines in populations of the Sunda Pangolin in the north of its range and Chinese Pangolin (Zhang 2008, Chong <em>et al.</em> 2019)</p>  <p>This species is now extremely rare in the northern part of its range where there have been massive declines in Indochina (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1999, Nooreen and Claridge 2001). </p>  <p>It is listed as Endangered in Viet Nam (Nguyen, 2007). In three areas of Viet Nam where interviews were conducted (Khe Net Protected Area, Ke Go Nature Reserve and Song Thanh National Park), 95% of hunters believed pangolins populations have declined severely, because of hunting pressure (Newton <em>et al.</em> 2008). Hunters reported that populations had massively declined in the last few decades, but particularly since about 1990, when the commercial trade in pangolins began to escalate (Newton 2007). In all three areas, the species was described as now being extremely rare. The intense biodiversity survey effort and extremely limited number of confirmed records of pangolins throughout Viet Nam's protected areas adds weight to this observation (see Newton <em>et al.</em> 2008). The rarity of the species was highlighted in more recent research in U Minh Thuong National Park (Nuwer and Bell 2013) and Quang Nam Province (MacMillan and Nguyen 2013). </p>  <p>The species was listed as ‘Rare’ in Cambodia in 2003. There are no population estimates for the country but it is suspected the species is in decline. In a number of reserves in the Cardamom Mountains, this species is present but populations are heavily suspected to be declining. This includes the Elephant Mountains, Central Cambodian Lowland Forests (Prey Long), Eastern Plains Landscape, Northern Plains and Northeast Cambodia. Interviews with hunters suggest that the species is absent in some of these areas, which is attributed to hunting (A. Olsson pers. comm. 2013), and it is likely that these declines have continued since this appraisal.&#160;</p>  <p>In three separate areas within the range of the Sunda Pangolin in Lao PDR (Xe Pian, Dong Phou Veng and Khammouan Limestone National Biodiversity Conservation Area [NBCA]), villagers reported in the late 1990s that pangolin populations had declined due to hunting; in some areas, to as little as one percent of numbers 30 years ago, i.e. (since the 1960s; Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1999, Nooren and Claridge 2001). The species has largely been extirpated from the lowlands in Lao PDR and is being exploited where areas that were not previously accessible are opening up due to development, including the expansion of agro-industrial plantations (D. Willcox, pers. comm.). </p>  <p>In Peninsular Malaysia, the species has previously been described as common in some areas, at least up until 1999 (Ickes and Thomas 2003). It was listed as Vulnerable in Peninsular Malaysia in 2012. Azhar <em>et al.</em> (2013) report its presence in oil palm plantations in Selangor and Negri Sembilan, though it is subject to very heavy hunting pressure here. According to Numata <em>et al.</em> (2005) the species is present in Pasoh Forest Reserve. Based on recent camera trap data, the species is also present in the Kenyir Wildlife Corridor (D.W.S. Challender, pers. comms. 2013) and also as roadkill in Kenyir (J.L. Chong, J. L. pers. comm. 2017). However, interviews with hunters and villagers in 2007 and 2011 indicate populations in Peninsular Malaysia are decreasing as a result of hunting pressure for trade (D.W.S. Challender, unpubl. data, J.L. Chong, unpubl. data). This is supported by results of pangolin hunting frequency and patterns of the Orang Asli in Kelantan, Pahang and Terengganu (Chong <em>et al.</em> 2016).&#160;&#160; </p>  <p>In Sabah, the Sunda Pangolin has previously been considered relatively common, but there is little recent data on the species' status here. Populations are under pressure from collection for both local use and international trafficking, which seems to have intensified in recent years, and is inferred to be having a detrimental impact on population levels. For example, Pantel and Anak (2010) report that &gt;22,000 Sunda Pangolin were collected for illicit export in the state in an 18 -month period in Sabah between 2007 and 2009. In February 2019, local authorities seized ~30 tonnes of Sunda Pangolins in Sabah, involving frozen animals, live animals and their skins and scales (Anon 2019).&#160;&#160;</p>  <p>In Sarawak, recent data are lacking, but it is believed that populations are under heavy collection pressure for local use, mostly as Sunda Pangolin meat is favoured as a protein source, but the species is also in trade and it is inferred to be causing a decline in the wild populations (J.L. Chong unpubl. data).&#160; </p>  <p>There is a small population in Singapore that might be stable. A recent estimate put the population in the country at 1068 individuals (D. Fung Yu En, unpubl. data). The species is listed as Critically Endangered in Singapore (Davison <em>et al.,</em> 2008).</p>  <p>There is no recent data on the status of this species in Myanmar; though seizures involving the Sunda Pangolin in China in recent years infer that trade originated in Myanmar, suggesting populations of this species here are under threat (Challender and Waterman 2017). It is thought the Sunda Pangolin has been lost from lowland areas due to hunting and habitat conversion to agricultural land.&#160;&#160; </p>  <p>The Sunda Pangolin is considered threatened and is becoming increasingly rare in Thailand (Bain and Humphrey 1982).<br/></p>  <p>Evidence from seizures involving this species attest that it is present in some numbers in Indonesia (including Sumatra, Java and Kalimantan). However, the magnitude of international trafficking originating from Indonesia in the last decade suggests populations here are, or could be, in severe decline. Stating categorically that this is the case is difficult due to a lack of information on past or present population levels, and warrants further research. The estimated generation length of seven years, the indiscriminate nature of poaching and the magnitude of seized trade supports this assertion (Challender and Waterman 2017). For example, there have been seizures comprising 11, 14 and 17 tonnes of Sunda Pangolins between 2000 and 2013, each of which involved several thousand animals, and which likely comprises only a fraction of the trade, based on low detection rates associated with illegal wildlife trade. In Bali, local people report that thirty years ago pangolins would wander into household gardens around Ubud and central Bali whereas now it is hard to find them. Apparently, the northern parts of Bali have higher abundance but the species is generally very rare (H. Nash, unpubl. data).</p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Sunda Pangolin is widely distributed geographically, occurring across mainland and island Southeast Asia, from central Myanmar south through western, southeasterrn and southern Thailand, lowland Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR), central and southern Viet Nam, Cambodia, Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore. It then occurs on Sumatra, Java and adjacent islands (Indonesia), and Borneo (Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei Darussalam) and surrounding islands. The northern and western limits of its range are poorly known (Schlitter 2005). Wu <em>et al.</em> (2005) note the occurrence of the species in Yunnan Province, southwestern China based on specimens at the Kunming Institute of Zoology, but there is uncertainty over the provenance of these specimens and thereby occurrence of the species in China (Chong <em>et al. </em>2019). Further details on distribution within each range state are provided below. &#160;&#160;</p><p>Altitudinal limits are not well understood, but in the northern part of its range the species probably does not widely occur above 600 m asl (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2006). Moreover, individuals in captivity north of the Sunda Pangolin’s estimated geographic range have high mortality rates, often dying from exposure due to colder temperatures (Carnivore and Pangolin Conservation Program, unpubl. data). On Borneo, the species has been recorded up to 1,700 m asl at Mount Kinabalu (Payne <em>et al.</em> 1985) and there is a specimen in the Natural History Museum in London from 1,500 m asl. from Lombok, Indonesia (P. Newton, unpubl. data). Kaicheen and Mohd-Azlan (2018) recorded the species at &gt;1,200 m in the Mt. Penrissen area, Sarawak. Despite being present in a number of protected areas (PAs - see the Conservation section) across its range, these are mostly located in poorly accessible areas – either they are at high altitudes or they have steep terrains – meaning they offer limited protection for the Sunda Pangolin, as it is mostly found at altitudes below 1,000 m asl in Indochina, Myanmar and Thailand. It is suspected that the species has been extirpated from some lowland areas of Lao PDR, Myanmar and Thailand, and is highly vulnerable in other lowland areas in these countries as well as Cambodia and Viet Nam.</p><p>It appears likely that the detectability of pangolins from conventional large mammal focused camera trapping is low, thus data (or its absence) from camera trap by-catch information may not provide as much value for pangolins as many other species of ground-dwelling mammals in tropical Asia. For example, the Sunda Pangolin was detected from 11 of 65 randomly set-up camera trap stations (across ~8,000 camera trap nights) in the <a name=""_Hlk12368739"">Southern Cardamom National Park, Cambodia</a>, despite no previous records from more than 22,000 camera-trap nights previously in the landscape (Gray <em>et al</em>. 2017a).</p>  <p>This species is distributed in central and southern Myanmar (Salter 1983, Corbet and Hill 1992), but has apparently been eradicated widely from lowland areas due to human agricultural expansion and hunting (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2006). The species has been recorded in the Tanintharyi region in the south (Challender and Waterman 2017). Moo <em>et al.</em> (2017) recorded<em> Manis</em> spp. in Karen State in Myanmar which likely comprises this species. Rao <em>et al.</em> (2005) recorded this species in Hkakborazi National Park in northern Myanmar in the early 2000s but there is uncertainty over the species identification (M. Rao, pers. comm.) and this record may refer to the Chinese Pangolin (<em>Manis pentadactyla</em>)<em>.</em><br/></p><p><em></em>The species historically occurred throughout Thailand (Lekagul and McNeely 1977, Bain and Humphrey 1982), but, like in Myanmar, has reportedly been lost from most of the lowland areas due to agricultural expansion and hunting/poaching (J.W. Duckworth and R. Steinmitz pers. comm. 2006). Camera-trap data confirms the presence of the species in <a name=""_Hlk12368865"">Khao Yai National Park</a> (ZSL 2017) and there are records from Khao Ang Ru Nai Wildlife Sanctuary (Jenks et al., 2012), Kaeng Krachan National Park (W. Sodsai, unpubl. data), Khlong Nakha Wildlife Sanctuary, and the southeastern western forest complex (sWEFCOM) in Kanchanaburi Province (ZSL, 2017), as well as Hala-Bala Wildlife Sanctuary in the far south (Kitamura et al., 2010). The species occurs also on islands e.g., Ko Ra, Phang Nga Province (GVI, unpubl. data).<strong></strong><em></em><u></u><sub></sub><sup></sup><br/></p><p>Recent research suggests the species is present but rare in central and southern Viet Nam (MacMillan and Nguyen 2013, Nuwer and Bell 2013), however records from these areas vary in reliability. There are older records from Kon Tum Province, Tay Ninh Province and Quang Nam Province (Bourret 1942). Meanwhile, there are more recent records (summarised by Newton 2007) from Ha Tinh Province (Timmins and Cuong 1999), Kien Giang and Ca Mau Provinces (in <a name=""_Hlk12372231"">U Minh Thuong National Park</a>) (CARE 2004), Dong Nai, Bin Phuoc and Lam Dong Provinces (<a name=""_Hlk12372258"">Cat Tien National Park</a>) (Murphy and Phan 2001), Quang Binh (Le <em>et al</em>. 1997a), and Dak Lak (Le&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1997b). Recent enforcement activity suggests the species is still present in Dak Nong, Kon Tum, Quang Binh and Gia Lai provinces (L. Fletcher and A. Nguyen, unpubl. data). Based on camera trap data, the species is also present in <a name=""_Hlk12372414"">U Minh Ha National Park </a>(Willcox <em>et al.</em> 2017). Additionally, camera trap records from December 2012 to August 2014 recorded this species in <a name=""_Hlk12372454"">Thua Thien Hue and Quang Nam Saola Reserves in central Vietnam </a>(T. Gray <em>in litt</em>. 2017). The species was recorded in 2013 in Cat Tien National Park (Save Vietnam’s Wildlife, unpubl. data). Surveys using trained detection dogs have recorded the species in Cat Tien National Park and camera-trapping has recorded it in Pu Mat National Park (Save Vietnam’s Wildlife, unpubl. data), though it is unknown whether these were released animals. A Sunda pangolin was observed at night during reptile and amphibian surveys in Pu Mat National Park in 2014 (S. Trageser, pers. comm<em>. </em>2018) and it has been camera-trapped in Bach Ma National Park (A. Wilting, pers. comm. 2017).</p><p>This species was likely widespread in Lao PDR historically. There are records of varying reliability from a wide range of areas below <em>ca</em> 600 m asl. However, it is possible that in Lao PDR the species is restricted to the Mekong plain and adjacent foothills up to <em>c. </em>900 m asl, with a possible occurrence on the Bolaven Plateau, north from <a name=""_Hlk12372677"">Xe Pian National Biodiversity Conservation Area </a>in the south and at least as far north as Nam Kading (Duckworth&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1999, J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2006). Nooren and Claridge (2001) reported that populations in Lao PDR have been severely reduced as a result of hunting for consumption and trade. Camera trap data from Nakai-Nam Thuen in 2016 recorded six instances of pangolins at six different stations, however as the range of the Sunda and Chinese Pangolins overlap here, it was not possible to identify the species (Coudrat 2017).<br/> <br/> In Cambodia, the Sunda Pangolin has been recorded from sea level to 830 m asl (A. Olsson pers. comm. 2012, T. Gray <em>in litt</em>. 2017) and historically occurred throughout deciduous forest, lowland and mountainous evergreen forest, and secondary forest prior to the extensive hunting driven declines that have likely occurred in the past 10-20 years. Extensive recent (meaning post-2012) camera trapping conducted across many of the country’s protected landscapes has generated very few records of this species (though as noted previously, it is difficult to detect pangolins within general large mammal focused camera trapping). For example, there are no post-2008 camera trap records of the Sunda Pangolin from Cambodia’s Eastern Plains Landscape despite more than 100,000 trap nights and a small number (less than five since 2012) of confiscations by law enforcement teams (R. Crouthers, O. Griffin and T. Gray <em>in litt</em>. 2017). However, there have been two records since 2010 from camera trapping in deciduous dipterocarp dominated areas of Preah Vihear Province in the Northern Plains (Songkom Thmey District, May 2017, G. McCann <em>in litt</em>. 2017, and Chep Wildlife Sanctuary (Suzuki <em>et al</em>. 2017) and one from the evergreen forest in Virachey National Park, Rattanakiri, at 830 m asl (McCann and Pawlowski 2017). The Songkom Thmey record was obtained from proactively investigating a “a small tunnel-like game trail” and further emphasises that targeted camera trapping may be necessary to detect the species. There have been more than 10 camera trap records since 2016 from low to mid (10-500 m asl) elevation evergreen forest in the Southern Cardamom National Park and northern Botum Sakor National Park, Koh Kong province (Gray <em>et al</em>. 2017a). It is worth noting that at least two of the recent camera trap records were obtained from small sites managed for ecotourism. This level of intense benign human activity may be necessary to prevent hunting and it is possible that extinction in most of the country’s large, but insufficiently staffed or managed, protected areas is inevitable. It seems likely that numbers in Cambodia are depressed to such a level, particularly in accessible areas of the country, that detection during most biodiversity surveys is unlikely. Nevertheless, the species remains regularly confiscated by law enforcement teams throughout the country, with a total of 375 confiscations by the Wildlife Rapid Rescue Team between 2001 and 2016 (Wildlife Alliance <em>in litt</em>. 2017). Furthermore, between four and five individuals are confiscated annually in the landscape by the Wildlife Alliance law enforcement teams (T. Gray <em>in litt</em>. 2017). Other recent records (for example, there are at least two from central Phnom Penh since 2014) may involve individuals that have escaped from wildlife trade, rather than representing wild animals (T. Gray <em>in litt</em>. 2017).</p>  <p>The species is widely distributed geographically in Peninsular Malaysia, primarily in forest, but also in gardens and plantations, including oil palm and rubber plantations (Medway 1977, Numata <em>et al</em>. 2005). It is also found on the island of Penang. Numata <em>et al. </em>(2005) and Ickes and Thomas (2003) note its presence in oil palm and regenerating lowland dipterocarp forest in and around Pasoh Forest Reserve, where it was previously considered common. The Sunda Pangolin<em> </em>remains&#160;present within oil palm plantations in Selangor and Negri Sembilan, Peninsular Malaysia, based on interviews with plantation workers (Azhar <em>et al.</em> 2013). However, Azhar <em>et al.</em> (2013) also report that in areas where interviews have been conducted, it is in decline from hunting for trade. Additionally, the species is present in Kelantan, Pahang and Terengganu, based on interviews with the Orang Asli hunters (Chong <em>et al</em>. 2016), who also reported that the populations there are decreasing (J.L. Chong pers. comm. 2017). Camera trap data from Kelantan and Terengganu produced just a single record of a Sunda Pangolin, despite an effort of 4,364 and 3,453 nights, respectively (Jambari <em>et al</em>. 2015).</p><p>This species is widely distributed on Borneo, including Sabah and Sarawak in Malaysia. It has been recorded in mixed dipterocarp forest and riverine forest (Azlan and Engkamat 2013), as well as remnant forests in this region (Giman <em style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"">et al. </em>2007).

Panjang, unpubl. dataa). It is rarely seen in Sabah, especially compared to 10 years ago (E. Panjang, unpubl. data). Interviews were conducted with local communities and plantation workers living near Sepilok-Kabili Forest Reserve between 2011-2015 and Lower Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary between 2016-2019.

The species does appear as part of the bushmeat trade in Sarawak, especially in markets in Kuching, Sibu and Kapit (J.L. Chong pers. comm. 2017). Kaicheen and Mohd-Azlan (2018) recorded the species at &gt;1,200 m in the Mt. Penrissen area in 2015-2017.<br/></p><p>The abundance of this species is understood to be low in the peat-swamp forests of east and central Kalimantan, Indonesian Borneo (S. Cheyne pers. comm. 2012), but otherwise has a widespread distribution in Indonesia on Sumatra, Java, Borneo, Kiau and Lingga archipelago, Bangka and Belitung, Nias and Pagi islands, Bali and adjacent islands (Corbet and Hill 1992), as well as the Great Bunguran Islands (Natuna Islands) on the northwest coast of Borneo (Phillips and Phillips 2018).&#160;In Bali, local people report that thirty years ago pangolins would wander into household gardens around Ubud and central Bali, whereas now it is hard to find them. The northern parts of Bali have a slightly higher abundance, but they are very rare today (H. Nash, unpubl. data). There are also records from Tanggamus and Lampung Barat Districts in West Java, where the species was found in secondary forests and plantations, ranging between 360-900 m asl. The species was reported in Brunei Darussalam by Medway (1977), which is supported by the 'rescue' of a small number of individuals in 2013. It is reported to occur in all four districts in Brunei Darussalam: Brunei Muara, Tutong, Kuala Belait and Temburong (Fletcher 2016).</p>  <p>The species is still found in the wild in Singapore and adjacent islands, including Pulau Tekong and potentially, Pulau Ubin (Lim and Ng 2008). Wildlife Reserves Singapore (WRS) receives around 20 wild pangolins per year – over 80% of which have been successfully released back into the wild.&#160;</p>","<p>This species has historically been exploited across its geographic range. This has primarily comprised hunting for local, subsistence level consumption, as a source of protein, as well as other uses, and for international trade in skins, scales and meat (Harrisson and Loh 1965, Anon 1992, 1999, Challender <em>et al.</em> 2015, Hafiz and Chong, 2016). There were high levels of international trade in skins from across the species' range in the 1970-1990s, most of which were destined for the United States and Mexico for the manufacture and sale of leather goods including boots, shoes and handbags among other leather items (Anon 1999, Challender <em>et al.</em> 2015, Heinrich <em>et al.</em> 2016), while the scales have been used, either in whole or powdered form, as an ingredient in traditional Chinese and Vietnamese medicine, and in other medicines (Anon 1992, 1999). Other uses include for ritualistic and spiritual purposes, such as protection against bad omens (Anon 1992).</p><p>Most trade reported to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) up to the year 2000 involved skins and scales (Challender <em>et al.</em> 2015, Heinrich <em>et al.</em> 2016), but there was also a parallel illegal trade involving substantial numbers of this species comprising a combination of live animals and scales for consumptive purposes that was principally destined to mainland China (live animals) and China, Taiwan (Province of China) and South Korea (scales; Anon 1992, 1999, Li and Li 1998, Wu and Ma 2007, Challender <em>et al</em>. 2015). In the year 2000, CITES introduced zero export quotas for wild-caught Sunda Pangolins traded for commercial purposes (essentially a proxy trade ban). Despite this measure there has been an ongoing illicit trade in industrial volumes of live and dead Sunda Pangolins and their scales since, which culminated in the species being included in CITES Appendix I at CoP17 in 2016. Challender <em>et al</em>. (2015) estimate that this trade may have involved more than 200,000 Sunda Pangolins exported from Southeast Asia and mainly destined for China and Viet Nam (see also Challender and Waterman 2017). In China and Viet Nam pangolin meat is consumed conspicuously as a luxury dish and scales are used in traditional medicines (Shairp <em>et al. </em>2016, Xu <em>et al.</em> 2016). Legislation prohibits the consumption of pangolin meat in China and Viet Nam, and scales in Viet Nam. In China, there is a legal market for pangolin scales which is regulated by the government. Although official Chinese pharmacopeia prescribe scales from the Chinese Pangolin (<em>Manis pentadactyla</em>), Sunda Pangolins are used in traditional medicines in the country (see Challender<em> et al.</em> 2019). Prices for pangolin meat and scales in China and Viet Nam appear to have risen in recent years, plausibly due to a combination of the increasing rarity of Chinese and Sunda Pangolins, increasing demand and the risk to vendors of selling illegal products (Newton <em>et al.</em> 2008, Challender <em>et al. </em>2015). A study on illegal trade in China suggested that illegal in trade in pangolins is considered easier than other wildlife products, such as ivory and rhino horn, because the products are small and easy to conceal, and is high-profit but apparently low-risk. In many parts of the Sunda Pangolin's range it is understood that traditional, subsistence use of pangolins and their products has been replaced by international trade due to the high financial value of pangolin derivatives (MacMillan and Nguyen 2013, Nuwer and Bell 2013).&#160;</p><p>Other markets for illegal pangolin products also exist. The United States has recently been identified as an end-use market for pangolin products (Heinrich <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p><p>Although dated, Martin and Phipps (1996) noted Sunda Pangolin meat, scales and blood for sale in a restaurant in Cambodia. This practice continues today largely for Chinese expats and tourists (T. Gray in litt. 2017). Research suggests that animals caught in Cambodia are traded across the border to meet demand for luxury meat and scales in Viet Nam (D.W.S. Challender, unpubl. data). However, there have been a number of recent trade confiscations of the Sunda Pangolin on the Thailand-Cambodian border, originating from Thailand (Wildlife Alliance in litt. 2017), suggesting Cambodia may also be a transit or demand country for pangolin. Sunda Pangolins are also sourced in Cambodia and demand exists, particularly from Chinese restaurants in the country (Gray <em>et al.</em> 2017b). </p>  <p>Lao PDR and Thailand both play key roles in illegal trade in live animals and scales from Southeast Asia to East Asia (Gomez <em>et al.</em> 2016). Trade routes typically follow Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand-Lao PDR-China/Viet Nam. Market observations in recent years within the northern regions of Lao PDR revealed an open trade in pangolin scales mostly for use in traditional medicine and to a lesser extent as jewellery (Gomez <em>et al.</em> 2016).</p><p>It is understood pangolin scales, as well as live animals, are sourced from Myanmar for international trade to China (Nijman <em>et al.</em> 2016). Surveys in Mong La, Myanmar, revealed open trade in pangolin scales, skins, live pangolins and pangolin carcasses, including foetuses emerged in wine, which were observed at the central market, specialised wildlife shops, and in front of the restaurants and casinos. The pangolins and their derivatives are believed to be sourced locally, as well as from neighbouring countries (Nijman <em>et al.</em> 2016 ).</p><p>In Malaysia, the scales of this species have been used in the belief that they cure asthma (CITES 2000) and provide protection from spirits (Hafiz and Chong, 2016). However, as above, there is evidence of heavy illicit, international trade in live animals and their scales from both Peninsular Malaysia and Malaysian Borneo, largely to East Asia (Pantel and Anak 2010, Challender and Waterman 2017). In Sabah in 2016, wildlife rangers seized 25 live pangolins after they arrested a local man at a roadblock in Lahad Datu: the Sabah Wildlife Department believed these pangolins were poached from a nearby forest in Lahad Datu (New Strait Times, 2016). The Orang Asli from the Krau Wildlife Reserve in Malaysia will not consume pangolins as they believe the species is an incarnation of the human placenta, and as such, it is taboo to consume it (Hafiz and Chong, 2016). Similarly, the Orang Asli in Pos Pulat, Kelantan, and Sungai Berua, Terengganu, will burn dried pangolin scales to drive away elephants and other wild animals in the jungle (Hafiz and Chong, 2016). The Kadazans in Sabah will use dried pangolin scales to deter crocodiles while in the river (J.L. Chong, unpubl. data). For the Ibans in Sarawak, the scales of the pangolin inspired the pattern called ‘tisik tenggilling’ utilised in the ketapu rotan, which is a helmet type of hat made from coarsely plaited rattan commonly used as part of the Iban cultural dress (J.L. Chong, unpubl. data). Around 50-100 years ago, indigenous people of Sabah (e.g. Kadazan, Dusun, Murut and Rungus) used Sunda Pangolin scales to make vests for their warriors, and for belts to cure arthritis (E. Panjang, unpubl. data). In Sabah, indigenous people who are non-Muslim consume pangolin meat, which they claim cures illnesses like asthma, and drink pangolin blood, which they regard as a tonic. However, because of the high prices offered by middle men, people frequently choose to sell pangolins rather than consume them (E. Panjang, unpubl. data)</p><p>In Indonesia, this species continues to be hunted for local, subsistence use in central and eastern Kalimantan (S. Cheyne pers. comm. 2013, Wirdadeti and Nash, pers. comm. 2016). Practitioners of traditional medicine in Indonesia continue to recommend pangolin scale products for heart conditions and skin disorders (H. Nash, unpubl. data). However, there is voluminous, illicit trade in the animals from Indonesia, largely from Sumatra, and primarily to China and Viet Nam (Pantel and Chin 2009, Challender and Waterman 2017). There is evidence of professional, commercial-scale hunting of the species both in Sumatra, and more widely in Indonesia, solely for the purpose of commercial but illegal international trade (Takandjiti and Sawitri 2016). While this largely involved pangolin skins prior to 2000, for the leather trade to North America (Heinrich <em>et al.</em> 2016), in the last two decades it has involved live animals, their scales and pangolin meat, and which has primarily been destined for China and Viet Nam (Sopyan 2009, Takandjiti and Sawitri 2016, Challender and Waterman 2017).<br/></p>",Terrestrial,"<p>The Sunda Pangolin is protected by legislation in virtually all its range states, being listed as a protected or totally protected which typically prohibits exploitation. There may be customary laws which permit indigenous peoples to exploit the species for subsistence purposes in some range states (e.g. Malaysia). Exceptions include Brunei Darussalam where the species is not specifically listed as protected but does receive protection under broader wildlife and forestry legislation. In China, the species is a State Category II protected species. </p>  <p>The species occurs in a number of protected areas across its range including Cambodia: Chep (Suzuki <em>et al</em>. 2017) and Pream Krasop Wildlife Sanctuaries (McCann and Pawlowski 2017), Southern Cardamom (Gray <em>et al.</em> 2017a), Virachey and Botum Sakor National Parks; Thailand: Khao Yai and Kaeng Krachan National Parks (W.

123585768,12765,Smutsia temminckii,Vulnerable,A4cd,2019,2019-05-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>Temminck's Pangolin is listed as Vulnerable under criteria A4cd because there is an inferred past/ongoing and future population reduction of 30–40% over a 45 year period (15 years past, 30 years future; generation length estimated at 15 years) based primarily on ongoing exploitation for traditional medicine and bushmeat throughout the species' range and evidence of increased intercontinental trade to Asia. True rates of decline are imperfectly known but are unlikely to exceed 50%. The assessors have chosen to take a precautionary approach in listing the species as Vulnerable, especially considering the burgeoning demand for pangolins in the Asian markets, the resultant severe declines in some Asian pangolin populations and more recently plausible declines in at least two African pangolin species and the unquantified levels of both local and international trade (although both are known to be increasing). The growing human population is also increasingly restricting this species to protected areas through a combination of direct persecution and habitat transformation, with a simultaneous decrease in the Area of Occupancy. Further research into the levels of trade and status of this species is urgently required.</p>","This is a predominantly solitary, terrestrial species that inhabits mainly savannas and woodlands in low-lying regions with moderate to dense scrub where average annual rainfall is between 250 mm and 1,400 mm. Also occurs in floodplain grassland, rocky slopes and sandveld up to 1,700 m asl (Coulson 1989, Pietersen 2013, Swart 2013), but does not inhabit forest or true desert. It occurs widely on well-managed livestock farms where it is afforded protection from human persecution, but is absent from croplands and human settlements. <br/><br/>Temminck's Pangolins are largely water independent but will drink from free-standing water when it is available (Stuart 1980, D. Pietersen, unpubl. data). The most important habitat requirements are believed to be a sufficient population of the various ant and termite prey species and the availability of dens or above-ground debris in which to shelter. Ambient temperatures and annual temperature fluctuations are likely also important governing factors as these directly affect the prey species, while pangolins also have poor thermoregulatory capabilities and appear to rely on environmental conditions for thermoregulation (Pietersen 2013).<br/><br/>The female gives birth to a single young (rarely twins) after a gestation period of 105–140 days (van Ee 1966, D.W. Pietersen unpubl. data, R, Jansen, unpubl. data). Based on the gestation period, the observed time that it takes the female to regain her pre-parturition condition and field observations on the frequency of births, it is suspected that females may only give birth every second year. Adults come together briefly to mate and the offspring typically remains with the mother for 3–6 months, though this appears to vary somewhat with region (Pietersen <em>et al</em>. 2014, W. Panaino unpubl. data). Young start dispersing when about one year old (Pietersen <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>There are very few data on the longevity of any pangolin species in the wild, making estimates of generation length difficult. Two Indian Pangolins (<em>Manis crassicaudata</em>), which have a similar ecology and are of a similar size to Temminck’s Pangolin, lived for 12 and 19 years, respectively, in captivity (Hoyt 1987; Weigl, 2005). Considering that captive pangolins usually show a greatly attenuated lifespan (Hoyt 1987, Hua <em>et al</em>. 2015), these lifespans are probably minimum estimates. Based on available growth rates, the relative late onset of the start of reproduction, the slow reproductive rate (on average one young per year, perhaps only every second year), and longevity of the sympatric Aardvark (<em>Orycteropus afer</em>), which has a similar ecology and life history, Temminck’s Pangolins are expected to be relatively long-lived, probably surviving for 20 years or more in the wild (D.W. Pietersen and L. Hywood, unpubl. data).","Although present in a number of protected areas across their range and protected by law in all range states (though not included as a protected species in all range states), it is inferred that Temminck's Pangolin numbers are declining due to an increasing demand for their body parts, including scales, for local and international use for medicinal purposes and superstitious value (Coulson 1985, Cunningham and Zondi 1991, Bräutigam <em>et al</em>. 1994, Whiting<em> et al</em>. 2011, Swart 2013, Xu <em>et al</em>. 2016, Baiyewu <em>et al</em>. 2018). Over-exploitation of Temminck's Pangolin for medicinal use is occurring in South Africa and elsewhere throughout its range, and is increasingly focused on core conservation areas (Cunningham and Zondi 1991, Baiyewu <em>et al</em>. 2018). <br/><br/>There has been a sharp increase in the number of individuals that have been seized from illegal trade since 2010 (APWG unpubl. data, Tikki Hywood Foundation unpubl. data). Although the final market for these individuals is unknown, the majority were confiscated in rural areas suggesting local use, although some were confiscated in ports and high-end suburbs suggesting that at least some individuals are likely destined for international markets or for local consumption, potentially by foreigners. This is further supported by large shipments of scales being exported from East Africa to Asia (Xu <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/>A number of seizures of African pangolins or their body parts in Asia (or en route to Asia) provide evidence of an intercontinental trade in African pangolins to Asian markets (Challender and Hywood 2012, Xu <em>et al</em>. 2016, Cheng <em>et al</em>. 2017, Heinrich <em>et al</em>. 2017). The demand for, and price of, pangolin products in Asia appears to be increasing, and traffickers are turning their attention to the African species. As syndicates smuggling pangolins (and rhino horn and ivory) from Africa to Asia become ever more sophisticated and as the Asian pangolin numbers dwindle, so African pangolin species have become more important as source populations for the Asian markets.<br/>Across its range Temminck’s Pangolin is increasingly threatened by shifting agriculture, small-holder farming and agro-industry farming. These farming practices are directly impacting pangolins through habitat loss and alteration, while the increased human presence in these previously undisturbed areas is resulting in increased levels of poaching. Nomadic grazing is also having a negative impact on Temminck’s Pangolins across their range as a result of increased levels of poaching. In Zimbabwe, and likely in other parts of this species’ range, artisanal mining is negatively impacting pangolins and other wildlife species. Artisanal mining results in the creation of deep mining pits which are invariably abandoned once the mineral reserves are depleted. These pits are left uncovered and form lethal pitfall traps into which various animals fall and cannot escape. Artisanal mining also affects pangolins through increased rates of poaching and habitat destruction, while a lot of these mining activities (especially in Zimbabwe) occur within the borders of National Parks and other protected areas.<br/>Temminck's Pangolins are regularly electrocuted on the lower strands of electrified fences in South Africa in particular (Beck 2008, Pietersen <em>et al</em>. 2014), but also throughout their range where electrified fences are prevalent. The mortality rate for South Africa is estimated at 2–13% of the total population per annum (Pietersen <em>et al</em>. 2016). Fencing is becoming more prevalent across this species’ range, and although not all of these fences are electrified, these fences are likely to become more prevalent and more widespread. Road mortalities are also having a negative impact on the species (Coulson 1989, Pietersen <em>et al</em>. 2014). In South Africa and Namibia accidental bycatch of Temminck’s Pangolins in gin traps that have been set for other species is also a threat, while in Zimbabwe substantial habitat alteration and loss of protected areas due to changes in the land use systems since independence has further impacted populations (L. Hywood, unpubl. data). Elsewhere in Africa local and international trade and habitat loss are the main threats, although reports of accidental electrocutions are increasingly reported from across the species’ range (L. Hywood, E. Connelly and D.W. Pietersen, unpubl. data).","<p>In the eastern Lowveld of South Africa Temminck's Pangolins have an estimated breeding density of 0.12 individuals/km² and an estimated total density of 0.24 individuals/km² (Swart 2013). In the Northern Cape Province of South Africa, densities have been calculated at 0.16 reproductively active individuals/km² and overall densities at 0.23 individuals/km² (Pietersen <em>et al</em>. 2014). In the Gokwe district of Zimbabwe they had an estimated overall density of 0.11 individuals/km² (Heath and Coulson 1997, Pietersen <em>et al</em>. 2014); however populations in Zimbabwe are thought to have decreased since this time (L. Hywood and E. Connelly, unpubl. data). South Africa is estimated to have 16,329–24,102 mature individuals (Pietersen <em>et al</em>. 2016) but abundances in other regions of Africa are unknown.</p>",Decreasing,"The most widespread African pangolin species, recorded from southeastern Chad, through South Sudan, much of East Africa and southern Africa as far south as the Northern Cape, North-West and northeast KwaZulu-Natal Provinces of South Africa (Swart 2013, Pietersen <em>et al.</em> 2016), with the western limits of its range being reached in Namibia and southern Angola. The northern limits of the distribution are not well defined, although the species has been recorded from extreme northeastern Central African Republic, southeastern Chad and South Sudan (Swart 2013, APWG unpubl. data). They are also confirmed from the Omo River basin region of southwest Ethiopia and so probably do occur, marginally, in the western border regions of Ethiopia (Swart 2013). Their presence in Somalia is doubtful (Swart 2013). Records from West Africa undoubtedly refer to the Giant Pangolin (<em>Smutsia gigantea</em>; see Grubb <em>et al</em>. 1998). The species may have been extirpated in eSwatini (Pietersen <em>et al.</em> 2016)","The species is eaten as bushmeat to various extents across its range (for example in South Africa, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Mozambique and Tanzania), although its use as bushmeat appears to be limited. Of greater threat is overexploitation for body parts and scales which have superstitious and spiritual value and which are extensively used for medicinal purposes (Cunningham and Zondi 1991, Bräutigam <em>et al</em>. 2004, Setlalekgomo 2014, Baiyewu <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>In Tanzania, Temminck’s Pangolins are sometimes referred to as <em>Bwana mganga</em> ('the doctor') because every part is believed to have some medicinal value (Wright 1954). Many East African people believe that burning pangolin scales keeps lions away (Kingdon 1971). Across their range the scales are widely believed to bring good luck and to bring rain, while smoke from burning scales is said to improve the health of cattle and cure persistent nose-bleeds. The amaZulu believe that seeing a pangolin indicates that there will be a drought, and the only way to prevent the drought is by killing the animal (Kyle 2000). Scales are also used as talismans and in traditional dress (Kyle 2000, Manwa and Ndamba 2011).<br/>In Zimbabwe it is traditionally a good omen to catch and present a pangolin to a superior such as a local chief (Coulson 1985) and 25 individuals were reportedly captured and presented to the Zimbabwean president and other authority figures at the onset of majority rule in Zimbabwe. <br/><br/>Between 2008 and 2018 more than 100 Temminck’s Pangolins were seized in Africa, each comprising one individual (Challender <em>et al.</em> 2019). In South Africa, trade has increased dramatically with 10 individuals seized in 2016, 16 in 2017 and 43 in 2018 (APWG unpubl. data). In addition to local use, there is increasing evidence that at least some of the trade is destined for international markets (Challender and Hywood 2012, Xu <em>et al</em>. 2016).",Terrestrial,"Although locally extirpated in some areas (e.g., parts of South Africa - see Pietersen <em>et al.</em> 2016), Temminck's Pangolins occur in many national parks and other protected areas (e.g. Kruger National Park, South Africa). While it is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and is afforded at least some legislative protection in all range states, there is a need to improve protective legislation and facilitate capacity development to enforce this legislation over much of its range. Projects are needed to determine current population densities and rates of population decline through anthropogenic influences. These should be coupled with research into the scale of both local and intercontinental trade in this species. Mitigation measures are also required to reduce the number of pangolins that are electrocuted on electrified fences.",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

The Black-bellied Pangolin also meets criteria A4cd using a period of 21 years (14 years past, 7 years future) because it is inferred that suitable habitat has been lost in the last 14 years, and will continue to be so, while populations have been and are expected to continue to be hunted (and it is suspected much hunting is unsustainable), resulting in declines of 30-40%. Anthropogenic activities, such as mining and logging, may also exacerbate the situation as they increase accessibility to previously inaccessible areas for hunting and poaching.</p><p>  </p><p>For both threats, the risk and rate of loss is likely different between West and Central Africa, noting that higher levels of habitat loss and human population growth in West Africa has resulted not only in proportionally higher rates of decline in this region (likely &gt; 50%), but also proportionally greater losses into the future. West Africa has deforestation rates that are three times higher than in the Congo basin forests, has higher human population densities, and smaller patches of roadless areas. In the future, differing regional assessments may be necessary to more accurately reflect the status of Black-bellied Pangolin populations. </p><p>  </p><p>A generation length of 7 years has been used for this assessment. This is based on inferences of age at first reproduction in the wild in Asian pangolins of about 2 years, and an assumption of a 10-year reproductive period (2 + [0.5*10]). However, it should be noted that there is a great deal of uncertainty surrounding this estimate and further research into the life history of the Black-bellied Pangolin is needed to make a more informed estimate of generation length.</p><p>  <strong></strong><em></em><u></u><sub></sub><sup></sup><br/></p><p><strong></strong><em></em><u></u><sub></sub><sup></sup><br/></p>","<p>Specific studies documenting habitat use by Black-bellied Pangolins are limited. This species is the most arboreal of the African pangolin species. They are often found in riparian and swamp forests, typically in habitats dominated by palms (including rattans) and specialized swamp trees, such as <em>Uapaca </em>spp., <em>Pseudospondis </em>spp.<em> </em>and <em>Mitragina </em>spp<em>.</em> (Gaubert 2011, Happold 1987, Kingdon and Hoffmann 2013), as well as in primary forests and forest-savannah mosaic. In the more northern parts of their distribution, they occur in dry Guinean forests lacking palms and in the forest regions of Côte d’Ivoire and Nigeria this species has been recorded in degraded forest habitats, farmlands, and plantations (Angelici <em>et al</em>. 1999, Luiselli <em>et al</em>.<em></em> 2015, Sodeinde and Adedipe 1994). This suggests some flexibility in habitat requirements, although it remains unknown if Black-bellied Pangolins can breed in these transformed habitats or whether they act as population sinks.</p>  <p>Individuals sleep in tree hollows or hollowed-out insect nests, and feed on ants and termites that live in tree tops above the flood-line. The gestation period is about 140 days, after which the female gives birth to a single young. Breeding is believed to be aseasonal and almost continuous (Kingdon and Hoffmann 2013).</p><p><br/></p>","<p></p><p>This species is threatened by hunting for the local, and increasingly international, traditional medicine and bushmeat markets. Ingram <em>et al.</em> (2018) estimate that 0.4–2.7 million pangolins are hunted each year in Central African forests and that this number has increased by 150% over the past four decades. Although no formal evaluation has yet to be made, the majority of these are believed to be White-bellied Pangolins (<em>P. tricuspis</em>). The 2.3-fold increase in the price of <em>Phataginus spp.</em> between 1990 and 2015 across urban markets in Central and West Africa (Ingram <em>et al. </em>2018) may indicate an increase in demand and/or that arboreal species have become harder to obtain.</p>  <p>The species has been reported in international trade (Bräutigam&#160;<em>et al.</em> 1994, Chaber <em>et al. </em>2010, Mwale <em>et al.</em> 2017, Heinrich <em>et al</em>. 2017, Ingram <em>et al</em>. 2019). According to CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) trade reports for the period 1996–2011, trade in live animals, specimens or skins is reported in nearly every year, with 40 specimens exported from the Central African Republic in 2000 (<u><a href=""http://www.cites.org/"">www.cites.org</a></u>).&#160;As with other African pangolin species, exploitation of black-bellied pangolins for Asian markets is believed to be increasing (Challender and Waterman 2017). The species is included in international trafficking to Asian markets: it is estimated that between 2015 and 2019 &gt;400,000 African pangolins were seized either in Africa bound for Asia, or in Asia (Challender<em> et al.</em> 2019; D. Challender, unpubl. data).&#160;</p>  <p><em></em>Hunters in Gabon report that Asian industry workers requested meat from all three pangolin species in Gabon (including <span class=""msoIns"">Black-bellied Pangolins). Pangolins were sought after more than any other species (Mambeya <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Habitat loss is also a threat. Past and present declines in pangolin area of occupancy (AOO) and habitat quality likely differ between West and Central Africa. West Africa had deforestation rates of 0.9% between 1990 and 2000 and 0.3% between 2000 and 2010 (Mayaux <em>et al.</em> 2013). In 2018, the Democratic Republic of the Congo had the second highest loss of tropical primary forest in the world, and Ghana and Cote d’Ivoire ranked 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> in terms of their percent increase in loss from 2017 at 60% and 26% respectively (of countries with &gt;100,000 ha of primary forest; World Resources Institute 2019). West Africa also presently has higher human population densities (Tatem 2017), and smaller patches of roadless areas (Ibisch <em>et al. </em>2016). Annual deforestation is higher in areas with higher human population density (Mayaux <em>et al</em>. 2013), however true rates of decline are imperfectly known. Evidence of a general drying trend, particularly in the upper Congolese forests (Zhou<em> et al.</em> 2014), may exacerbate the situation through possible changes in vegetation species composition and structure that may result in decreased habitat suitability for Black-bellied Pangolins.</p>","<p>There are no formal quantitative data available on densities or abundance. This is the least frequently recorded of all the African pangolin species, possibly reflecting its occurrence in little-penetrated habitats and/or reflecting its rare nature and low densities. Preliminary research on the ecology of this species in Côte d’Ivoire suggests a density of ~0.015 individuals/ha in a swamp forest habitat with a low, but constant, level of subsistence hunting pressure, with capture rates in more access-restricted sections suggesting that they may occur at higher densities ( ~0.26 individuals/ha; M. Shirley and B.G.-M. Assovi, unpubl. data).</p>  <p>The occurrence of Black-bellied Pangolins in hunters catch records, and bushmeat and traditional medicine markets has been used as an indicator of occurrence in some of the range countries (e.g., Ghana; Boakye <em>et al.</em> 2016). However, presence in markets may not be a good indicator of status in the wild, even in proximal natural habitats (e.g. Akani <em>et al</em>. 2015). In a survey of 200 local hunters, wildlife vendors, and community leaders in Lagos, Nigeria, Akeredolu <em>et al. </em>(2018) found that 70% believe wild pangolin populations to be declining but did not distinguish between species.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>  </p><p><br/></p>",Decreasing,"<p>This species occurs in the forested regions of West and Central Africa from Sierra Leone eastwards through south-eastern Guinea (Barrie and Kanté 2006), Liberia, Côte d’Ivoire and southwest Ghana (Grubb <em>et al</em>. 1998), after which there is an apparent gap in distribution until west Nigeria. Its presence in Nigeria is probably underestimated because of possible confusion with the white-bellied pangolin (<em>Phataginus tricuspis</em>) (Angelici <em>et al.</em> 1999, Kingdon and Hoffmann 2013). The species then occurs eastwards through southern Cameroon, and much of the Congo Basin forest block with the limits being south-western Central African Republic in the north, eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the southern limits in Gabon and Republic of Congo. It is also suspected to occur in the Semuliki National Park in western Uganda; Kityo <em>et al</em>. 2016), and possibly in Cabinda, Angola (Kingdon and Hoffmann 2013, Gudehus <em>et al.</em> 2019).&#160;</p><p><br/></p><p></p>","<p>This species is hunted for its meat which ranks highly in wild meat preference studies - many of which group the species with the White-bellied Pangolin (e.g., Anadu <em>et al.</em> 1988). The meat is also found in wild meat (bushmeat) markets (e.g. Akani<em> et al</em>. 2015, Ingram<em> et al.</em> 2018). Various body parts of pangolins are also used for cultural and ethno-medicinal purposes, including in traditional African medicine (<em>muti </em>or <em>juju;</em> Bräutigam <em>et al.&#160;</em>1994; Angelici <em>et al</em>. 1999; Boakye <em>et al</em>. 2014, 2015). Across all pangolin species that occur in Ghana and Sierra Leone, Boakye <em>et al.</em> (2014, 2015) identified 13 pangolin body parts that were used to treat health problems in Ghana and 22 pangolin body parts that were used to treat 59 different health problems in Sierra Leone. Boakye <em>et al</em>. (2016) interviewed traders in Ghana and found that out of 341 pangolins (carcasses and live animals) traded by farmer-hunters, chopbar operators, and wholesalers between September 2013 and January 2014, 18% were Black-bellied Pangolins. Of the 98 pangolins physically observed, 18% were Black-bellied Pangolins, and 82% were White-bellied Pangolins (<em>P. tricuspis</em>). Quantities hunted or sold at markets are difficult to determine as many studies group White-bellied and Black-bellied Pangolins together (Ingram <em>et al. </em>2018). </p><p>The scales of African pangolins are also increasingly trafficked internationally, primarily to Asian markets, based on seizure data (Challender and Waterman 2017, Ingram <em>et al.</em> 2019). To date, a single effort has evaluated the proportion of trafficked scales from different species - finding that, out of 2.01 tons of classifiable scales confiscated in Côte d’Ivoire (original seizures of 3.6 tonnes), only 11% were attributable to Black-bellied Pangolins (M.H. Shirley, unpubl. data). It is unclear whether this will remain consistent from seizure to seizure.</p><p>Increasing trafficking of African pangolin scales to Asia is suspected to be driven by declines in Asian pangolins and increasing numbers of African countries are being implicated in international pangolin trafficking (Heinrich <em>et al. </em>2016, 2017). Several large shipments of scales seized in Asia in recent years have originated from Africa (Challender and Waterman 2017; Ingram et al. 2019), for example three shipments totalling 12.3 tonnes in Hong Kong SAR and China from Nigeria (2015-2017), four tonnes in Hong Kong SAR from Cameroon in 2016, three tonnes in Hong Kong SAR from Uganda in 2014 and 712 kg in Malaysia from Ghana and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Challender and Waterman 2017). Of all large-quantity pangolin scale shipments (weighing 1,000 kg or more) between 2010–2015, 55% were found to originate in Africa. Large-quantity shipments accounted for 60% of all scales traded. These significant shipments increased in frequency and weight through time (Heinrich <em>et al.</em> 2017). Recent large seizures include 3 tonnes of scales in a single batch in Côte d’Ivoire in 2016 (Ingram <em>et al</em>. 2019), and two seizures of over 12 tonnes in Singapore in 2019, from Nigeria, <em>en route</em> to Vietnam (Liu 2019).</p><p>In addition, four Black-bellied Pangolin skulls and 10 skeletons were imported to the USA from Cameroon between 1999 and 2017 (Challender and Waterman 2017). In June 2008, five Black-bellied Pangolin specimens originating from the Central African Republic were seized in Paris (Chaber <em>et al. </em>2010).&#160;Legal imports of this species totalled 248 live animals between 1990 and 2015, the majority of which are accounted for in a reported import of 200 individuals to China from Nigeria in 2015 for captive-breeding purposes. There are distinct differences in the numbers of reported imports and exports; for the same period (1990–2015) only 87 Black-bellied Pangolins were recorded to have been exported (Challender and Waterman 2017).&#160;</p><p></p>",Terrestrial,"<p></p><p>Black-bellied Pangolins are present in a number of protected areas (see below), and are likely present in most protected areas with suitable habitat.&#160;The species is found in a number of protected areas, including Ituri Forest Reserve, DRC, Dzanga-Sangha National Park, Central African Republic, Comoe National Park, Côte d’Ivoire, and potentially Semuliki National Park, Uganda but this requires verification. The species is protected by national legislation in most range states; in Gabon and Sierra Leone it is legal to hunt and trade both <em>Phataginus sp. </em>within defined seasons and under certain other criteria, none of which are virtually ever met by local hunters. While the species is included in CITES Appendix I, there is a need to enforce protective legislation in most range states, including raising awareness of the plight of this species amongst national authorities and border control agents.&#160;Research into the population status and trends of this little-known species and an assessment of its ability to withstand both current levels of hunting pressure and habitat modification are needed.&#160;</p><p><br/></p>  <strong></strong><em></em><u></u><sub></sub><sup></sup><br/><p></p>",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

It is estimated that between 2015 and July 2019 scales from the estimated equivalent of &gt;400,000 African pangolins were seized en route to Asian markets (Challender <em>et al</em>. 2019, D. Challender, unpubl. data).</p>  <p>It is inferred that populations could decline by up to 50% over a period of 21 years (three generations), looking back one generation and forward two generations (2012–2033). The assessors were comfortable looking forward two generations based on the following: inferred declines are based on a combination of past and ongoing forest loss in West and Central Africa, while the rate of exploitation of tropical African pangolins is increasing both for local use and consumption (Ingram <em>et al.</em> 2018), and ostensibly for intercontinental trafficking of scales to Asia, including targeting of this species for its scales for export. These dynamics are compounded by the likelihood that governance and law enforcement changes on a level needed to prevent the overexploitation of the species are unlikely to occur within two generations time; there is increasing Chinese investment in West and Central Africa which is apparently facilitating trafficking; there is currently weak evidence that demand reduction efforts in key consumer countries for African pangolin derivatives will be effective, which theoretically could lead to a reduction in harvest; and the population of sub-Saharan Africa is expected to double by 2050 with the largest increases in countries including DRC and Nigeria (United Nations, 2019) thereby placing greater pressure on populations of this species.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>","This species occurs predominantly in moist tropical lowland forests and secondary growth, but also occurs in dense woodlands, especially along water courses (Kingdon 1971; Gaubert 2014).&#160;Sodeinde and Adedipe (1994) noted that White-bellied Pangolins were often caught in abandoned or little-used oil palm (<em>Elaeis guineensis</em>) plantations in secondary growth.&#160;In southern Nigeria this species was widespread in both primary and secondary rainforests, altered forests (bush) and in farmlands (agricultural areas in former lowland rainforests; Angelici <em>et al.</em> 1999).&#160;A study in Lama Forest Reserve in Benin found no significant difference in population densities between plantations and natural forest, and the authors suggested that the distribution of White-bellied Pangolins in the reserve may be more sensitive to forest age than to its composition (Akpona&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).&#160;This suggests that the species can adapt to at least some degree of habitat modification, although it is not known whether it can breed in these altered habitats and whether they thus act as additional habitat or population sinks. Khwaja<em> et al.</em> (in prep) estimated a higher probability of occupancy outside of protected areas, supporting the notion that the species is adaptable to modified and degraded habitats. In northwestern and central Zambia and southern DRC this species occurs in dense Miombo (<em>Brachystegia-Julbernardia</em>) woodland, as well as in forest fragments and riparian forests. White-bellied Pangolins are predominantly nocturnal and equally at home in trees and on the ground (Pagès 1975). The species&#160;feeds exclusively on ants and termites. Breeding is continuous and in Gabon females were rarely found to be not pregnant (Pagès 1975; Kingdon and Hoffmann 2013). The gestation period is approximately 150 days, after which the female gives birth to a single young, which is carried by the female (Kingdon and Hoffmann 2013).<p><br/></p>  <strong></strong><em></em><u></u><sub></sub><sup></sup><strong></strong><em></em><u></u><sub></sub><sup></sup>","<p>  </p><p>The two main threats are overexploitation and habitat loss and degradation. While known to occur in a number of protected areas throughout its range, White-bellied Pangolins are subject to widespread and often intensive exploitation for bushmeat and traditional medicine and are by far the African pangolin species most frequently found in bushmeat markets. &#160;White-bellied Pangolins are increasingly being hunted in protected areas due to the species largely being extirpated outside of protected areas in many regions (Boakye <em>et al</em>. 2016). An estimated 0.4–2.7 million pangolins are hunted each year in Central African forests, and this figure has increased by 150% over the past four decades (Ingram <em>et al.</em> 2018), although the annual harvest rate is likely to be closer to 420,000 individuals per annum as was also estimated by Fa and Peres (2001). Fa <em>et al</em>. (2006) report that during six months of fieldwork in Cameroon in 2002–2003, the White-bellied Pangolin was the fourth most harvested species across 47 sites sampled, after the Brush-tailed Porcupine (<em>Atherurus africanus</em>), Blue Duiker (<em>Philantomba monticola</em>) and Giant Pouched Rat (<em>Cricetomys emini</em>)<em>.</em> Similarly, in a study in Equatorial Guinea around the village of Sendje (including within Monte Alén National Park), it was the fifth most common mammal species in terms of offtake after the Blue Duiker, Brush-tailed Porcupine, Black Colobus (<em>Colobus satanus</em>) and Giant Pouched Rat (Kümpel 2006). Bräutigam <em>et al</em>. (1994) report that despite pangolins being one of the least commonly sold meats (less than 5% of overall sales) consumer demand for pangolins is high in Gabon, with White-bellied Pangolin meat being the third most requested item at bushmeat markets. The price of White-bellied Pangolins across urban markets in Central and West Africa has increased by 2.3 times between 1990 and 2015 (Ingram <em>et al. </em>2018). These trends suggest increased demand for the species and/or indicate that White-bellied Pangolins are harder to obtain, probably as a result of population declines.</p><p>  </p><p>The number of pangolins hunted and sold for traditional medicine and cultural practices is huge and most likely unsustainable considering the reproductive biology of this species (Ingram <em>et al</em>. 2018). For example, Soewu and Ayodele (2009) reported a total of 178 whole White-bellied Pangolins being sold for traditional medicine amongst the Ijebus of Ogun State, southwestern Nigeria between April and July 2007, which averaged 1.06 carcasses per dealer per month. Sodeinde and Adedipe (1994) also noted that pangolins used in traditional medicine in south-western Nigeria are exclusively White-bellied Pangolins, the Black-bellied Pangolin (<em>P. tetradactyla</em>) being much rarer. Pregnant female and juvenile pangolins are preferred for some practices (D. Soewu, unpubl. data).</p><p>  </p><p>White-bellied Pangolins are frequently recorded in international trade (Bräutigam <em>et al</em>. 1994, Challender and Hywood 2012, Challender and Waterman 2017, Heinrich <em>et al</em>. 2017, Krishnasamy and Shepherd 2017, Mwale <em>et al</em>. 2017, Ingram <em>et al</em>. 2018, 2019) and according to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) trade data, in the period 1985–2015. This includes the trade in live animals: in 2016, 46 live White-bellied Pangolins were imported to the USA from Togo for zoological purposes.&#160;Between 2013 and 2015, 2,010 kg of White-bellied Pangolin scales (which equates to approximately 5,576 individuals) were traded. These include 1,950 kg from Congo to China, 950 kg from the Democratic Republic of the Congo to China (2014–2015) and 60 kg from Togo to Hong Kong SAR (though export data shows only 30 kg of scales exported from Togo during this period (Challender and Waterman, 2017).&#160;<br/></p><p>The scale of illegal international trade, in particular to Asian markets, is much greater, and is a major threat to the species. Challender <em>et al.</em> (2019) estimate that between 2015 and 2018 scales from approximately 200,000 African pangolins were seized either in Africa bound for export or en route to Asian markets. There is also evidence that tropical African pangolins including this species are being specifically targeted at the point of harvest for their scales for illicit export, i.e. as opposed to being a by-product of the bushmeat trade (O. Drori, pers. comm.). Heinrich <em>et al.</em> (2017) observed that of all large-quantity pangolin scale shipments (weighing 1,000 kg or more) between 2010–2015, 55% were found to originate in Africa and these large-quantity shipments accounted for 60% of all scales traded. Furthermore, both the frequency and weight of large-quantity scale shipments increased through this period (Heinrich <em>et al.</em> 2017). Documented pangolin seizures undoubtedly account for only a small fraction of actual trafficking levels owing to low detection rates associated with wildlife trade (Challender and Hywood 2012) and thus the actual illegal trade levels are likely to be higher. Challender and Hywood (2012) report that in 2011 one confiscated consignment comprised 100 White-bellied Pangolin skins (with scales attached) that had originated in Guinea and was bound for Thailand.&#160;</p><p>Past and ongoing habitat loss and degradation is the second main threat. In West Africa in particular, there have been severe losses of forest habitat in recent decades: annual losses were 0.9% between 1990 and 2000 0.3% between 2000 and 2010 (Mayaux <em>et al.</em> 2013). <span><span>In 2018, the Democratic Republic of the Congo had the second highest loss of tropical primary forest in the world, and Ghana and Cote d’Ivoire ranked 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> in terms of their percent increase in loss from 2017 at 60% and 26% respectively (of countries with &gt;100,000 ha of primary forest; World Resources Institute 2019). West Africa also presently has higher human population densities (Tatem 2017), and smaller patches of roadless areas (Ibisch et al. 2016). Annual deforestation is higher in areas with higher human population density (Mayaux et al. 2013), however true rates of decline are imperfectly known. Although the White-Bellied Pangolin appears able to adapt to some degree of habitat modification, this is not well understood and comparative ecology research is needed between natural forest and modified landscapes.&#160;<br/></span></p>","<p>This is the most frequently encountered of the African forest pangolins, occurring in moderate densities in suitable habitat (Kingdon and Hoffmann 2013), but apparently uncommon across its range. There are few quantitative data on populations at any level i.e. local, national or global. In 2017 the majority of range states reported that populations of this species are either data deficient or in decline (see Challender and Waterman 2017). The species&#160;is believed to be declining in Ghana, Guinea and Uganda and close to extinction in Rwanda (Bräutigam <em>et al.</em> 1994, Kityo <em>et al</em>. 2016). In Ghana, hunters in villages in the Ashanti region of the Upper Guinea Forest Ecosystem reported in 2011 that White-bellied Pangolins were rare (Alexander <em>et al.</em> 2015), though they were considered common by more than 70% of hunters (n = 35) in the Akposa Traditional Area in the Volta Region (Emieaboe <em>et al.</em> 2014). In southern Benin, hunters considered the species to be rare in 2007–2008 (Djagoun and Gaubert 2009). Akeredolu <em>et al. </em>(2018) report that 70% of local hunters, wildlife vendors and community leaders surveyed in Lagos, Nigeria, believe that wild pangolin populations are in decline while hunters in southeastern Nigeria classified this species as ‘very rare’ (Akani <em>et al</em>. 2015). Soewu and Ayodele (2009) report that&#160;92% of traditional Yorubic-medical practitioners&#160;among the Awori people in&#160;Ogun State, Nigeria,&#160;believe that the abundance of pangolins&#160;is steadily decreasing while more than 97% reported a continuous decline in the size of pangolins caught. Boakye <em>et al. </em>(2016) suggest that previous studies of White-bellied Pangolin occurrence in bushmeat markets in Ghana have underestimated harvest rates from the wild. In south-eastern Cameroon, a density of 0.68 individuals/km² was suggested following a study recording pangolin sightings and evidence of activity (Bobo <em>et al</em>. 2014). In the Lama Forest Reserve, Benin, Akpona <em>et al.</em> (2008) estimated a density of 0.84 individuals/km² during the dry season in natural forest and monoculture plantation. A review of Afrotropical forest mammals suggested a density of 10.9 individuals/km² (Fa and Purvis 1997), but this appears to be an overestimate based on small sample size and poor data. <span>Laurance <em>et al.</em> (2006) found that pangolins increased in abundance outside of protected oil concessions in Gabon, possibly in response to greater forest disturbance within concessions. <span>The species is rarely recorded in the United Republic of Tanzania, where pangolins were encountered on two out of 1,500 camera trap nights in Minziro Forest (see Challender and Waterman 2017).</span></p><p><span><strong></strong><em></em><u></u><sub></sub><sup></sup><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>  <strong></strong><em></em><u></u><sub></sub><sup></sup><br/></p>",Decreasing,"<p>This species ranges from Guinea-Bissau (Cantanhez National Park; Bout and Ghiurghi, 2013) in West Africa through Guinea, Sierra Leone and much of West Africa but there are no confirmed records from Senegal or The Gambia (Grubb <em style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"">et al.</em> 1998). There are fewer records eastward in southern Togo and Benin (Akpona <em>et al.</em> 2008, Amori <em>et al.</em> 2016). There are also unverified reports from northern Benin (H. Akpona, unpubl. data). The species occurs in southern Nigeria (Angelici <em>et al.</em> 1999; Sodeinde and Adedipe 1994), and Cameroon (Jeannin 1936), Equatorial Guinea (Kümpel 2006), including Bioko island (Albrechtsen <em>et al.</em> 2007), Gabon (Pagès, 1965) and Congo, (R. Jansen, unpubl. data), Central African Republic and Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) (e.g., Garamba National Park; Monroe <em>et al.</em> 2015; van Vliet <em>et al.</em> 2015). There are records from Burundi and Rwanda (Verschuren 1987) and Uganda, including in Semuliki National Park (Kityo 2009; Treves <em>et al.</em> 2010; S. Nixon, unpubl. data). The species then ranges as far east as south-western Kenya and north-western Tanzania (west of Lake Tanganyika) and as far south as north-western Zambia and northern Angola (Jansen <em>et al.</em> 2019; Kingdon and Hoffmann 2013). In Tanzania, the species is known from the Minziro Forest Reserve on the northwest border with Uganda, and close to Bukoba (Foley <em>et al.</em> 2014). The extreme eastern distribution is southwest Kenya, including in the Kakamega Forest Reserve (Roth and Cords 2015). To the south, the species occurs in northern Angola, including Cabinda, and there are recent records from Cangandala National Park (Beja <em>et al.</em> 2019; Hill and Carter 1941). There are also confirmed records from northwestern Zambia (near Solwezi) and central Zambia (Serenje) close to the DRC border from 2016–2018 indicating that the species occurs further south than previously recorded (Fig. 9.4; Jansen <em>et al.</em> 2019).&#160;&#160;</p>","<p>  </p><p>White-bellied Pangolins are subject to widespread and often intensive exploitation for bushmeat and traditional medicine on a local and regional scale within Africa (e.g. Anadu <em>et al.</em> 1988, Fa <em>et al.</em> 2006, Boakye <em>et al</em>. 2014, 2015, 2016, Ingram <em style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"">et al</em>. 2018). Bräutigam <em>et al.</em> (1994) reported the species to be by far the most common of the pangolin species found for sale in African bushmeat markets and this appears to still be the case (Boakye <em>et al. </em>2016, Heinrich <em>et al.</em> 2017). Anadu <em>et al.</em> (1988) identified White-bellied and Black-bellied Pangolins (<em>P. tetradactyla</em>) as the second most expensive bushmeat in Nigeria in 1982. In Gabon, 120 White-bellied Pangolins were observed for sale at four bushmeat markets throughout the country during 1993 (Steel 1994). Although pangolins were consistently one of the least commonly sold meats, comprising &lt;5% of the total sales overall, consumer demand was relatively high. According to traders, White-bellied Pangolin meat was the third most requested item and of 206 consumers interviewed 10% regarded pangolins as their preferred type of bushmeat.&#160;</p><p>  </p><p><a name=""_3znysh7""></a>Boakye <em>et al</em>. (2016) physically observed 98 out of 341 pangolins (live and carcasses) reportedly traded by farmer-hunters, chopbar operators and wholesalers in Ghana between September 2013 and November 2014. Of these, 82% were identified as White-bellied Pangolins and 18% as Black-bellied Pangolins. The authors suggested that in focusing upon major bushmeat markets, previous studies have underestimated the extent of pangolin trade. Ingram <em>et al</em>. (2018) noted that estimated increases in the number of pangolins hunted from Central African forests did not correspond with trends observed at markets, implying that there are alternative supply chains. Ingram <em>et al</em>. (2018) further estimated that 0.4–2.7 million pangolins, mainly White-bellied Pangolins, are hunted or poached in Central Africa on an annual basis, with these values inferred using three different calculation methods. Their area-based estimate of 420,000 individuals poached per annum is believed to be the more realistic estimate and closely reflects the value of ~400,000 individuals poached annually estimated by Fa &amp; Peres (2001). In a survey of 200 hunters, wildlife vendors and community leaders in Lagos, Nigeria, the following were perceived as the main reasons for trade in pangolins: a commodity of foreign exchange (31%), local consumption (28%), cultural and ethno-medicinal purposes (20%), use in juju/voodoo (11%) and for decoration (10%; Akeredolu <em>et al. </em>2018). Soewu and Sodeinde (2015) report that White-bellied Pangolin skins are processed into leather for use in footwear and other clothing items. </p><p>  </p><p><a name=""_mh6z5ea731ne""></a>Many of the reported medicinal properties of pangolin parts are based on the use of scales and their derivatives and consequently the value of scales (as opposed to meat) appears to be very high (Bräutigam <em>et al</em>. 1994). Akpona <em>et al.</em> (2008) recorded that some organs, such as the skin, heart, intestines and head, are used for treating asthma and cardiovascular and dermatological issues, whilst Boakye <em>et al.</em> (2014, 2015) identified 13 pangolin body parts that were used medicinally in Ghana and 22 parts that were used to treat 59 different health problems in Sierra Leone. Sodeinde and Adedipe (1994) report that medicinal use (<em>juju</em>) appears to be more important than food in southwestern Nigeria. Following market surveys and interviews with hunters, they recorded that White-bellied Pangolin scales and other parts were worn as charms and ornaments and also processed into medicinal compounds, whilst the flesh is eaten and also used for <em>juju</em>. A study investigating the utilisation of pangolins in traditional Yorubic medicine in southwestern Nigeria recorded that White-bellied Pangolins were used to treat 42 medical conditions including infertility, gastrointestinal disorders, rheumatism, venereal diseases and back pain. They were also believed to confer invisibility and remove bad luck, as well as being used as love potions and for appeasing/warding off witches or evil spirits. Some of these uses specifically required juvenile or pregnant female pangolins (Soewu and Ayodele 2009). Angelici <em>et al</em>. (1999) reported that the dried tail of the White-bellied Pangolin is sometimes used to mark and tattoo human skin during the initiation of young unmarried women in some bush-hamlets in southeastern Nigeria.</p><p>  </p><p>Heinrich <em>et al.</em> (2016, 2017) state that a decline in CITES trade in Asian pangolin species corresponds with an increase in trade in African pangolin species post 2000. White-bellied Pangolins are the most frequently legally live traded African pangolin species (Challender and Waterman 2017). Of all large-quantity pangolin scale shipments (weighing 1,000 kg or more) seized between 2010–2015, 55% originated from Africa. These large-quantity shipments accounted for 60% of all scales traded. Furthermore, both the frequency and weight of large-quantity scale shipments increased through this period (Heinrich <em>et al.</em> 2017). Between 2013 and 2015, 2,010 kg of White-bellied Pangolin scales (which equates to approximately 5,576 individuals) were traded. These include 1,950 kg from Congo to China, 950 kg from the Democratic Republic of the Congo to China (2014–2015) and 60 kg from Togo to Hong Kong SAR (though export data shows only 30 kg of scales exported from Togo during this period). Trade in live White-bellied Pangolins includes a reported 200 animals exported from Nigeria to China in 2015 for captive breeding purposes. In 2012, 250 White-bellied Pangolins were exported from Togo to Lao PDR and 200 from Togo to Viet Nam. In 2016, 46 live White-bellied Pangolins were imported to the USA from Togo for zoological purposes.&#160;</p><p>Evidence from recent customs seizures indicate a burgeoning illicit, intercontinental trade in African pangolins, almost exclusively their scales, to Asian markets, particularly China and Viet Nam, where the scales are used as an in traditional medicine (Challender and Waterman 2017, Heinrich <em style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"">et al</em>. 2017, Krishnasamy and Shepherd 2017, Mwale <em style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"">et al</em>. 2017, Ingram <em style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"">et al</em>. 2018, 2019). Of the African pangolin species, White-bellied Pangolins are the species most frequently found in illegal trade (Challender and Waterman 2017). An increasing number of African countries involved in international pangolin trafficking and several large shipments of pangolin scales originating from Africa further implies a market shift (Heinrich <em style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"">et al</em>. 2017, Krishnasamy and Shepherd 2017, Ingram <em style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"">et al</em>. 2018, 2019). Examples of such seizures include: three shipments totalling 12.3 tonnes in Hong Kong SAR and China from Nigeria (2015–2017); four tonnes in Hong Kong SAR from Cameroon in 2016; three tonnes in Hong Kong SAR from Uganda in 2014; and 712 kg in Malaysia from Ghana and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Gomez <em style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"">et al</em>. 2016, Challender and Waterman 2017).

Challender <em>et al.</em> (2019) estimated that between 2015 and 2018 scales from approximately 200,000 African pangolins were seized either in Africa bound for export or en route to Asia. A seizure of whole, smoked White-bellied Pangolin carcasses together with other bushmeat in Zurich, Switzerland (Kathy Wood, unpubl. data) indicates that this country may be a conduit to the Asian markets, or that bushmeat is also being traded to European countries to supply the expatriate communities here (see also Chaber <em style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"">et al</em>. 2010).<strong></strong><em></em><u></u><sub></sub><sup></sup><br/></p>",Terrestrial,"<p>While the White-bellied Pangolin is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), there is a need to improve legislation in many range states, and critically enforcement thereof. This should extend to effective protection of protected areas, especially considering that most pangolins are believed to be poached from protected areas (Boakye <em>et al</em>. 2016). Vigilance by Customs authorities and efforts in the field to prevent the extraction of White-bellied Pangolins must be increased. At present there is little quantitative information on the status of White-bellied Pangolins at local or national levels, however current extraction rates are seemingly unsustainable and the species is believed to be decreasing in abundance across its range. Research into the population status of this species in different habitats incorporating more comprehensive studies of population parameters and its ability to withstand hunting pressure is required, along with continued monitoring of demand and use.&#160;Similarly, additional monitoring and research needs include understanding the extent of intercontinental trafficking.&#160;In June 2012, the EU SRG banned the importation of White-bellied Pangolins to the EU based on concerns about the sustainability of trade volumes of this species from Guinea.</p><p>  <strong></strong><em></em><u></u><sub></sub><sup></sup><br/></p>",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

Being precautionary, it is inferred that populations will decline by &gt;80% both looking forward three generations (2019-2040) and looking backwards one generations and forwards two generations (2012-2033) based on apparent overexploitation from hunting and poaching, which evidence indicates is increasingly for illicit, international trade, an addition to domestic trade and use. This is compounded by the species limited geographic distribution and development on Palawan decreasing the area of available natural habitat. It is further compounded by the likelihood that law enforcement changes on a level needed to prevent the overexploitation of the species are unlikely to occur within three generations time; there is currently weak evidence that demand reduction efforts in key consumer countries for Asian pangolin products and derivatives,&#160;which theoretically could lead to a reduction in harvest are effective, and incentives for harvesting and illegally trading the species are substantial based on the high financial value of pangolin parts and derivatives locally, nationally and internationally. </p>","<p>The main habitat of the Philippine Pangolin is primary and secondary lowland forest (Schoppe and Cruz 2009, Lagrada 2012), but like other pangolin species it uses a diverse range of habitats, suggesting it may be adaptable to heterogeneous or mosaic habitats (Lagrada 2012, Chong <em>et al.</em> 2019). The species has been recorded in lowland grassland/forest mosaics and logged-over lowland forest (Esselstyn <em>et al.</em> 2004), agricultural ecosystems (Schoppe and Cruz 2009, Lagrada 2012), coastal areas near beach forest and mangroves, and in riverine forest (Marler 2016). According to Indigenous people, in the late 1960s, when the human population density was low within the species' range, it was commonly seen near houses (Acosta and Schoppe 2018). Additionally, in the late 1970s and 1980s it was apparently commonly seen in coastal and lowland areas (J. Fabello in litt. to S. Schoppe, June 2018). Although there have been no studies on habitat preference, limited research suggests that the species may occur at higher densities in primary forests (Lagrada 2012). Habitat preference is assumed to be related to prey abundance, water, and availability of resting places (e.g. burrows; Schoppe <em>et al.</em> in prep. a).</p>  <p>Little is known about the ecology of the Philippine Pangolin. It is primarily nocturnal and has a specialist diet of ants and termites. Its activity pattern may be influenced by the lunar phase, with individuals being active for longer periods during full moon (Schoppe and Alvarado 2015b). The species is semi-arboreal (Lagrada 2012, Schoppe and Alvarado 2015b, 2016), and rests during the day in burrows in the ground, in and amongst large rocks, or in tree hollows (Schoppe <em>et al.</em> in prep b). It forages at night from ant and termite nests both terrestrially and arboreally (Schultze 1914, Lagrada 2012).</p>  <p>Radio-telemetry studies on six wild-caught individuals have provided initial insights into home range size and homing behaviour (Schoppe and Alvarado 2016, Schoppe <em>et al.</em> 2017; in prep. b). Estimates of female home range size for two individuals are 47 and 75 ha, with core areas of 12 and 18 ha, respectively. Male home range sizes for three individuals were estimated at 59, 96, and 120 ha, with core areas of 29, 45, and 68 ha respectively. (Schoppe and Alvarado 2016, Schoppe <em>et al.</em> 2017, in prep. b). Male home ranges did not overlap, suggesting territoriality. Mean distance moved by females and males in 24 hours was 3.1±0.6 km (range 0–4 km) and 4.2±0.6 km (range 3–5.3 km) respectively. </p>  <p>There have been no studies on the reproductive behaviour or maternal care of the Philippine Pangolin; consequently much of the knowledge is derived from anecdotal evidence, or presumed similarities with the Sunda Pangolin (<em>Manis javanica</em>). According to Indigenous people, they typically have just one offspring, although occasionally two foetuses have been encountered upon slaughtering of the animals (Acosta and Schoppe 2018). Breeding is assumed to be aseasonal, like the Sunda Pangolin (Schoppe <em>et al.</em> in prep. a). However, farmers have reported that mothers with young are typically seen in August (Schoppe and Cruz 2009), with one observation in November (Schoppe and Alvarado 2016).</p>","<p>The principle threat to the Philippine Pangolin is overexploitation from hunting and poaching, while habitat loss also poses a threat (Schoppe and Cruz 2009, Lagrada 2012). These threats are compounded by the species' restricted range (Schoppe <em>et al.</em> in prep a).</p>  <p>The Philippine Pangolin was historically hunted at a local level for meat and traditional uses, and for trade at a domestic level (i.e. within the Philippines) which included its blood, meat, skins, and scales (Esselstyn <em>et al.</em> 2004, Cruz <em>et al.</em> 2007, Schoppe and Cruz 2009). International trade (whole animal, meat, scales and skin) was rare in 2008 (Schoppe and Cruz 2009) and appeared to have declined following heavy exploitation of the species during the 1970s-1990s for international trade in skins. During the 1970s-1990s, the species had not been recognised as distinct from the Sunda Pangolin, and was traded under CITES as the Sunda Pangolin (see Challender <em>et al.</em> 2015). Heaney <em>et al.</em> (1998) stated that the species was heavily hunted, and probably threatened, whilst Esselstyn <em>et al.</em> (2004) reported that hunting pressure was moderate. Hunters stated that pangolins used to be very common in Palawan; and they reported catching greater numbers in the past, and that hunting for trade and subsistence seem to be the main reasons for its decline (Schoppe and Cruz 2009). Poaching is reported to be particularly high in northern Palawan, where it is suspected there is a higher density of the species (Bayron 2014).</p>  <p>At the local level, hunting has been reported to be common in southern Palawan (van den Beukel <em>et al.</em> 2008, KFI 2008). A 2009 study indicated that the majority of pangolin hunting was for subsistence purposes (Schoppe and Cruz 2009). However, a later study indicated that the majority of pangolin hunting was for trade, i.e. no longer for local use (Bayron, 2014). This shift from subsistence to market economies has been noted among members of the Tagbanua and other ethnic groups, and is a significant threat to the species (Esselstyn<em> et al.</em> 2004, Lacerna and Widmann 2008).</p>  <p>Hunting for national trade (i.e. with the Philippines) has been known to occur since the 1980s (Schoppe and Cruz 2009). The Philippine Pangolin is poached for the food and traditional medicine markets within Palawan and in major cities in the Philippines including Manila (Schoppe and Alvarado 2015, TRAFFIC 2018). Recent evidence also demonstrates there is an increasing illicit international trade involving the species, the full extent of which is unknown (Cruz <em>et al.</em> 2007, Schoppe and Cruz 2009, Pantel and Anak 2010, Challender <em>et al.</em> 2015, Challender and Waterman 2017). Despite national legislation, Asian pangolins are persistently hunted for the illegal international trade, largely to supply demand in China and Vietnam for meat and scales used in traditional medicines (Challender and Waterman 2017, Heinrich <em>et al</em>. 2017). As pangolin populations have been severely depleted in China (Zhang 2009), the bulk of demand for pangolin products is now met with pangolins from elsewhere in Asia, placing a more intensive hunting pressure on all Asian pangolin species, as well as the African species (Challender and Waterman 2017, Heinrich <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p>  <p>The numbers of pangolins involved in national and international trafficking are unknown (Schoppe and Cruz 2009). A study analysing seizure data between 2001-2017 found a total of 39 seizure incidents within this period, involving an estimate 667 individuals, and implicating the Philippines as either a source country or place of seizure (Gomez and Sy 2018). This study found that seizures in the Philippines increased after 2010, peaking in 2012 and 2014, whilst the volume of pangolins seized increased from 2010 onwards (Gomez and Sy 2018); 52% of these seizures consisted of meat and scales, 27% dead whole individuals, 16% individuals (dead or alive), and 5% live animals (Gomez and Sy 2018). Actual volume of trade are likely higher; Challender et al. (2019) reported that trade in Asian pangolins involved more than an estimated 300,000 Asian pangolins between 2001 and 2018. According to poachers in the south of Palawan, the demand for pangolins has increased, presumably due to increasing demand from China (KFI 2008). Between 2006-2013 an increase in price and a shift from meat/live animals to scales was noticeable from 2006-2013 (S. Schoppe, unpubl. data). The observed increase in the number of confiscations and number of confiscated animals indicates either an increase in demand and/or trade or improved law enforcement (KFI 2013).&#160; </p>","<p>  </p><p>There is limited knowledge of Philippine Pangolin populations. This species is infrequently observed, partly due to its increasing rarity, but also because of its elusive, solitary, and nocturnal habits, and there is a lack of research on population densities or abundance.</p><p>  </p><p>The species is heavily hunted, and it is suspected that populations are declining (Esselstyn <em>et al.</em> 2004, Schoppe and Cruz 2009; Bayron 2014, Schoppe <em>et al.</em> 2017; in prep. a). Interview-based research with various respondent groups supports suspected population reduction. On Palawan Island and the Calamian Islands, interviews with local community members suggest that the species was formerly relatively common, but since the turn of the century (i.e. from 2000) it has become very rare (Rico and Oliver 2006, Schoppe and Cruz 2009, Lagrada 2012). Interviews with Indigenous peoples groups from Tagbanua, Batak, and Palaw’an Tribes, and Cuyunon communities from the Calamian Islands and Palawan Island revealed similar results. Despite some difficulties in quantifying remaining wild populations, these groups estimated population declines between 1980 and 2018 to be around 85% in the south and 95% in the north of Palawan (Acosta and Schoppe 2018). Local hunters also reported lower catch per unit effort compared to the past, for example one hunter in southern Palawan reported catching 3-4 pangolins a week in 1992, compared to just one per month in 2012 (Lagrada 2012,&#160;Bayron 2014).</p><p>Early literature suggests that the Philippine pangolin is naturally rare (Rabor 1965, Heaney <em>et al.</em> 1998). In 1965 the species was described as uncommon, and population reduction was attributed to the clearing of forests, although hunting was also acknowledged (Rabor 1965). In 1998, Heaney et al. (1998) noted that the species was uncommon and heavily hunted.</p><p>  </p><p>It has been noted that the species is not distributed evenly across its range (Heaney <em>et al.</em> 1998). Interview-based research and density estimations have demonstrated that the species is found in higher densities in northern compared to southern Palawan (Schoppe and Cruz 2009, Lagrada 2012, Schoppe and Alvarado 2015a, b, Schoppe <em>et al.</em> 2017; in prep. a). Additionally, surveys have indicated that the Philippine Pangolin is found in higher densities on islands compared to mainland Palawan (Schoppe <em>et al.</em> 2017; in prep. a).&#160;</p><p>Population density estimates are available from a survey of six sites representing northeastern islands, Central Palawan, and Southern Palawan (Schoppe <em>et al.</em> 2017; in prep. a). This study estimated a mean density of adults of 2.5±1.4 adults/km² across all the sites. Population density on the islands in northeastern Palawan was estimated at 3.8±0.35 adults/km² with lower estimates in central and southern sites (1.8±1.61 adult/km² and two adult/km²) respectively. A survey on Brookes Point in southern Palawan estimated a much lower density of 0.05 pangolins/km², but this discrepancy is likely due to the different survey method used (Lagrada 2012). There are currently no other comparable densities available for this species.<strong></strong><em></em><br/></p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Philippine Pangolin (<em>Manis culionensis</em>) is endemic to the Philippines, where it is restricted to the Province of Palawan, also known as the Palawan faunal region (Everett 1889, Bourns and Worcester 1894, Lawrence 1939, Heaney <em style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"">et al</em>. 1998). It has historically been recorded in this region only, with occurrence records on mainland Palawan, the Calamian Islands, and several smaller surrounding islands (Everett 1889, Bourns and Worcester 1894, de Elera 1915, Lawrence, 1939) and Batas Island in Taytay (Schoppe <em>et al.</em> 2017, in prep. a, Acosta and Schoppe 2018). There are indications from Indigenous people and local communities that it may also occur on islands off of El Nido, including Lagen Island, Tagnipa, and Nagbilisong Islands in San Vincente (Acosta and Schoppe 2018). Additionally the species occurs on Apulit Island, which is apparently the result of an introduction, which may also explain its presence on Lagen Island (S. Schoppe, unpubl. data).&#160; &#160;</p><p>  </p><p>North of mainland Palawan the species is found on the Calamian Islands, including Culion Island (Hollister 1913, de Elera 1915, Corbet and Hill 1992, Heaney <em style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"">et al</em>. 1998), Calauit Island (Alviolla III 1998), and Busuanga Island (Hoogstraal 1951). Interview surveys conducted in 2006 with local people indicate that the species occurs in 25 localities on 12 islands dispersed across the islands of Calauit, Busuanga, and Culion, and at least nine smaller islands from the Calamian group of islands (Rico and Oliver 2006). Interviewees (Rico and Oliver 2006, Paguntalan <em>et al</em>.<em> </em>2010, 2012, 2015) and also Indigenous peoples from Coron Island (Acosta and Schoppe 2018) suggest that the Philippine Pangolin is absent from Coron Island, but did confirm its presence in the Municipality of Coron on the Island of Busuanga. &#160;</p><p>  </p><p>It is uncertain whether the species occurs on Balabac Island, south of mainland Palawan. Steere (1888) reported the absence of pangolins on the island and the remaining literature provides no evidence of its presence there. Indigenous peoples from southern Palawan have also refuted its presence on Balabac in 2018 (Acosta and Schoppe 2018). In contrast, interviews on illegal trade in pangolins conducted in 2008 with a hunter from the Palaw´an tribe and local people, both from Balabac Island suggested that the species may occur in very low numbers on Balabac Island (Schoppe and Cruz 2008).</p><p>  </p><p><strong></strong><em></em><u></u><sub></sub><sup></sup><br/></p>","<p>This species is hunted at a local, subsistence level for meat consumption and traditional use, and also for trade nationally (blood, meat, skins and scales) and internationally (whole animal, meat, scales and skin) (Esselstyn <em>et al.</em> 2004, Cruz <em>et al.</em> 2007, Schoppe and Cruz 2009, Schoppe and Acosta 2018). </p>  <p>At the local level, Philippine Pangolins have traditionally been hunted for their meat as a food source (Eder 1987, Esselstyn <em>et al.</em> 2004). Archaeological evidence suggests that pangolins have been hunted on Palawan for at least 6000 years (Lewis <em>et al.</em> 2008). The species is reportedly commonly hunted for meat in southern Palawan (van den Beukel <em>et al.</em> 2006, KFI 2008), and this practice was recorded on Dumaran Island until a few years ago (Schoppe and Cruz 2009). </p>  <p>Although hunting at the local level is mostly for meat (Schoppe and Cruz 2009, Lagrada 2012), pangolins are also hunted for medicinal use and rituals (Esselstyn <em>et al.</em> 2004), although this traditional use has been infrequently documented. Pangolin derivatives are often used to treat asthma (Esselstyn <em>et al.</em> 2004). The Tagbanua tribe in Taytay use pangolin meat (raw, boiled, or cooked) to treat gastrointestinal diseases, inflammation, flatulence, asthma, and ulcers (Estrada <em>et al.</em> 2015). Communities in Brooke’s Point reported that scales are worn as a belt by older men to prevent the occurrence of prostrate-related illnesses, while drinking the blood is reportedly rejuvenating, and boiled, powdered scales are used to treat asthma (Lagrada 2012). Scales are burned to stop thunder and the diseases that it is reportedly associated with (Lagrada 2012). Additionally the Tagbanua tribe in Taytay use pangolin scales to deter Aswang (a shapeshifting monster in Filipino folklore; Estrada <em>et al.</em> 2015). Bayron (2014) reports the burning of pangolin skin to remove bad spirits. The Visayan community in central Palawan have been known to keep pangolins as pets, although they are typically willing to sell them for a reasonable price if an opportunity arises (Lacuna-Richman 2006).</p>  <p>A shift from pangolin hunting for subsistence towards hunting for trade has been noted by members of various ethnic groups including the Tagbanua (Esselstyn <em>et al.</em> 2004, Lacerna and Widmann 2008), and has been supported by studies on past and present hunting patterns (Schoppe and Cruz 2009, Bayron 2014). </p>  <p>The Philippine Pangolin is hunted for the food and traditional medicine markets of major cities in the Philippines (Schoppe and Alvarado 2015, Gomez and Sy 2018). There is a high demand for scales and meat in the Philippines from foreign nationals, and the meat is commonly eaten to reinforce social status. For example, ethnic Taiwanese people drink its blood in wine and believe the meat has medicinal values (Schoppe and Cruz 2009). It is traded for these uses within Palawan and from Palawan to Manila (Schoppe and Cruz 2009, TRAFFIC, 2018). Analysis of seizure data suggests that there is a particularly high local demand for pangolin meat and scales in Metro Manila compared to other large cities in the country (Gomez and Sy 2018). Between 2001 and 2017 Manila was implicated in at least ten seizures, including live and frozen animals, which were assumed to be for the exotic food market (Gomez and Sy 2018). Hunters reported renowned buying stations in Roxas and Taytay (Schoppe and Cruz 2009). Hunters also reported that the villages of Dumarao, Sandoval, Mendoza and Magara in Roxas and Capayaz in Dumaran were involved in pangolin trade in the 1980s, and used to supply Puerto Princesa City with pangolin meat and scales (Schoppe and Cruz 2009).&#160; </p>  <p>The Philippine Pangolin, along with all pangolin species, is in high demand for international trade of skin, scales and meat (Wu <em>et al.</em> 2007, Challender <em>et al.</em> 2015). This is largely to supply China with meat and scales, the latter used in traditional medicines (Challender and Waterman 2017). While the Philippine Pangolin has been reported in international trade historically, since 2008 there is evidence of a tangible illicit international trade involving this species, directly to China, and to Sabah (Kudat, Sandakan) in East Malaysia, and Peninsular Malaysia (Schoppe and Cruz 2009, Pantel and Anak 2010). Earlier studies suggested that few hunters (13%) in Palawan were involved in international trade, and it was thought that the species was only exported in small volumes from southern Palawan to Malaysia (Schoppe and Cruz 2009). However according to poachers in southern Palawan, the demand for pangolins has increased, presumably due to higher demand from China (KFI 2008). An increase in price and a shift from meat/live pangolins to scales was noticeable in the period 2006-2013 (S. Schoppe, unpubl. data).</p>",Terrestrial,"<p>The species is present in a number of protected areas, though it should be noted that the entirety of the Province of Palawan was declared a game refuge and bird sanctuary in 1969 (Proclamations 219 and 530-B). The species occurs in Mount Mantalingahan Protected Landscape, Omoi Cockatoo Reserve and Manambaling Cockatoo Reserve in Dumaran Island as well as in Calauit Safari Park, Malampaya Sound, and Puerto Princesa Underground River National Park. Similarly it occurs in Lower Ilian Ilian – Masaya 1 – Maharlika Protected Watershed, Dumarao in Roxas, and Little Baguio - Taliwara – Durian protected watershed, and Mendoza in Roxas.</p><p>The Philippine Pangolin is protected by the Philippine Republic Act 9147 known as the Wildlife Resources Conservation and Protection Act, which prohibits the collection of any form of wildlife without a permit.

Key patches for sustainable populations of Andean Bears were defined as areas larger than 400 km² and within 15 km of the nearest patch (Verboom <span lang=""EN-US""><em>et al</em>.<span lang=""EN-US""> 2001, Velez-Liendo 2014). At the national level, Venezuela showed the greatest projected loss of key patches (70%), with only two of these key patches available to sustain its bear population. Peru, Colombia and Ecuador are projected to lose 31%, 29% and 27% respectively, and Bolivia 19%. Causes of this loss of key patch habitat is associated with human development activities that have not ceased, and in some areas may increase by allowing oil exploration and exploitation within some protected areas. Expansion of the agricultural frontier, inadequate agricultural practices and land/agrarian reforms; mining and oil exploitation, conversion of land to coca crops and the drug trade, have been the main drivers of the loss and degradation of Andean bear habitat (Ataroff and Rada 2000, Palminteri <span lang=""EN-US""><em>et al</em>.<span lang=""EN-US""> 2001, Armenteras <span lang=""EN-US""><em>et al</em>.<span lang=""EN-US""> 2003, 2011; Rodríguez <span lang=""EN-US""><em>et al</em>.<span lang=""EN-US""> 2003, Kattan <em>et al</em>. 2004, Yerena <span lang=""EN-US""><em>et al</em><span lang=""EN-US"">. 2007, Velez-Liendo 2010, Dávalos <span lang=""EN-US""><em>et al</em>.<span lang=""EN-US""> 2011, García-Rangel 2012, Portillo-Quintero <em>et al</em>. 2012, Sánchez-Mercado <span lang=""EN-US""><em>et al</em>.<span lang=""EN-US""> 2014). Three main data sources were used to map these human intrusions on Andean Bear habitat: disturbed areas (roads, settlements, agriculture fields, etc.) from Josse <span lang=""EN-US""><em>et al</em>.<span lang=""EN-US""> (2009), forest cover loss derived from satellite imagery for the period 2000-2013 (Hansen <span lang=""EN-US""><em>et al</em>.<span lang=""EN-US""> 2013) and 8 years (2000-2008) of fire activities from MODIS Rapid Response System data sets (<a href=""http://modis-fire.umd.edu/index.php"">http://modis-fire.umd.edu/index.php</a>) (Velez-Liendo 2010;<span lang=""EN-US""> <span lang=""EN-US"">note: data and imagery were from LANCE FIRMS operated by the NASA/GSFC/Earth Science Data and Information System (ESDIS) with funding provided by NASA/HQ<span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US"">).<br/> <br/> Furthermore, as a consequence of habitat loss, human-bear conflicts are likely to increase resulting in reduced tolerance and escalating bear kills (Goldstein <span lang=""EN-US""><em>et al</em>.<span lang=""EN-US""> 2006; Sánchez-Mercado <span lang=""EN-US""><em>et al</em>.<span lang=""EN-US""> 2008, 2014; García-Rangel 2012; Zukowsky and Ormsby 2016). Thus, even where a habitat patch is of sufficient size to maintain a bear population, human-caused mortality is likely to reduce bear density.<br/> <br/> Climate change projections for 2010-2039 by Tovar <em>et al</em>. (2013) indicate that all ecosystems inhabited by Andean Bears will exhibit a degree of loss: 30% loss for Tropical high altitude grasslands, 24% for Tropical dry and moist shrublands, and 18% for Tropical moist lowland and montane forests. Based on the current state of the Andean Bear’s habitat, the fact that many threats causing reduction and degradation of Andean Bear ecosystems have not ceased, and projected patterns of biodiversity shift caused by climate change, the species is vulnerable to widespread future decline.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p>Andean Bear species’ experts in the Bear Specialist Group considered all of these threats and provided estimates of rates of decline.&#160; Experts estimated rates of decline of &gt;30% for each of the five range countries in the next 30 years and also in a 30-year time window overlapping the present (2000–2030). This qualifies the species for Vulnerable, under criteria A3 and A4. There is also a reasonable likelihood that the global population consists of &lt;10,000 mature adults (given a total population of &lt;20,000 bears), a condition under criteria C1, but since the rate of future population decline is only suspected based on rates of habitat loss or alteration, the nature of the evidence is insufficient (i.e., not directly estimated) to categorize the species under C1.<br/></p><p><span lang=""EN-US""></span></p>","<p>Andean Bear altitudinal range extends from 200 to 4,750 m above sea level, with an area of occupancy covering approximately 260,000 km²<sup> </sup>along the Tropical Andes. The lower limit is on the Western Peruvian range; the upper limit is within Carrasco National Park in Bolivia (Peyton 1980, 1984, 1999; Goldstein 1990, Rodríguez-Rodríguez and Cadena 1991, Rodríguez <em>et al</em>. 2003, Sánchez-Mercado 2008, Figueroa and Stucchi 2009, Velez-Liendo 2010, García-Rangel 2012, Appleton <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/> <br/> The species inhabits a great variety of ecosystems along the Tropical Andes including Tropical dry forests, Tropical moist lowland and montane forests; Tropical dry and moist shrublands, and Tropical high altitude shrubland and grasslands (García-Rangel 2012). Seasonal shifts in habitat use due to changes in food availability have been reported (Peyton 1980, Rodríguez-Rodríguez and Cadena 1991, Velez-Liendo 1999, Paisley 2001, Cuesta <em>et al.</em> 2003, Troya <em>et al</em>. 2004, Ríos-Uzeda <em>et al</em>. 2006, Figueroa and Stucchi 2009). Andean bears are mostly found in Tropical moist forests and Tropical high-altitude grasslands (Peyton 1980, 1987a, 1987b, 1999; Velez-Liendo 1999, Cuesta <em>et al</em>. 2003, Ríos-Uzeda <em>et al</em>. 2006, Sánchez-Mercado 2008), but it remains unclear whether bears can live entirely in high-altitude grasslands and paramo without access to forested areas (Paisley and Garshelis 2006). In the north coast of Peru, Andean bears inhabit a Tropical dry shrubland (Peyton 1999, Figueroa and Stucchi 2009, García-Rangel 2012, Appleton <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/> <br/> Andean bears are omnivorous and have a suite of physical adaptations for this life style (McLellan and Reiner 1994, Sacco and Van Valkenburgh 2004, Christiansen and Wroe 2007, Christiansen 2008). Anatomical skull and dentition adaptations to grind (Christiansen 2008) and a pseudo-thumb (Salesa <em>et al</em>. 2006) to aid in consuming a diet of fibrous, hard vegetative matter. Andean bears also opportunistically prey on mammals, including rabbits and mountain tapirs (Castellanos 2011a), but most notably free-ranging domestic cattle (Goldstein 1990, 2002; Rodríguez-Rodríguez and Cadena 1991; Peyton 1999; Cuesta and Suárez 2001; Sacco and Van Valkenburgh 2004; Goldstein <em>et al.</em> 2006; Christiansen and Wroe 2007; Christiansen 2008; Torres 2008; Figueroa and Stucchi 2009; García-Rangel 2012). Bromeliads and palm trees constitute the most common food items in the diet of Andean Bears across the majority of their range (Peyton 1980, Goldstein 1990, Rodríguez-Rodríguez and Cadena 1991, Goldstein and Salas 1993, Troya <em>et al</em>. 2004, Rivadeneria-Canedo 2008, Figueroa and Stucchi 2009, Ríos-Uzeda <em>et al</em>. 2009, García-Rangel 2012). On a seasonal basis, fruits are key food sources for the species as they provide carbohydrates, protein and fat necessary to balance their diet (Peyton 1980, 1984, Goldstein 1990, Rodríguez-Rodríguez and Cadena 1991, Rivadeneira-Canedo 2001, Troya <em>et al</em>. 2004, Kattan <em>et al</em>. 2004, Figueroa and Stucchi 2009, Ríos-Uzeda <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/> <br/> Andean Bears are excellent climbers and commonly build tree platforms where they rest, feed on fruits and carcasses, as well as guard feeding areas (Peyton 1980, 1984; Goldstein 1990, 1991, 2002; Torres 2008, García-Rangel 2012). Activity patterns are mainly diurnal, but they vary seasonally and between geographic areas (Paisley 2001, Paisley and Garshelis 2006, Castellanos 2011b). As food is available all year-round in most parts of their range, Andean bears do not hibernate (Peyton 1999, Garshelis 2009). Information on reproduction is limited for Andean Bears and has mainly come from captive individuals (Bloxam 1977, Rosenthal 1988, Claro-Hergueta <em>et al</em>. 2007, Spady <em>et al</em>. 2007, García-Rangel 2012, Enciso and Guimarães 2013).<br/> <br/> The species is polyestrous, a facultative seasonal breeder and experiences delayed implantation (Claro-Hergueta <em>et al</em>. 2007, Spady <em>et al</em>. 2007). In captivity, females show three to four oestrous cycles during a single breeding season with no seasonal ovarian activity (Enciso and Guimarães 2013). Mating has been recorded in the wild at various times of year but peaking between March and October (Peyton 1980, Peyton <em>et al</em>. 1998). Litter size varies from one to four, with twins being most common, and may be related to female weight and hence food abundance (Saporiti 1949, Bloxam 1977, Peyton 1980, Claro-Hergueta <em>et al</em>. 2007, García-Rangel 2012). Field observations in Bolivia (Velez-Liendo 1999) suggested that births occur two to three months before the peak of the fruit season, perhaps to allow mothers to leave the den with their cubs when fruits are abundant (Peyton 1980, Peyton <em>et al</em>. 1998, Velez-Liendo 1999, Velez-Liendo and Paisley 2010). In captivity, time of birth varies with latitude but births usually occur from February to September (Garshelis 2004, Claro-Hergueta <em>et al</em>. 2007).</p>","<p>                   </p><p><strong>Habitat Loss</strong><br/> The Tropical Andes has been home to human communities, including the great Inca Empire, for thousands of years and, as a consequence, 90% of Andean ecosystems have been transformed in some way (Young 1998, 2009; Vina and Cavelier 1999; Ataroff and Rada 2000; Myers <em>et al</em>. 2000; Kattan <em>et al</em>. 2004; Armenteras <em>et al</em>. 2011). The expansion of the agricultural frontier, together with inadequate agricultural practices and land/agrarian reforms, have been the main drivers of the loss of natural ecosystems (Peyton <em>et al</em>. 1998, Yerena 1998, Young 1998, Vina and Cavelier 1999, Ataroff and Rada 2000, Armenteras <em>et al</em>. 2011, Portillo-Quintero <em>et al</em>. 2012). Mining and oil exploitation are becoming an increasing menace not only to bears, but to local communities due to land expropriation, loss of habitat connectivity, and contamination of water and soil (Young and León 1999, Bury 2002, Bebbington <em>et al</em>. 2008, Bebbington 2009). Conversion of land to coca crops and the drug trade, together with guerrilla groups in some parts of the Andes, favours a lawless land-use system that also impacts the quality of Andean Bear habitats and the bear's probability of long-term survival (Rodríguez <em>et al</em>. 2003, Yerena <em>et al</em>. 2007, Dávalos <em>et al.</em> 2011, García-Rangel 2012).<br/> <br/> <strong>Illegal Killing</strong><br/> Illegal killing is an important, but underestimated threat for Andean Bears. Based on a review of the literature, an average of about 180 bears are known to be killed per year across its range—it is suspected that the real number is much higher, and is likely increasing. For example, recent assessments in northern Ecuador showed unprecedented numbers of cattle killed by bears (at least 320 during the period 2009-2014; Zukowski and Ormsby 2016), as more people are turning to dairy cow farming as a livelihood (Jampel 2016). Bears are killed for retaliation against crop or livestock depredations (or protection against future depredations), for cultural or medical beliefs, and for commercial trade (Orejuela and Jorgenson 1999, Peyton 1999, Rumiz and Salazar 1999, Rodríguez <em>et al</em>. 2003, Yerena <em>et al</em>. 2007, Figueroa 2008, Figueroa and Stucchi 2009, Lameda 2011, E.D. Rodríguez pers. comm. 2014, M.P. Viteri pers. comm. 2014). Since the number of bears killed is likely underestimated by a wide margin, the effects of such killing on bear populations is hard to assess, but rates of killing are high in some areas. Sanchez-Mercado <em>et al.</em> (2008, 2014) estimated that up to 36% of the bear’s distribution in the Cordillera de Merida in Venezuela was within an “ecological trap”, due to human threats. These authors estimated that the effects of this threat combined with habitat fragmentation could be fostering an extinction probability higher than 50% over the next 50 years across this mountain range. Bears are killed during opportunistic encounters, while sport hunting, or as retaliation after damaging crops, particularly maize, or killing livestock (Goldstein 1991, 2002; Peyton 1999, Poveda 1999, Morales Vargas 2003, Goldstein <em>et al</em>. 2006, Sánchez-Mercado <em>et al</em>. 2008, Torres 2008).<br/> <br/> <strong>Climate Change</strong><br/> Global projections of effects of climate change show a general tendency towards upslope displacement of the mountain biome, suggesting that the Tropical Andes is among the most vulnerable region to climate change (Malcom <em>et al</em>. 2006, Urrutia and Vuille 2009, Beaumont <em>et al</em>. 2011). However, the heterogeneity of this hotspot shows a more complex response (Tovar <em>et al</em>. 2013) affecting phenological patterns and increasing species vulnerability with predictions of species loss ranging from 20-50% due to range contractions for many taxa (Cuesta-Camacho <em>et al</em>. 2008, Lawler <em>et al</em>. 2009, Aguirre <em>et al</em>. 2011, Graham <em>et al.</em> 2011, Hoffmann and Sgrò 2011, Chen <em>et al.</em> 2011, Velásquez-Tibatá <em>et al.</em> 2013, Richardson <em>et al.</em> 2013, Pacifici <em>et al.</em> 2015).</p><p> It is likely that all ecosystems associated with Andean Bears will exhibit reductions in their extension. With an increment of +0.74 C in the last century, and a projected increase of 4.3 +/- 0.7 C by 2100 (IPCC 2013), extensive changes in habitat are expected: the Tropical high altitude grasslands is the most fragile ecosystem, with an estimated loss of 30% (Tovar <em>et al.</em> 2013) due to the lack of upslope area for migration. Projected reduction in annual rainfall (IPCC 2013) is likely to affect species highly dependent on humidity such as epiphytic bromeliads (Colwell <em>et al</em>. 2008, Svenning and Condit, 2008, Tewsksbury <em>et al.</em> 2008). Tropical dry and moist shrublands are likely to lose 24% of their area (Tovar <em>et al</em>. 2013), mainly due to a significant variation in the number of dry months (IPCC 2013), while a loss of 18% in area was estimated for Tropical moist lowland and montane forests and Tropical dry forests due to upslope displacements. Furthermore, the extensive (and intensive) land use by human activities in Paramo grasslands, are likely to encroach even further, affecting not only the biodiversity associated to this ecosystem, but also the ecosystem services this biome provides to the region.<br/> <br/> Changes in climate regimes must therefore be considered as a growing threat for Andean Bears, as they are likely to alter habitat quality as well as land-use patterns, and increase the probability of human–bear encounters and conflict (Karanth and Chellam 2009, Aguirre <em>et al.</em> 2011, Hoffmann and Sgrò 2011, Chen <em>et al</em>. 2011, Sheridan and Bickford 2011, Mysterud 2013, Ripple <em>et al.</em> 2014). Even more, the areas considered to be most vulnerable to climate change across the Andes are those considered important for Andean bears including: Yanachaga Chemillen National Park (NP) (Peru), Manu NP (Peru), Madidi NP (Bolivia), Apolobamba ANMI (Bolivia), Carrasco NP (Bolivia) and Amboro NP (Bolivia) (Hoffman <em>et al.</em> 2011).</p>","<p>Expert knowledge, data extrapolations, genetic analysis, mark-recapture, radio tracking and sign surveys, as well as ecological modelling have been used to estimate population sizes and densities of Andean Bears (Peyton 1984, 1999; Yerena 1994; Peyton <em>et al</em>. 1998; Cuesta and Suárez 2001; Ruiz-García 2003; Kattan <em>et al</em>. 2004; Viteri 2007; Ríos-Uzeda <em>et al</em>. 2007; Velez-Liendo 2010; Garshelis 2011; García-Rangel 2012). Wild populations are believed to be on decline due to habitat loss and fragmentation, and illegal killing (Rodríguez <em>et al</em>. 2003, Kattan <em>et al</em>. 2004, Yerena <em>et al</em>. 2007, Sánchez-Mercado <em>et al</em>. 2008, Velez-Liendo <em>et al</em>. 2009, Velez-Liendo and Paisley 2010, García-Rangel 2012). National assessments applying different approaches estimated 1,100-1,600 bears in Venezuela (Ruiz-García 2003), 3,000-6,000 in Colombia (Ruiz-García 2003), 1,200-2,000 in Ecuador (Cuesta and Suárez 2001, Viteri 2007), ~5,000 bears in Peru (Peyton 1999), and ~3,000 bears in Bolivia (Velez-Liendo 2010). These rather crude countrywide estimates, yielding a range-wide estimate of 13,000-18,000 bears (5-7 bears/100 km² over its 260,000 km² range), are reasonably consistent with three empirically-derived mark-recapture (re-sight) density estimates of 3-8 bears/100 km² (Viteri 2007, Ríos-Uzeda <em>et al</em>. 2007, S. Molina, pers. comm). It should be cautioned, however, that all abundance and density estimates for this species have known biases, so consistency among the estimates is not verification of their accuracy (Garshelis 2011).</p><p><span lang=""EN-US""></p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Andean Bear is the only extant bear species in South America and is endemic to the Tropical Andes (Kattan <em>et al</em>. 2004; Ríos-Uzeda <em>et al</em>. 2006, 2007; Viteri 2007; Viteri and Waits 2009; García-Rangel 2012). The distribution of this species is long (<em>ca</em> 4,600 km) and narrow (<em>ca</em> 200-650 km) in the mountains from Venezuela to Bolivia (Peyton <em>et al.</em> 1998, Yerena 1998, Peyton 1999, Rodríguez <em>et al</em>. 2003, Kattan <em>et al</em>. 2004). From North to South, Andean bears are found in Sierra de Perijá and Cordillera de Mérida in Venezuela; the Occidental, Central, and Oriental Andean mountain ranges of Colombia; both Eastern and Western slopes of the Ecuadorian Andes; across the three Peruvian Andean mountain ranges, including a portion of the North Pacific coastal desert; and in the Eastern slope of the Tropical Andes in Bolivia (García-Rangel 2012). The possible presence of the bear in Panama was reported by Hershkovitz (1957), but recent surveys in the area did not find evidence to support this claim (Goldstein <em>et al.</em> 2008). Recently, presence of Andean bears in Northern Argentina has been confirmed by Cosse <em>et al</em>. (2014) through genetics. However, given that these presence points are up to 300 km south (straight line) of the known most-southerly population in Bolivia, they may represent vagrant individuals rather than resident populations.</p>",<p>Some bears are killed for cultural and medical purposes. The extent of commercial trade is unknown but likely limited.</p>,Terrestrial,"<p>                   </p><p>The Andean Bear has been listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN since 1982 and has been included in CITES Appendix I since 1975. A total of 58 protected areas have been established across the Andean Bear distribution, but threats remain within their boundaries with most of these areas being no more than “Paper Parks” lacking adequate budget and staff (Hardner 2008; Sánchez-Mercado <em>et al</em>. 2008; Monsalve Dam <em>et al</em>. 2010; García-Rangel 2011, 2012). Although efforts to establish, maintain and connect old and new protected areas along the bear’s range have been carried out (e.g., Vilcabamba-Amboro corridor between Peru and Bolivia and the interconnected system of protected areas in the Venezuela Andes), large portions of the bear’s habitat are still unprotected and poaching has not been controlled (Yerena 1994, 1998;Yerena <em>et al</em>. 2003, Kattan <em>et al</em>. 2004, Surkin <em>et al</em>. 2010, Yerena and García-Rangel 2010, Hoffman <em>et al</em>. 2011, Sánchez-Mercado <em>et al</em>. 2014). Recently (2007-2014), a number of important steps towards Andean Bear conservation have been undertaken across its distribution including: (1) promotion of Andean Bear conservation by local education programmes and research projects carried out by conservation groups, NGOs, zoological parks, universities, research institutes and government agencies in Bolivia, Peru and Venezuela (Figueroa and Stucchi 2009, Albarracín 2010, García-Rangel 2012). (2) The publication of national action plans for Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador (Sánchez-Mercado 2008, Castellanos <em>et al</em>. 2010, Monsalve Dam <em>et al</em>. 2010), and a national assessment for Bolivia (Velez-Liendo, <em>et al</em>. 2009). Unfortunately priority actions highlighted by some of these programs have not been undertaken. Such is the case for the three key areas identified for connectivity conservation within the Venezuelan Action Plan (Yerena <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/> <br/> Knowledge regarding the species ecology has improved, with information about home range sizes, movement patterns and population sizes for some locations in Peru, Ecuador and Colombia (Rodríguez <em>et al</em>. 2003, Monsalve Dam <em>et al</em>. 2010, Sánchez-Mercado <em>et al</em>. 2010, García-Rangel 2012). Nevertheless, in order to develop robust conservation actions, further efforts regarding population sizes and limiting factors are required. Current and future research need to focus on populations, habitat and connectivity, human dimensions, and climate change effects on both the ecology of the species and human-bear conflict               (Rodríguez <em>et al.</em> 2003, Jorgenson and Sandoval 2005, Yerena <em>et al.</em> 2007, Monsalve Dam <em>et al.</em> 2010, Velez-Liendo and Paisley 2010, García-Rangel 2012).&#160;Finally, it is important to encourage conservation initiatives to focus on a more holistic and creative approach where the needs of the species and the people inhabiting the Andes mountain range are jointly considered (García-Rangel 2012).</p>",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

Although lacking direct empirical estimates of population trends, country experts from the IUCN SSC Bear Specialist Group made subjective estimates of rates of population loss over three generations (30 years in the past, a 30-year window overlapping the present, and 30 years into the future) based on dwindling geographic ranges, loss and degradation of habitat, and high levels of exploitation. Weighting each country’s estimate of population change by the country’s areal proportion of the geographic range yielded an overall estimated decline of ~35% for the past 30 years, and ~40% or more for time periods including the future. Thus, this species meets the criterion A threshold for Vulnerable.<br/> <br/> Deforestation rates and reported high volumes of hunting and trade throughout the Sun Bear range form the basis for this assessment. Sun Bears are forest dependent species, and, thus area of forest loss is directly linked with population decline. Southeast Asia, which comprises nearly all of the species global range, has experienced a higher relative rate of forest loss over the past 30 years than any other part of the world (Sodhi <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2010; Miettinen <em>et al</em>. 2011; Margono <em>et al</em>. 2012, 2014; Dong <em>et al.</em> 2014). Extent of occurrence (EOO) appears to be shrinking, with just a few individuals left in China and Bangladesh, and rapid decline in Vietnam (projected 50–80% decline in the next 30 years). Area of occupancy (AOO) is declining and becoming increasingly fragmented, most noticeably in Borneo and Sumatra. In mainland Southeast Asia, some patches in southern Myanmar, central Thailand, southern Cambodia, and southern Vietnam appear to be completely isolated. Deforestation and degradation is expected to continue into the future. Coupled with this, and the persistent trade in bears and bear parts, sun bear populations are expected to decline even more rapidly in the future.</p>","<p>                   </p><p>Sun Bears are a forest-dependent species, favouring interior mature and/or heterogeneously structured primary forests (Augeri 2005). There are two ecologically distinct categories of tropical forest that comprise their natural range, distinguished by differences in climate, phenology, and floristic composition: seasonal evergreen and deciduous forest in the mainland (north of the Isthmus of Kra) and aseasonal evergreen rainforest in Malaysia, Sumatra and Borneo.<br/> <br/> In the far northern range limit in northeast India, Sun Bears were recorded in mountainous areas of subtropical climate (Higgins 1932, Chauhan and Singh 2006, Choudhury 2011). Their range may be limited farther north by colder climate and unsuitable habitat in the Himalayan sub-region, and limited farther northwest by competition with Sloth Bears (<em>Melursus ursinus</em>; Steinmetz, 2011). In Bangladesh, Northeast India, and throughout the rest of the mainland range (Myanmar, Thailand, Lao PDR, Cambodia and Vietnam) Sun Bears are sympatric with Asiatic Black Bears, inhabiting seasonal ecosystems with a long dry season (3-7 months), during which rainfall is &lt;100 mm per month. Seasonal forest types usually occur in a mosaic that includes semi-evergreen, mixed deciduous, dry dipterocarp, and montane evergreen forest (Nguyen Xuan Dang 2006, Scotson 2010, Steinmetz 2011, Gray and Phan 2011). In Thailand, Sun Bears and Asiatic Black Bears use many of the same habitats and have extensive overlap in diet.&#160; However, in montane forests &gt;1,200 m elevation (where ground cover is sparse) Asiatic Black Bears are more abundant than sun bears, possibly due to the lower abundance of invertebrate prey (Vinitpornsawan <em>et al.</em> 2006, Steinmetz <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/> <br/> In southern Thailand and Peninsular Malaysia, Sun Bears inhabit tropical evergreen moist forest and lowland or hill dipterocarp forest (Kawanishi and Sunquist 2004, Nazeri <em>et al</em>. 2014). Tropical evergreen rainforest comprises the Sun Bear’s main habitat in Borneo, Sumatra, and Peninsular Malaysia. Climate is generally constant in this region, with high annual rainfall that is relatively evenly distributed throughout the year. The Sundaic tropical evergreen rainforest includes a wide diversity of forest types used by sun bears, including lowland and hill dipterocarp, peat swamp, freshwater swamp, limestone/karst hills and lower to sub-montane forest.<strong> </strong>Of these habitats,<strong> </strong>in Borneo and Sumatra, sun bear abundance (based on signs and camera trap records) was highest in primary lowland dipterocarp forest (Davies and Payne 1982, McConkey and Galetti 1999, Wong <em>et al.</em> 2002, Fredriksson 2005, Augeri 2005, Linkie <em>et al.</em> 2007, Wong and Linkie 2013). Sun Bears also occur in mangrove forest, although their occurrence in this forest type probably depends on proximity to other more favoured habitats (G. Fredriksson, pers. obs).<br/> <br/> Broadly speaking, Sun Bears seem to be more abundant in lower elevations (Augeri 2005, Steinmetz 2011) but there is wide variation throughout the range. In India, Sun Bears were detected up to 3,000 m (Choudhury 2011) and occupancy was higher in high elevations, possibly because low elevations were more degraded (Karanth <em>et al.</em> 2009). In western Thailand, Sun Bears occurred primarily below 1,200 m (Vinitpornsawan <em>et al</em>. 2006) but have been observed up to 2,100 m in neighbouring Myanmar (Htun 2006), and up to 1,600 m in Lao PDR (Steinmetz <em>et al.</em> 1999). <span class=""MsoCommentReference"">In Indonesia, sun bears occur primarily below 1,200 m although have been observed at 2,140 m in Sumatra (Augeri 2005, Wong and Linkie 2012). In Peninsular Malaysia Sun Bears were primarily below 1,200 m (Nazeri <em>et al.</em> 2014), whereas in Sarawak (Malaysian Borneo) Sun Bears were more frequently encountered at higher altitudes, though this might be the result of high levels of hunting and logging activities at lower altitudes, both having negative impacts on Sun Bear densities (Brodie <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/> <br/> In highly disturbed landscapes, habitat use may be driven more by hunting and habitat disturbance levels than by natural influences.<strong> </strong>For example,<strong> </strong>in the World Heritage Dong Phayayen-Khao Yai forest complex in Thailand, illegal rosewood (<em>Dalbergia </em>spp.) logging may cause Sun Bears to avoid interior forest, due to intensive logger traffic, most of whom are armed with guns (D. Ngoprasert, King Mongkut's University of Technology, pers. comm.). In some sites Sun Bears seem to prefer interior primary forest and density increases with increasing distance to roads and human settlements (Linkie <em>et al.</em> 2007, Nazeri <em>et al.</em> 2012, Wong and Linkie 2013). However, sun bears also use selectively logged areas (Wong <em>et al</em>. 2004, Meijaard <em>et al</em>. 2005, Linkie <em>et al</em>. 2007), but their occurrence in newly logged forest (&lt;10 years) is much lower compared to forest that was logged more distantly in the past (Brodie <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/> <br/> Sun Bears have been observed in plantations (oil palm, sugar palm), agricultural lands (sweetcorn, cucumber, pumpkin, sesame), orchards (coconut, durian, banana, jackfruit, snakefruit, pineapple, apple) and near forest edges (Nomura <em>et al.</em> 2004, Augeri 2005, Fredriksson 2005, Wong <em>et al.</em> 2012, Chea 2013, Sethy and Chauhan, 2013, Scotson <em>et al</em>. 2014), where they may be considered pests. Scattered reports of predation on livestock (goats; Sumatra, Wong <em>et al.</em> 2015) and chickens (Borneo, Fredriksson 2005) exist. Crop raiding tends to occur most often during harvest time and is concentrated in areas where crops are planted along the forest edge (Santiapillai and Santiapillai 1996, Fredriksson 2005, Scotson <em>et al.</em> 2014). There is no evidence that Sun Bears can survive in deforested or agricultural areas in the absence of nearby forest (Augeri 2005). It is known that they can derive some nutritional benefit from consuming oil palm fruits (Nomura <em>et al.</em> 2004, Chea 2013), but it is doubtful that they could subsist on this, without other foods and cover provided by nearby natural forest.<br/> <br/> Sun Bears are generalist omnivores, feeding primarily on termites, ants, beetle larvae, stingless bee larvae and honey, and a large variety of fruit species. Figs (<em>Ficus</em> spp.) are particularly important when available (McConkey and Galetti 1999, Wong <em>et al.</em> 2002, Augeri 2005, Fredriksson <em>et al.</em> 2006a). Occasionally, growth shoots of certain palms and some species of flowers are consumed (Fredriksson <em>et al.</em> 2006a), but otherwise vegetative matter rarely occurs in the diet. The Indonesian name for Sun Bears translates to ‘honey bear’ presumably because they are so attracted to honey. Their massive jaw muscles and disproportionately large canines (for the size of their head; Christiansen 2007, 2008) enable them to bite through the bark/stem of hardwood trees to consume stingless bees nests and honey, and their long tongues are used to extract insects and their products from crevices. Their long sharp claws enable them to dig easily into the ground and break into rotting logs (Wong <em>et al.</em> 2002). In Bornean lowland forests, fruits of the families Moraceae, Burseraceae and Myrtaceae make up more than 50% of the fruit diet (Fredriksson <em>et al.</em> 2006a), whereas in western Thailand fruits of Lauraceae, Fagaceae, Leguminosae, Labiatae, and Sapindaceae are the most commonly consumed (Vinitpornsawan <em>et al.</em> 2006, Steinmetz <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/> <br/> There is no evidence of Sun Bears hibernating, presumably because of year-round food availability across their range. There is also no evidence of parturient females entering a prolonged period of fasting, as do other bears species. Female bears use cavities of either standing or fallen large hollow trees as birthing sites. Both diurnal and nocturnal behaviour has been documented. Average home range estimates from Borneo and Peninsular Malaysia range from 7 km² to 27 km², respectively, with daily movements affected by food availability (Wong <em>et al.</em> 2004, Fredriksson 2012, Cheah 2013).<br/> <br/> Little is known about social structure or reproduction. Sun Bears are largely solitary, except when with offspring. But they occasionally occur in pairs, and may congregate to feed from large fruiting trees. Faecal steroids from wild Sun Bears in Indonesia and from captive Sun Bears in European and American zoos indicated that Sun Bears are polyestrous, a seasonal breeders, usually producing a single cub (Schwarzenberger <em>et al.</em> 2004, Frederick <em>et al</em>. 2012).</p>","<p>Sun Bears are threatened primarily by deforestation and commercial hunting, which occurs to varying degrees throughout the range (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 2012, Stibig <em>et al.</em> 2014). Killing due to human-bear conflicts is an additional threat, although less obvious in its impact.<br/> <br/> Active trade in wild Sun Bears and their parts (Foley <em>et al.</em> 2011, Burgess <em>et al.</em> 2014) is one of the two most serious threats to Sun Bear populations. Commercial poaching of Sun Bears was reported by regional experts in the Bear Specialist Group to be a moderate to major threat in all range countries except Brunei, for which there are no data (see also Meijaard 1999, Nea and Nong 2006, Nguyen 2006, Htun 2006, Tumbelaka and Fredriksson 2006, Wong 2006, Krishnasamy and Shepherd 2014). In Thailand, local hunters in one area estimated that commercial poaching reduced the abundance of Sun Bears by more than 40% in 20 years (Steinmetz <em>et al</em>. 2006). Poaching pressure is increasing within some Thai Protected Areas, based on encounter rates of poaching signs and poachers (Steinmetz and Ngoprasert, unpubl. data), though bears are not usually targeted as much as other species. In northeastern India, where Sun Bear populations occur naturally at low densities, bears are still caught and poaching is said to have reached ""critical"" levels (Chauhan and Singh 2006, Sethy and Chauhan 2012). In southern Lao PDR, sign surveys indicate that Sun Bear populations have been reduced to extremely low levels relative to other sites in Southeast Asia, with declines attributed to historically high poaching levels (Scotson 2012).<br/> <br/> Of major concern is a widespread trend of wildlife snaring throughout much of the Sun Bear range. In northeastern Lao PDR, hunters use a snaring method that specifically targets bears and threatens to wipe out local populations (Scotson and Hunt 2012). Large and small mammal snares were detected in numerous protected areas throughout the county. Although not always specifically targeting bears this represents a major ongoing threat (Scotson and Brocklehurst 2013). Farmers affected by wildlife crop damage frequently set snares around the perimeter of crop fields (Fredriksson 2005), and in some instances catch bears (Hunt and Scotson 2011, Scotson <em>et al</em>. 2014). In Peninsular Malaysia and Indonesia camera traps increasingly record bears with missing paws (apparent snare injuries) and in a radio collaring study in Peninsular Malaysia, three out of five captured Sun Bears had missing paws (Cheah 2013), indicating high snaring pressure using cable snares.<br/> <br/> Enforcement of domestic and international wildlife laws is severely lacking in most cases and is failing to deter illegal bear trade (Shepherd and Nijman 2008, Foley <em>et al</em>. 2011, Burgess <em>et al</em>. 2014). Low risk of being prosecuted and high potential profits mean that the incentive to poach bears is very high. The value of bear parts on the illegal wildlife market has increased notably over the past two decades (Livingstone and Shepherd 2014).<br/> <br/> Other motivations for killing bears include preventing damage to crops and livestock (Fredriksson 2005, Scotson <em>et al.</em> 2014, Wong <em>et al</em>. 2014), subsistence use such as wild meat consumption (Krishnasamy and Shepherd 2014), and fear of bears near villages. The rapid loss and fragmentation of forests across the Sun Bear range may bring bears closer to humans and thus increase the likelihood of human-bear interactions (Fredriksson 2005). In Lao PDR, where bear crop raiding occurs annually in many parts of the country, farmers showed a general reluctance to report crop raiding events to management authorities and may be more inclined to hunt bears that enter fields instead of seeking non-lethal mitigation methods (Scotson <em>et al.</em> 2014). Incidences of sun bears attacking humans are rare and usually result as an act of self defence—under normal circumstances, Sun Bears avoid humans.<br/> <br/> As Sun Bears are a forest dependent species, population declines are likely to be associated with deforestation rates. Deforestation increased dramatically during 1990-2005 and in recent times Southeast Asia has experienced the highest annual rate of forest cover change in the world&#160; (Sodhi <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2010; Miettinen <em>et al</em>. 2011; Margono <em>et al</em>. 2012, 2014; Dong <em>et al</em>. 2014). Some estimates project extremely high loss of natural forests and of biodiversity of up to 75% and 85% respectively by 2100 (Sodhi <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2010). Rate of forest loss is not uniform throughout the range, however, with some discrepancies among published estimates of forest lost due to varying analytical techniques (Dong <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/> <br/> Analyses by Stibig <em>et al</em>. (2014) indicated that Southeast Asia lost 11.9% of its forest cover during 1990-2000. The Sundaic region (Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei) experienced the highest rate of loss (Miettinen <em>et al</em>. 2011; Margono 2012, 2014; Sodhi <em>et al</em>. 2014); Stibig <em>et al</em>. (2014) calculated 13% of forest was lost during 1990-2000, and Miettinen <em>et al</em>. 2011 estimated a further 9.9% lost during 2000-2010. By 2012, primary forest loss in Indonesia was estimated to be double that in Brazil (Margono 2014). Hansen <em>et al</em>. (2009) estimated that in Sumatra and Kalimantan combined, 23.5% of total forest was lost from 1990-2005, with loss of lowland forest alone more than 40%. Brunei seems to be impacted the least, although deforestation and forest degradation are still evident (Bryan <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/> <br/> Deforestation in the Sundaic region is largely attributed to extensive clear-cutting for plantations (i.e., oil palm, rubber), unsustainable logging practices (Brown <em>et al</em>. 2005), legal and illegal logging, and forest fires (Meijaard <em>et al</em>. 2005, Tumbelaka and Fredriksson 2006, Wong 2006, Wong and Linkie 2012). Conversion of natural habitat to oil palm plantations is most extensive on Borneo and Sumatra (Miettinen <em>et al</em>. 2011; Wicke <em>et al</em>. 2011; Margono <em>et al.</em> 2012, 2014). Protected areas are not exempt from deforestation; 40% of the forest lost in Indonesia during 2000-2012 was lost in areas where logging is restricted (i.e. national parks and protected forests, Margano <em>et al</em>. 2014), and in Kalimantan alone, 56% of protected lowland forests were cleared from 1985-2001 (Curran <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/> <br/> Human-caused fires throughout the Sundaic region are also diminishing habitat quality and quantity for sun bears, especially in Malaysia and Indonesia. These fires are more extensive during El Niño-related droughts. Between 1997-2006 a total of 16.2 million ha of Borneo’s landmass (21% of total land surface area) were affected by fires (Langner and Siegert 2009). On Borneo, periods of prolonged drought have disrupted fruiting patterns (e.g., Harrison 2000), which in combination with reduced habitat availability due to clearing for agriculture, logging and fires, resulted in starvation among sun bears, even in protected primary forest areas (Wong <em>et al.</em> 2005, Fredriksson <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/> <br/> Given the Sun Bear’s affinity for primary and relatively mature, heterogeneously structured forests, along with its strongly frugivorous diet, such forest loss and fragmentation will exert significant effects on the bear’s regional and global populations along with its genetic and demographic structure and viability (Augeri 2005). Based on deforestation rates and increasingly fragmented range, and evidence of increasing trade of bears and their parts, it is likely that many isolated populations face a real threat of extirpation.</p>","Regional experts reported declines of Sun Bears in eight of ten current range countries (trends in two other current range countries—Brunei and Bangladesh—are unknown). There are few reliable estimates of Sun Bear population size and few studies have quantified population trends. Previous attempts to extrapolate population size from anecdotal information on bear density derived from occasional bear sightings and sign surveys (e.g., Davies and Payne 1981, Meijaard 2001) have led to unreliable estimates (Garshelis 2002).<br/><br/>A camera-based mark-recapture survey in Thailand estimated population densities of 4.3 (95% Cl 1.6-11.6) and 5.9 (95% Cl 2.3-15.4) per 100 km² in two sites within Khao Yai National Park (Ngoprasert <em>et al.</em> 2012). In southern Sumatra, in Harapan Rainforest, a camera-based study estimated a density of Sun Bears of 26 bears per 100 km², 4-5 times higher than density estimates from Thailand (Lee 2014, unpubl. data). The methods used to estimate density in Thailand and Sumatra differed (capture-recapture and gas-model, respectively), but if results are comparable, they suggest substantially higher density of Sun Bears in the Sundaic portion of their range than on the mainland (where in part they coexist and potentially compete with Asiatic Black Bears).<br/><br/>In Thailand, Sun Bears have declined in some sites, for example Khao Yai National Park where camera trap photo encounter rates declined by nearly two-thirds from 0.73 per 100 days (over the period 1999-2003) to 0.27 (2003-2007) (Lynam <em>et al.</em> 2003, Jenks <em>et al.</em> 2011). But other populations seem to be doing better, with photo encounter rates stable in Kuiburi Natonal Park and Thung Yai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuary (Steinmetz, unpublished data). An earlier systematic mammal status assessment study with local people in Thung Yai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuary, Thailand, estimated that Sun Bear numbers declined by more than 40% in a 20-year period from 1984-2004 (Steinmetz <em>et al.</em> 2006). But improved protection and community engagement since then appears to have had a positive effect. In neighbouring Lao PDR, interviews in rural communities adjacent to bear habitat recorded widespread population declines (Scotson 2010, 2012). In west Sumatra, repeat camera trap surveys using an occupancy-based sampling framework revealed a decline in Sun Bear populations (5%/year) in response to high levels of deforestation (9%/year in the most deforested site) over 7-year period (Wong <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/><br/>Sun Bear populations can recover in previously extirpated areas, given a nearby source population. In Indonesian Borneo (Kalimantan), sign transects were used to monitor relative abundance of Sun Bears in forest affected by fires and adjacent unburned forest from 2000 to 2010. In the unburned forest, Sun Bear density remained stable. In the recently burned forest, Sun Bear sign density was close to zero post fires, but in 10 years reached 65% of the sign densities in adjacent unburned forest (Fredriksson 2012).",Decreasing,"The historic range of this species (within 500 years) extended across much of Southeast Asia, from Borneo and Sumatra north to at least Yunnan Province, China. Fossil records from the Pleistocene have been found much farther north (Erdbrink 1953). Assam, in northeast India, marks the northwestern confirmed historic range limit (Wroughton 1916, Higgins 1932). Reports of Sun Bears formerly occupying the Terai of Nepal (Hodgson 1844) appear to be erroneous. In the northeast, the range extends to northeastern Vietnam (Erdbrink 1953). The southern-most range limit is Indonesia; there are no records of Sun Bears ever occurring farther east than Borneo. Records exist from the Island of Java from middle-late Pleistocene (Erdbrink 1953) but there is no evidence of occurrence there within historic times.<br/><br/>In present day, Sun Bears occur patchily through much of the former range, and have been locally extirpated from many areas. This is particularly evident in Thailand, where bears are mainly limited to a patchwork of protected areas separated by expanses of agriculture (Kanchanasakha <em>et al.</em> 2010). The range extends westward to southern Bangladesh and northeastern India (West Garo Hills, Meghalaya), northwards to eastern Arunachal Pradesh (Chauhan 2006; Choudhury 2011; Sethy and Chauhan 2012, 2013) and northern Myanmar. The Sun Bear's range is sympatric with Asiatic Black Bears (<em>Ursus thibetanus</em>) across mainland Southeast Asia to about 9°N latitude (in peninsular Thailand), south of which Asiatic Black Bears do not occur. In the Sundaic region, its range extends south and eastwards to Sumatra and Borneo respectively (Steinmetz 2011).<br/><br/>In mainland Southeast Asia Sun Bears appear to exhibit a natural population gradient from the north to south being most abundant in the southern regions and becoming less common towards the northern edge of their range (Steinmetz 2011). A north to south gradient probably applies to the entire range as well, with population abundance lower in mainland Southeast Asia than in Sundaic Southeast Asia. This is based on higher population densities (Ngoprasert <em>et al</em>. 2012, Lee 2014 unpubl. data) and higher sign densities (Steinmetz <em>et al.</em> 2011, Fredriksson 2012) in the Sundaic region compared to the mainland. This gradient of abundance is presumed to be natural and unrelated to human exploitation as it was apparent in historical times (e.g., in India, Higgins 1932) and is also reflected by the relative frequency of fossil records in the mainland and Sundaic regions (Vos and Long 1993, Tougard 2001, Meijaard 2004). As such, Sun Bears are rare in the western and northern edges of their range in southern Bangladesh and Northeast India. There are no records of Sun Bears north of the Brahmaputra River in Assam or Arunachal Pradesh (Chauhan 2006, Islam <em>et al.</em> 2013, Choudhury 2011). Sun Bears are relatively less common in the northern highlands of Lao Peoples&#160;Democratic Republic (hereafter Lao PDR), compared with the southern region (Scotson 2010, 2012). Current distribution in northeastern Myanmar is uncertain due to political instability in the area but presumes to be in decline (Saw Htun, Wildlife Conservation Society, pers. comm. 2014). The northeastern range ends in eastern Vietnam, at the Red River, limited presumably by colder climates and unfavourable habitats.<br/><br/>Sun Bears were thought to be extirpated in Bangladesh until recent confirmed records in 2014 and 2015 (Anwarul Islam, WildTeam pers. comm. 2015). It is possible that a population in a southern Bangladesh is maintained through immigration from core areas in western Myanmar.&#160;Likewise, the existence of this species in China remains in doubt.&#160;Surveys in the most likely regions (remnant lowland natural forests) of Yunnan Province confirmed their absence in all but one small area (&lt;600 km²) that could not be surveyed (Wen and Wang 2013). In 2016, video footage of a Sun Bear was obtained from a camera trap in this area, indicating the presence of at least one bear, &lt;1 km from the Myanmar border (Li <em>et al</em>. 2017).&#160; It is unknown whether there is a transboundary population, or just a few individuals living near the border. Nevertheless, this represents the first confirmed record of the species in China in 45 years. Sun Bears most likely occurred in what is now Singapore, but were extirpated due to the widespread deforestation that occurred in the 1800s and 1900s (Corlett 1992, Brooks <em>et al</em>. 2003).","<p>Sun Bears are commonly poached for their gall bladders (i.e., bile) and paws; the former is used as a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and the latter as an expensive delicacy. Traditionally, bear bile was used to treat a wide range of ailments and for promoting general good health and strength. Use was largely subsistence based, until around the mid 1900s, when international trade routes opened and commercial interest in bear bile began to grow. Bear bile forms a component of traditional Chinese medicine but has not commonly been part of traditional medicinal practices in Southeast Asian cultures. Thus, it is not typically used locally, but rather sold to consuming markets. Sun bears (or parts thereof) were one of the most commonly seized bear species in Asia from 2000-2011 (Burgess <em>et al</em>. 2014). Illegal import of Sun Bears or parts has been detected in the USA, New Zealand, UK and France, and illegal exportation from China, Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, Singapore, Lao PDR, Indonesia and the USA (Foley <em>et al.</em> 2011, Burgess <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/> <br/> Domestic hunting and trade of Sun Bears is illegal throughout the entire range except Sarawak, where it is permitted under license (although no license has ever been issued; Krishnasamy and Shepherd, 2014). Sun bears have been listed in Appendix I of CITES since 1979 and international commercial trade is therefore illegal. Monitoring illegal bear trade in Asia has been difficult and little quantitative information has been collected on the scale of trade or trends over time. However, records of perceived high volume of use and trade have existed for decades (e.g., Caldecott 1988, Meijaard 1999, Pereira 2002, Foley <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011), and the high and increasing value of parts indicate that trade is still booming. In Lao PDR, trading values for wild cubs increased 2.6 times and gall bladder values increased 180 times from the early 1990s to 2013 (data for Sun Bears and Asiatic Black Bears combined; Livingstone and Shepherd 2014). Prices vary widely throughout the range. In Lao PDR, in 2014, poachers sold cubs for ~$US 600 and gall bladders ~US$ 700. In Southern Yunnan, in 2014, a Sun Bear carcass from Myanmar, with gall bladder intact, was traded for ~US$ 4,000 (Roshan Guharajan pers. comm. 2015). In Japan and South Korea, values for gallbladders can exceed the value of gold (INTERPOL 2014). In Cambodia, annual confiscation rates of sun bears more than doubled from 1998 to 2008, with a ratio of around 3:1 Sun Bears to Asiatic Black Bears confiscated. Sun Bear confiscations decreased in subsequent years, although given the prevalent high value of bears this may be due to declining bear populations and trade becoming more secretive, as opposed to reduced trade (Broadis 2011). <br/> <br/> Sun Bear cubs (wild caught), although mostly traded as pets, are also ‘farmed’ for their bile in commercial bear farms in China, Lao PDR, Myanmar and Vietnam. However, this industry is by far dominated by Asiatic Black Bears and the proportion of Sun Bears held on farms is relatively small (Foley <em>et al.</em> 2011, Livingstone and Shepherd 2014). Indeed, Sun Bears seem to produce much lower levels of the medicinal bile acids (ursodeoxycholic acid) than found in Asiatic Black Bears (Hagey <em>et al.</em> 1993). Nevertheless, Sun Bears were observed in small private bile farm enterprises in Vietnam (Nguyen 2006, Foley <em>et al</em>. 2011). Proponents of the bear farming industry claim that the availability of farmed bile will satisfy the growing demand for bear bile and gall bladders within Southeast and East Asian (China, Korea, Japan, Mongolia and the Russian Far East) markets. However, there is no evidence that this is the case; instead, there is evidence for the opposite - that the demand for wild products continues to rise in the presence of bear farming (Liu <em>et al.</em> 2011, Livingstone and Shepherd 2014). Furthermore, mortality rates of farmed bears are high and farms in Southeast Asia rely on wild cubs to replenish their stock. There may be complex interactions between the markets for farmed and wild sourced bear bile, and the availability of farmed bile may drive up the value and demand for the wild product (Dutton <em>et al</em>. 2011). As such, the IUCN has called for a situation analysis to investigate the true nature of the relationship between the market for farmed bile and the market for wild bile (Garshelis and Scotson 2012).</p>",Terrestrial,"<p>Measures to reduce habitat loss and poaching throughout the entire Sun Bear range are key actions needed to conserve Sun Bears. In areas with the highest deforestation rates, such as Indonesia and Malaysia (two globally leading oil palm producers), immediate action should be taken to protect remaining high conservation value forests from conversion to other land-uses, eliminate unsustainable logging, and effectively manage forest fires. Additionally, new protected areas should be established and effectively managed in order to preempt land conversion (Augeri 2005, Tumbelaka and Fredriksson 2006, Wong 2006) and protect critical Sun Bear habitat. For example, in Peninsular Malaysia, Nazeri <em>et al</em>. (2012), using MaxEnt modelling, reported that Sun Bears favour dense tropical evergreen forest over cultivated landscapes and areas in close proximity to roads. Of habitat deemed ‘highly suitable’ only 22% is contained within protected areas. These findings suggest that the present geographical extent of protected areas in Peninsular Malaysia provide insufficient coverage of habitat crucial for conserving Sun Bears.<br/> <br/> In conjunction with primary forest protection, degraded habitats and forest remnants in human-modified landscapes should be enhanced, through reforestation programs, corridor planning and elevated protected status. Additionally, there is the need to establish buffer zones and prevent further agricultural expansion surrounding protected areas. Achieving these measures requires increased levels of resources, the support of conservation constituencies in civil society, and strengthened government commitments to conservation. In Malaysia and Indonesia, the two main producers of palm oil, it will be difficult to stop forest conversion, given the impacts of their economies in the world markets. Furthermore, in present conditions the effective management of already established protected areas, let alone addition of new protected areas and land management outside of protected areas, has proven a highly challenging task.<br/> <br/> Sun Bears are legally protected domestically and internationally from hunting and trade throughout most of their range. However, deficiencies in law enforcement are recognized as major ongoing weaknesses (Burgess <em>et al</em>. 2014). Some successes are evident where dedicated agencies operate with steady technical and funding support. For example, in Cambodia, a dedicated Wildlife Protection Mobile Unit, run by Forestry Officials and Military and funded by international NGOs, has confiscated more than 100 Sun Bears and Asiatic Black Bears since 1998 (Broadis 2011). Similar initiatives exist in parts of Malaysia and Indonesia but action is limited. Establishment of more focused wildlife protection/crime units is recommended for other range countries, where possible funded by local authorities responsible for wildlife law enforcement.<br/> <br/> Reduction of mortality by clearing of snares from bear habitat is urgently needed throughout much of the range, and long term measures are needed to prevent the problem reoccurring. Efforts to do so are underway in several protected areas throughout the region, by park authorities often in collaboration with foreign NGOs. However, these projects usually do not extend throughout a protected area and can face difficulties in maintaining long-term funding and political support.<br/> <br/> To combat the growing impacts of human-bear conflict, funding and technical support is needed to promote non-lethal mitigation, especially in low-income regions where the incentive to hunt bears may outweigh incentives to stop conflict from occurring.<br/> <br/> Non-government organizations (NGO’s) have established bear dedicated rescue centres in Cambodia, Vietnam, Lao, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia with the primary aim of providing sanctuary to bears confiscated from the illegal wildlife trade. Bear rescue centres can play a key role in raising local awareness on the threats to sun bears and the conservation value of ecological services provided by bear habitat. Some centres operate dedicated outreach teams, providing structured learning programs that can reach tens of thousands of people each year. Likewise, centres support capacity building of local conservationists, and facilitate <em>in-situ</em> and <em>ex-situ</em> research and conservation. Rehabilitation of ex-captive Sun Bears is another potential role. However this is rare and fraught with challenges, as most potential release sites are still threatened by forest loss and poaching. For example, in Cambodia, a pilot project to rehabilitate two Sun Bears that had been confiscated from the illegal wildlife trade ended after both bears were trapped in snares within two months, despite over two years of intensive snare-patrolling in the area prior to the release (M. Hunt, Free the Bears, pers. comm).<br/> <br/> Ultimately, reducing the trade in bear parts would be one of the most highly beneficial steps for the persistence and recovery of Sun Bears throughout their range, especially as trade is increasingly moving towards the last strongholds for Sun Bears in Malaysia and Indonesia (Shepherd and Shepherd 2010, Krishnasamy and Shepherd 2014). Understanding consumer motivation, and educating and changing the behaviour of potential consumers of bear products, could be an incredibly effective tool. This is especially important given that law enforcement is generally underfunded and unfocused.<br/> <br/>Increasing our scientific knowledge of Sun Bear ecology, population distribution, status and effects of threats is also needed. Aside from a now outdated global Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan for this species (Servheen <em>et al.</em> 1999), only one range country (India) has developed a National Conservation Action Plan for Sun Bears (Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012). Range mapping efforts, ongoing since 2006, have suffered from lack of presence data. But in 2014, the Bear Specialist Group mapped the current range-wide distribution of Sun Bears based on collation of more than 2000 presence points from throughout the range and with input from numerous experts. This has resulted in the most up to date range map for the species. The veracity of Probable range depicted by experts remains unclear. Habitat modelling approaches (e.g., Maxent; Nazeri <em>et al.</em> 2012) generate maps of potential distribution and may thereby help direct field surveys to promising locations to ascertain bear status; however such models are often generated with bear presence data from a small area and extrapolated broadly, and should thus be treated with caution. There remain large areas for which sun bear status is uncertain, most noticeably in Myanmar, where further research is needed.<br/> <br/> Furthermore, it is important to establish the geographic distribution of Sun Bears at finer scales, taking into consideration habitat and fragmentation within and between countries, in order to better direct conservation actions and monitor habitat changes accurately (i.e., forest loss and fragmentation).<br/> <br/> In 2006 The Bear Specialist Group mapped important habitat blocks for long-term survival of Sun Bears (Bear Conservation Units-BCUs). Anti-poaching efforts and forest boundary protection efforts within BCUs should be a high priority. Presently no BCUs receive support just for bears, but BCUs in some countries coincide with protected areas that receive substantial conservation support for other species (such as tigers), and bears benefit as a result (Steinmetz and Garshelis 2014). The possibilities to link bear conservation with that of other species should be explored and promoted more widely.<br/> <br/> Efforts are currently underway to develop a standard methodology with which to monitor occurrence, relative abundance and trends of Asian bear populations through repeat sign transects. To this end, methodologies to distinguish Sun Bear claw marks from Asiatic Black Bear claw marks and to age claw marks have been developed (Steinmetz and Garshelis 2008, 2010). Surveys using this technique have been completed in Lao PDR and are planned for Vietnam and Cambodia. Trends in bear occurrence and relative abundance within the aforementioned BCUs should be monitored using standardized sign surveys and camera trapping by local government, communities, and NGOs. Results of such monitoring could indicate which management or ecological conditions promote successful bear conservation, and which do not, and provide a means to assess the results of conservation efforts (e.g., future range expansion and/or increased bear density being indicative of effective conservation efforts). Additional field studies would also be helpful in this regard, as few intensive studies have been conducted on Sun Bears.</p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

While Black Rhino numbers have more than doubled since bottoming out in the mid 1990s (due to increased protection and enhanced biological management to keep more subpopulations productive), the species qualifies as CR due to the scale of the decline in numbers over the past three generations as a result of very heavy poaching in the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s. Three generations ago (i.e., 44 years back in 1973) the point estimate for Black Rhinos was 37,807 rhinos and despite numbers more than doubling from a low of 2,354 were only 5,495 as of end 2017. This represents a decline over three generations of 85% qualifying as CR under criterion A2. An 83% reduction was projected one year (based on data up to and including 2017) into the future (from 1974–2018). This reduction was the same as observed in point estimates for these dates. The next worse projected reduction in point estimates over three generations was when modelling two years ahead from 1975–2019 (an 81% reduction from an estimated 28,674 in 1975). Numbers continue to increase at a continental-level although at a reduced rate due to the escalation of poaching since 2007.</p>","Black Rhino occur in a wide variety of habitats from desert areas in Namibia to wetter wooded areas. The highest densities of rhinos are found in savannas on nutrient-rich soils and in succulent Valley Bushveld areas. Black Rhino are browsers and favour small acacia's and other palatable woody species (<em>Grewia</em>'s<span style=""font-style: italic;"">,</span> Euphorbiaceae species, etc.) as well as palatable herbs and succulents. However, because of high levels of secondary plant chemicals, much woody plant browse (especially many evergreen species) in some areas is unpalatable. Failure to appreciate this, has in the past led to carrying capacities being over-estimated in some areas. Apart from plant species composition and size structure, Black Rhino carrying capacity is related to rainfall, soil nutrient status, fire histories, levels of grass interference, extent of frost and densities of other large browsers. To maintain rapid population growth rates and prevent potential habitat damage if the population overshoots carrying capacity, populations of Black Rhinos should be managed at densities below long term ecological carrying capacity (i.e., below zero growth densities). Surplus rhino that are removed from such established populations are routinely being profitably invested in new areas with suitable habitat and protection where populations can grow rapidly.","<p>Black Rhino face a variety of threats. The main threat to the species is illegal hunting (poaching) to supply the illegal international rhino horn trade. It is estimated that currently around 95% of rhino horn sourced in Africa for end user illegal markets in SE Asia are from this source (Emslie&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019). Rhino horn has traditionally had two main uses: use in Chinese medicine, and ornamental use. Recently rhino horn has become a highly prized material for making carved expensive high-status items such bowls and bangles. In the past it was also used to produce ornately carved handles for ceremonial daggers (jambiyas) worn in Yemen and some Middle East countries. Historically rhino horn was also used in traditional Chinese medicine (as a fever reducer). However, most recently it appears to be shavings from carvings that are illegally sold to the medicinal market at lower prices than worked items. While Black Rhino numbers continue to increase at a continental-level poaching has slowed overall growth. Some populations have also declined. Black rhino poaching peaked in 2015 and has been declining since. See Figure 2 and Table 2 and 3 in attached Supplementary&#160;Information&#160;file.<br/><br/>The significantly increased poaching since 2007 has greatly increased protection costs and risks to investment and staff. This has resulted in reduced incentives. Some private owners in South Africa have got rid of their rhino. If this worrying trend continues this threatens to possibly reverse the expansion of range and has the potential to also reduce conservation budgets and incentives to conserve Black Rhino privately (both those privately owned and those managed for the state on a custodianship basis (due to declining live sales and greatly increased protection costs ). For more information on threats see the joint IUCN/TRAFFIC rhino report for CITES CoP18 (Emslie <em>et al</em>. 2019 <a href=""http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/pdf_files/156/1560170144.pdf"">http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/pdf_files/156/1560170144.pdf</a>).&#160;</p><p><br/></p>","<p>Throughout most of the 20th century, the Black Rhino was the most numerous of the world's rhino species. Relentless hunting of the species and clearances of land for settlement and agriculture reduced numbers and by 1960 only an estimated 100,000 remained. Between 1960 and 1995, large-scale poaching caused a dramatic 98% collapse in numbers with numbers bottoming out in the mid 1990s. Over this period numbers only increased in South Africa and Namibia (Emslie and Brooks 1999). From 1992–1997 total numbers remained relatively stable with increases in some countries (those with the best-protected and managed populations) being cancelled out by declines in others. However, since the lows of the mid-1990s, Black Rhino numbers at a continental level have more than doubled reaching and estimated 5,495 by end 2017 (Emslie&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>&#160;2019) and 5,630 by end 2018 (Knight 2019). Figure 1 in the attached Supplementary Information documentation shows how estimated total numbers of Black Rhino have changed over the last three-generations based on best estimates of rhino numbers per subspecies per country per year going back three-generations to 1973.<br/><br/>See Supplementary&#160;Information documentation for more information on sources of data.<br/><br/>Point estimates of subspecies/genetic management cluster totals as of 31 December 2017 were (see also Table 1 in the Supplementary&#160;Information): Southern-central Black Rhino (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">D. b. minor</span>) 2,305, South-western Black Rhino (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">D. b. bicornis</span>) 2,188 and Eastern Black Rhino (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">D. b. michaeli</span>) 1,002 based on AfRSG data with assistance of Range States.

As of 2017 four Range States (South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Kenya) conserved the majority (93.9%) of remaining wild Black Rhino.</p><p><br/></p>",Increasing,"<p>There are now three remaining recognised subspecies/genetic management clusters of Black Rhino occupying different areas of Africa. Strong support for this classification has been provided by independent analyses of different genetic data sets by different researchers using different analytical methods. See Taxonomic Notes for more details. A fourth recognised subspecies <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Diceros bicornis longipes</span> once ranged through the savanna zones of central-west Africa but it is now considered to have gone Extinct in its last known habitats in northern Cameroon.<br/><br/>The other three more numerous subspecies are found in the eastern and southern African countries. Today putative <span style=""font-style: italic;"">D. b. bicornis</span> range includes Namibia, southern Angola, western Botswana, and southwestern and southeastern South Africa (up to the Kei River), although today they occur only in Namibia (the stronghold) and South Africa with a sighting of one animal in Angola and unconfirmed reports of possibly another three animals.<br/><br/><em>Diceros b. michaeli</em> was distributed from South Sudan, Ethiopia, and Somalia, through Kenya into northern-central Tanzania and Rwanda. Its current stronghold is Kenya. Smaller but growing numbers occur in northern Tanzania. The single animal that survived in Rwanda has died. One important free-ranging subpopulation occurs outside its range in a private game reserve in South Africa. Contractually, these <span style=""font-style: italic;"">D. b. michaeli</span> animals may only be translocated back to historical range and not elsewhere in South Africa. The repatriation of some of these animals back to four areas of former subspecies range in Tanzania commenced in 1997, with animals also subsequently going to found a subpopulation in Rwanda.<br/><br/><em>Diceros b. minor</em> is believed to have occurred from southern Tanzania through Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Mozambique to the northern, northwestern and northeastern parts of South Africa (north of the Mtamvuna River). It also probably occurred in southern Democratic Republic of the Congo, northern Angola, eastern Botswana, Malawi, and Eswatini. Today, its stronghold is South Africa and to a lesser extent Zimbabwe, with smaller numbers remaining in southern Tanzania. The South-central Black Rhino is now thought to be extinct in Angola and only one individual has been sighted in Mozambique since the 2008 IUCN African Rhino Specialist Group (AfRSG) meeting. The subspecies has also been reintroduced to Botswana, Malawi, Eswatini and Zambia. Based on very small sample sizes, Moodley <em>et al</em>.'s (2017) results suggested that perhaps the original historical Black Rhino&#160;that used to occur in Zambia but which had been wiped out by poaching by 1995 might be better classified as&#160;<em>D. b. michaeli </em>rather than&#160;<em>D.b.mino</em>r. However, on account of the small sample sizes, and given that the species was reintroduced with&#160;<em>D. b. minor&#160;</em>founders, and that historically Zambia had been considered&#160;<em>D. b. minor</em>&#160;range, and climate and habitats are more similar to some&#160;<em>D. b. minor</em>&#160;range; reviewers recommended that historical pre-1995 Zambian animals should continue to be allocated to&#160;<em>D. b. minor</em>&#160;for this Red List revision (as has historically been the case). With further data this may change in future. As there were still significant numbers of Black Rhinos in Zambia in the early 1970s, how these animals are allocated influences the&#160;<em>D. b. minor</em>&#160;subspecies Red List assessment which would change to Endangered under criteria A2 and A4. The <em>D. b. michaeli</em> assessment remains the same whether or not the historical animals are classified as <em>D. b. minor</em> or&#160;<em>D. b. michaeli</em>.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Note:</strong> At the request of certain members and countries,  the IUCN SSC African Rhino Specialist Group (AfRSG) has a policy of not  releasing detailed information (including maps) showing the whereabouts  and names of all rhino subpopulations for security reasons. For this  reason, only whole countries of occurrence are indicated on the range  maps produced by the AfRSG.</p>","Limited hunting of specific individual surplus Black Rhino males to further demographic and genetic metapopulation goals was only recently sanctioned by CITES.  Black Rhinos, however, are currently only openly sold in South Africa and in all other Range States Black Rhino on communal or private land are managed on a custodianship basis for the state.  Black Rhinos are primarily threatened by illegal killing for horn.<br/><br/>Live specimens for translocation are invariably taken from natural habitat with the occasional zoo animal being reintroduced.",Terrestrial,"Black Rhino have been listed on CITES Appendix I since 1977. All international commercial trade in Black Rhinos and their products have been prohibited. To help reduce illegal trade, and complement CITES international trade bans, domestic anti-trade measures and legislation were implemented in the 1990s by a number of consumer states. Effective field protection of rhino subpopulations has been critical. Many remaining rhino are now concentrated in fenced sanctuaries, conservancies, rhino conservation areas and intensive protection zones where law enforcement effort can be concentrated at effective levels. Monitoring has also provided information to guide biological management decision-making aimed at managing rhino subpopulations for rapid population growth. This has resulted in surplus animals being translocated to set up new populations both within and outside the species' former range. Following a decline in breeding performance in some areas, increased effort has recently been given to improving biological management with a view to increasing metapopulation growth rates. Increasing efforts are also being made to integrate local communities into conservation efforts (most notably in the Kunene region of Namibia). Strategically, Black Rhinos are now managed by a range of different stakeholders (private sector and state) in a number of countries increasing their long term security. In contrast to Southern White Rhino, most Black Rhino on privately owned land are managed on a custodianship basis for the state. Since CITES CoP13 limited sport hunting quotas have been approved for the two Range States with biggest populations (South Africa and Namibia). Removal of specific individuals can enhance demographic and/or genetic conservation. In addition to local and, national initiatives, there are a number of regional African rhino conservation initiatives: the SADC Rhino Management Group, the Southern African Rhino and Elephant Security Group and the East African Community Rhino Management Group. In addition to National Rhino Plans there is a Continental African Rhino Range States Conservation Plan.

156536762,11638,Leptailurus serval,Least Concern,,2019,2014-04-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Listed as Least Concern the Serval is relatively abundant and widespread.Within the last few years there are many new records of Servals implying an expanding and recolonizing of some areas (Herman <em>et al</em>. 2008, Bout 2010, Thorn <em>et al</em>. 2011, Hickisch and Aebischer 2013, Mugerwa 2013). There is no data confirming the new findings to be an enlargement of the Serval's distribution range or to be a shift of the range due to habitat loss and/or degradation, climate change or human impact, etc. However, habitat loss and degradation of wetlands is of concern, as is the level of skin trade in west Africa (Ray <em>et al</em>. 2005).<br/><br/>Servals are rare south of the Sahara in the Sahel region such as Senegal (Clement <em>et al</em>. 2007). A 2007 Mediterranean Mammal Assessment workshop classified Servals north of the Sahara as regionally Critically Endangered. The isolated population along the Mediterranean coast, where it is known to occur only in Morocco (Cuzin 2003), possibly in Algeria (K. de Smet pers. comm.), and has been reintroduced (from East African stock) in Tunisia (Hunter and Bowland 2013), is classified regionally as Critically Endangered under criterion C2a(i). There are fewer than 250 mature individuals; each subpopulation is smaller than 50 and completely isolated (from each other and from sub-Saharan African populations). The status of these populations has not been reassessed and since 2003 there are have been no new confirmed records.<br/><p><br/></p><p>  </p>","Sunquist and Sunquist (2002) stated, that the Serval has quite specific habitat requirements, so it may be locally restricted to smaller areas within its broad distribution range; it is not found in areas of rainforest or desert like habitats.<br/><br/>In sub-Saharan Africa, Servals are found in well-watered savanna long-grass environments and are particularly associated with reedbeds and other riparian vegetation types (Thiel 2011). Geertsema (1981) associated Servals with well-watered habitats like grass savannas along river reed beds and swamps, in brush and open woodlands and along the edge of forests. Van Aarde and Skinner (1986) showed significantly higher usage of riverine habitats than expected. Grimshaw <em>et al.</em> (1995) and Andama (2000) even reported Servals on high altitude moorlands and bamboo thickets. They also range up into alpine grasslands, up to 3,800 m on Mount Kilimanjaro (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Servals can penetrate dense forest along waterways and through grassy patches, but are absent from the rainforests of Central Africa, and from desert environments. In North Africa, they are found from semi-desert to cork oak forest on the Mediterranean coast (De Smet 1989, Cuzin 2003). Servals are able to tolerate agricultural areas provided cover is available (Geertsema 1985, Thiel 2011), and may also benefit from forest clearance and the resulting encroachment of savanna at the edges of the equatorial forest belt (Ray <em>et al.</em> 2005).&#160;<br/><br/>Serval specialize in preying on small mammals, in particular rodents, with birds of secondary importance, followed by reptiles and arthropods (Geertsema 1985, Bowland 1990, Thiel 2011). In Zambia Servals feed mainly on small mammals weighing in average <em>ca</em>&#160;70 g and up to 1.5 kg, which mostly are nocturnal and have a preference for grassland, wetland or habitats associated with water; birds have an average weight of <em>ca</em> 250 g, in form of smaller birds (up to 200 g) or larger Galliformes (ground dwellers up to 4 kg) (Thiel 2011).","The major threat to Serval is wetland habitat loss and degradation (Thiel 2011). Wetlands harbour comparatively high rodent densities compared with other habitat types, and form the core areas of Serval home ranges. Of secondary importance is degradation of grasslands through annual burning followed by over-grazing by domestic livestock, leading to reduced abundance of small mammals (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Ray <em>et al.</em> 2005).<br/><br/>International legal commercial trade is generally declining (Nowell and Jackson 1996), although skins are still traded in large quantities in some countries, such as Senegal, Gambia and Benin (Burnham and Di Silvestre in Hunter and Bowland 2013), and exported to North Africa (K. de Smet and F. Cuzin pers. comm. 2007). Serval pelts seen in trade in Morocco could come from elsewhere, or could indicate the species continued existence in that country (Arce and Prunier 2006). In Zambia pelts are rarely used for traditional clothing, often it is used as substitute for Leopard skins (C. Thiel pers. comm.) Trade in West Africa appears to be primarily for ceremonial or medicinal purposes. For example, they are highly valued for traditional medicine in Nigeria, where, among markets surveyed in five south-west Nigerian towns in 1994, Servals were the second most commonly offered mammalian species (Sodeinde and Soewu 1999 in Hunter and Bowland 2013).&#160;Gadsby (1991) proved the occurrence of Serval in Nigeria based on furs of this species being commonly traded on local&#160;markets. Trade evidence is used by Maisels&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2001) for occurrence in Cameroon and by Sayer and Green (1984) for occurrence in Benin.<br/><br/>Although Serval very rarely prey upon livestock (and indeed may even be beneficial to crop farmers due to their predilection for rodents), in rural areas throughout Africa, they are sometimes persecuted for taking poultry and indiscriminate predator control methods practised by pastoralists frequently kill them (L. Hunter and J. Bowland pers. comms.).<br/><br/>Sometimes other predators, such as leopards, hyaenas or lions, kill young and even adult Serval (Thiel 2011).","Outside northern Africa, where it is considered to meet the Red List Criteria for Endangered (Cuzin 2003) and the Sahel, where it is rare (Clement <em>et al.</em> 2007), the Serval is commonly recorded from most major national parks and reserves. Their status outside reserves is uncertain, but they are inconspicuous and may be common in suitable habitat as they are tolerant of farming practices provided there is cover and food available (Bowland 1990, Thiel 2011). The minimum density of Servals in optimal habitat in Ngorongoro Crater was 0.42 animals/km² (Geertsema 1985) and 0.1 animals/km² in Luambe National Park in Zambia (Thiel 2011).",Stable,"The Serval occurs widely through sub-Saharan Africa, with the exception of tropical rainforest and the Saharan desert (Nowell and Jackson 1996). North of the Sahara, there are few records from Morocco (Cuzin 2003), possible records in Algeria (K. de Smet pers. comm.), and after they went extinct in Tunisia, Servals have been reintroduced using animals of East African stock into Feijda National Park (Hunter and Bowland 2013). Servals are rare south of the Sahara in the Sahel region such as Senegal (Clement <em>et al</em>.  2007). Gadsby (1991) proved the occurrence of Serval in Nigeria based on furs of this species being commonly traded on local&#160;markets. Trade evidence is used by Maisels <em>et al</em>.

The Serval is locally extinct in the South of South Africa.<br/><br/>Within the last years there are new records of Servals implying an expanding and recolonizing of some areas, such as central South Africa, Gabon, North West province of South Africa, eastern Central African Republic, south western Uganda and central Namibia (Herrmann <em>et al.</em> 2008, Bout 2010, Thorn <em>et al.</em>  2011, Hickisch and Aebischer 2013, Mugerwa 2013, C. Thiel pers. comm).","For uses, see under Threats.",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"The Serval is listed on CITES Appendix II. Hunting is prohibited in Algeria, Botswana, Congo, Kenya, Liberia, Morocco, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa (Cape province only), and Tunisia, and hunting regulations apply in Angola, Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana, Malawi, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Tanzania, Togo and Zambia (Nowell and Jackson 1996).<br/><br/>Servals occur in a number of protected areas across their range, including: El Kala National Park (N.P.)

Odzala N.P. in Congo Republic could be a key site for protecting serval as it is the only currently known protected population in the Gabon-Congolian savanna region, which are isolated from the Miombo woodlands south of the Congo River (P. Henschel pers. comm.).<br/><br/>As Geertsema (1985) and Bowland (1990) mentioned the key to Serval conservation is Wetland conservation. For these reasons it is crucial to investigate the Serval’s habitat requirements and to create an updated action plan for this species (Thiel 2011).

160756767,6909,Dugong dugon,Vulnerable,A2bcd+4bcd,2019,2015-07-12 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Marsh <em>et al.</em> (2011) made a crude estimate of the Dugong’s extent of occurrence (EOO) as 860,000 km<sup>2</sup> based on potential habitat (waters &lt;10 m deep in its known range). This spans approximately 128,000 km of coastline across at least 37, and up to 44, countries and territories. Although the Dugong still occurs at the extremes of its range, Husar (1978) and IUCN (2009) list the Dugong as extinct in the waters of several islands including: the Maldives, the Lakshadweep Islands, Mascarene Islands of Mauritius and Rodrigues, and Taiwan (Husar 1978). Although this species may only have been vagrant at some of these islands (e.g. Taiwan, Hirasaka 1932), there is historical evidence of substantial Dugong populations off Mauritius and Rodrigues Islands; these populations were harvested in the 18th century (Cheke 1987). Cheke quotes historical accounts of a dugong fishery on Rodrigues in the 1730s. There is also anecdotal evidence that the area of occupancy (AOO) of the Dugong has declined in many parts of its range, especially along the coasts of east Africa and India. <br/><br/>The only reference site is the urban coast of Queensland between Cooktown and Brisbane, Australia where a 40 year time series of catch rates in nets set for bather protection indicates that the Catch Per Unit Effort (CPUE) in 1999 was only 3% of that in 1962 (Marsh <em>et al. </em>2005). This CPUE is considered an index of Dugong decline in the region from all causes during this period. This decline and modern aerial survey estimates of Dugong abundance were used to backcast the population in the region in the early 1960s (which would be expected to have been lower than that at the time of European settlement as a cottage commercial industry for Dugong oil had existed at several locations along this coast since the 1850s). The extrapolation suggested that the region supported 72,000 (95% CI 31,000, 165,000) Dugongs in the early 1960s compared with an estimated 4,220 (95% CI 2,360, 8,360) Dugongs in the mid 1990s. The seagrass habitat in the region is currently insufficient to support 72,000 Dugongs, a result which suggests that the habitat had also declined or that the shark net CPUE has overestimated the decline (see Marsh <em>et al.</em> 2005). If the magnitude of this decline was robust and typical of the entire range of the Dugong, the Dugong would qualify for being classified as Critically Endangered at a global scale. However, there are sites in Australia that support large populations of Dugongs (e.g. Shark Bay, Torres Strait) where it is unlikely that such a decline has occurred (Marsh <em>et al.&#160;</em>2011, unpublished). <br/><br/>The major causes of the Dugong’s decline along the urban coast of Queensland are still present in most of the Dugong’s range as follows: gill netting, subsistence hunting, habitat loss from extreme weather events that are likely to be exacerbated by climate change, human settlement and agricultural pollution. The magnitude of these threats is likely to be greater in most other parts of the Dugong’s range than in Queensland. The Queensland coast supports a low human population density relative to most other parts of the Dugong’s range and has a well- developed system of marine parks and pro-active management. Nonetheless there is evidence of ongoing decline in Dugong numbers (Sobtzick <em>et al</em>. 2012) along the urban coast of the Great Barrier Reef Region largely attributed to habitat loss associated with extreme weather events. <br/><br/>Marsh <em>et al. </em>(2011) undertook a regional assessment of the Dugong and concluded that the East African population was likely ‘Endangered’; Red Sea and Gulf of Aden ‘Data Deficient’; Arabians Gulf ‘Data Deficient’; Indian sub-continent and Andaman and Nicobar Islands ‘Endangered’; continental South East Asia ‘Endangered’; archipelagic East and South East Asia ‘Data Deficient’; Western Pacific Islands ‘Data Deficient’; and Palau and the Japan (Ryukyus) as Critically Endangered. The most recent assessment of the Australian population (Woinarski <em>et al.&#160;</em>2014) concluded it was ‘Near Threatened’. The Dugong’s confirmed range states include a mix of developing and developed countries and territories including countries and territories with a very high Human Development Index (HDI), countries with a high HDI, countries with a medium HDI and three countries with a low HDI (Marsh <em>et al.</em> 2011). The outlook for Dugongs in countries with a very small Dugong population and/or a low HDI must be poor. These countries include Brunei, Cambodia, China, Comoros, Djibouti, Egypt, Iran, Japan, Kenya, Madagascar, Mayotte, Mozambique, Myanmar, Papua New Guinea, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Tanzania, Viet Nam and Yemen. Nonetheless, four countries/territories with a very high HDI (Australia, New Caledonia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates) support substantial populations of Dugongs (hundreds or thousands; Marsh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011), although even among and within these countries/territories the prospects are uneven. Because of the uncertainty associated with the assessment of the status of the Dugong, we suggest that the classification should remain as Vulnerable.","Habitat requirements for Dugongs include coastal areas, shallow to medium deep, warm waters (15-17°C minimum with behavioural thermoregulation), seagrass beds supporting sub-tropical and tropical species of seagrass, particularly low fiber species (Hines <em>et al.</em>&#160;2012, Marsh <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011). Dugongs show great variability in movement patterns and migration, depending on the study area and the influence of seasonal temperature or rainfall on regional ecosystems. Long-distance movements by Dugongs along the Queensland coast are well-documented (Sheppard <em>et al.</em> 2006), even though Dugongs do not appear to undertake regular migrations and individual movements are individualistic (Sheppard <em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, Marsh <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Gredzens <em>et al. </em>2014). Cope <em>et al. </em>(2015) used pedigree analysis based on individual genetic markers to infer the movements of Dugongs between locations in southeast Queensland including Moreton Bay and Hervey Bay. They found that approximately 30% of assigned parents had at least one offspring found in a different locality, implying recent movement of the parent or offspring. This analysis suggested markedly more movement between localities than detected through repeated direct sampling of individuals (Seddon <em>et al.</em> 2014) or through telemetry (Sheppard <em>et al.&#160;</em>2006).","Threats to Dugongs vary between different populations as detailed in Marsh <em>et al.</em> (2011) and Hines <em>et al.</em> (2012).&#160;Major threats include:<ul><li>Incidental capture in fishing gear (e.g. gill nets), shark nets for bather protection, IUU fishing especially if meat is subsequently sold (see Pilcher <em>et al. </em>2014, for a detailed rapid assessment based on questionnaires to provide information on conservation hotpots for Dugongs in 18 countries in four geographic areas: Pacific, Southeast Asia, South Asia and East Africa, with 6,153 respondents)</li><li>Hunting: legal (i.e. culturally sanctioned) and illegal</li><li>Boat strikes and boating activities (e.g. acoustic pollution)</li><li>Damage/modification/loss of habitat caused by human settlement on coasts, shipping, trawling destructive fishing, natural processes (e.g. cyclones and tsunamis)</li><li>Threats to seagrass (including untreated sewage disposal, coastal dredging and reclamation, inshore commercial trawling, agricultural pollution)</li><li>Chemical pollution (e.g. oil spills and heavy metal loads)</li><li>Climate change (extreme weather events and high temperatures)</li></ul>The major drivers for incidental capture in fishing gear and illegal hunting are poverty and declining fish stocks. Dugongs are legally protected in most of their range. However, enforcement is typically weak or non-existent. The imperative of artisanal fishers to break the law is increased by the opportunity to sell both Dugong meat (Robards and Reeves 2011) and valuable commodities such as swim bladders and shark fins (Marsh <em>et al. </em>2011). Artisanal coastal and riverine fisheries are vital to the livelihoods and food security of coastal peoples, especially in the tropics (Batista <em>et al. </em>2014), including most Dugong range states. On a global scale, such fisheries catch the same amount of fish for human consumption as commercial fisheries, yet employ some 25 times the number of fishers (over 12 million people; Chuenpagdee <em>et al.</em> 2008, Batista <em>et al.</em> 2014). Gill nets are significant threat to many marine mammals including dugongs (Read <em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, Moore <em>et al.</em> 2010, Pilcher <em>et al.</em> 2014). Some Dugong declines coincide with the introduction of monofilament nylon gill nets (Muir and Kizka 2012). However, it is often very difficult to convince the fishers or the fisheries managers to take the capture of Dugongs seriously. When Dugong population sizes are low, their capture in fisheries is a rare event, which becomes rarer as the Dugong population declines. Coastal development represents another important driver. Significant seagrass loss leads to Dugongs having reduced food resources, delayed reproduction and starvation (Marsh&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011). The impact of chemical and noise pollution on Dugongs is unquantified. (Marsh&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011).<br/><br/>Climate change is projected to lead to altered coastal environmental condition and increases in severe tropical storms and flood events that could affect both Dugongs and their seagrass habitats exacerbating the effects of the other drivers listed above (see Marsh <em>et al.</em> 2011 for details).","Five countries/territories (Australia, Bahrain, Papua New Guinea, Qatar and the United Arabian Emirates) support substantial subpopulations of Dugongs (thousands) with tens of thousands of Dugongs in northern Australia/Papua New Guinea alone (Marsh <em>et al.&#160;</em>2011, unpublished). The percentage of mature individuals is likely to vary between various subpopulations, but is likely to be somewhere between 45% and 70% (Marsh <em>et al.</em> 2011). Genetic information on Dugong stocks is mostly limited to the Australian region. Recent work based on mitochondrial DNA (Blair <em>et al.</em> 2014) shows that the Australian Dugong population is not panmictic. The Australian population still has high genetic diversity, indicating that recent population declines are not yet reflected in the genetic makeup of the population. Seddon <em>et al. </em>(2014) used microsatellite markers to demonstrate low, but significant, population differentiation within a regional in southern Queensland. Further data (D. Blair unpublished data) using the same genetic markers indicate considerable differentiation between southern and northern Queensland populations. Preliminary population-genetic and phylogeographic studies on Dugongs outside Australia are ongoing. These studies suggest strong regional differentiation. Australian populations are largely distinct from those elsewhere; populations in the Western Indian Ocean (Red Sea, Persian/Arabian Gulf, East Africa) are rather uniform and with limited genetic diversity; Madagascar might harbour a distinct lineage. The situation for the Indo-Malay Region is unclear but possibly more than one historical lineage occurs there. Thailand (Palmer 2004, L. Parr unpublished data) and Australia (McDonald 2005, Blair <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014) are home to distinct matrilines that possibly diverged during Pleistocene sea-level fluctuations, but are now able to mix geographically within those regions",Decreasing,"Dugongs inhabit coastal and island waters between East Africa and Vanuatu between latitudes of about 27° north and south of Equator. Spanning approximately 128,000 km of coastline (860,000 km<sup>2</sup>) across at least 37 and and possibly occur in an additional seven states and territories (Marsh <em>et al.&#160;</em>2011, N. Pilcher pers. comm).<p><span lang=""EN-US""></p>","Archaeological evidence confirms exploitation of Dugongs by early humans. As long as 6,000 years ago, Dugongs on the small island of Akab in the United Arabian Emirates were hunted for food (Méry <em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). Excavations in the Torres Strait, Australia, has revealed that Dugong hunting in this region dates back at least 4,000 years and possibly up to 7,000 years (Crouch <em>et al.</em>&#160;2007, Wright 2010) and that the harvest has been substantial for at least 400–500 years (McNiven and Bedingfield 2008).&#160;Although hunting is now legally banned in most countries, there are important exceptions for the subsistence use by traditional peoples. In Australia, the Dugong hunting rights of ‘Native Title Holders’ (indigenous people who can prove continuous connections to their traditional land and sea country) have been consistently upheld by the courts in a series of landmark decisions since 1993. Dugong hunting still has considerable cultural significance to coastal Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples across northern Australia, and Dugong meat is considered by these groups to be the one of the highest value traditional foods. Some subsistence Dugong hunting is also allowed in the Pacific states of Papua New Guinea (restrictions apply), Vanuatu and New Caledonia (restrictions apply), where Dugongs are still of great cultural and dietary significance.Commercial exploitation of Dugongs occurred intermittently at various places along the coast of Queensland, Australia, from 1847-1969 (Daley <em>et al</em>. 2008).&#160;Numerous products are still obtained from Dugongs and used for food, folk medicine, cooking/lubrication, aphrodisiacs, amulets/charms/jewellery, carvings, religious artefacts, leather products and other (Marsh <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011). Trade in Dugong (and all other sirenian) products is regulated or banned by the Convention for Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). Dugongs are currently listed on CITES Appendix I.",Marine,"Dugongs are covered under three international conservation conventions: The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and the Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals (also known as CMS or the Bonn Convention). Dugongs are also included in the Coral Triangle Initiative (CTI), goal five (Threatened Species). Additionally, the Convention on Wetlands (the Ramsar Convention) protects some important Dugong habitats.<br/><br/>To date, there has been little effective management intervention to reduce anthropogenic impacts on the Dugong, apart from legislative protection which is almost ubiquitous throughout its range. Protected area initiatives aim to protect Dugongs in many range states (Marsh <em>et al. </em>2011) and are most developed in Australia. Most of the marine protected areas outside Australia with the potential to protect Dugongs are ‘paper parks’ where laws and regulations exist but are not implemented. Strategic Action Programmes/Strategic Plans/Action Plans to protect Dugongs have been developed by countries in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden region (Gerges 2002), Indonesia (de Iongh <em>et al.</em> 2009a, 2009b) and South Pacific Regional Environmental Programme (SPREP; Gillespies 2005). However, effective enforcement of conservation regulations is a problem throughout most of the region because of poverty, lack of resources and personnel. The most pressing need is for alternative sustainable livelihoods that address poverty and provide incentives for conservation. The most promising initiative is the UNEP Dugong, Seagrass &amp; Coastal Communities Initiative (see <a href=""http://www.cms.int/en/publication/dugong-seagrass-and-coastal-communities-initiative"">http://www.cms.int/en/publication/dugong-seagrass-and-coastal-communities-initiative</a>).",Afrotropical|Australasian|Indomalayan|Oceanian|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Pallas’s Cats are generally found at low densities, though in small rich patches in Russia they have been found at much higher density (Kirilyuk and Barashkova 2011). Their low density is believed to be a result of interspecific predation and the resulting habitat specialisation leading to a small percentage of the landscape being suitable for their needs. Due to their general low density and patchy distribution, relatively large areas are required to conserve viable populations (Ross et al. 2019a). Pallas’s Cats are also highly dependent on cavities to provide dens for daily use and rearing young, which further restricts habitat availability (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2010a).</p><p>Predation by sympatric carnivores, herding dogs, and human offtake are the main known causes of mortality, but habitat disturbance and fragmentation is believed to be their main threat (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019b). Mineral exploitation and infrastructure developments have increased throughout the species range. Pallas’s Cat also continues to be at risk from a declining prey base due to pika (<em>Ochotona</em> spp.) and rodent control programmes leading to prey depletion and secondary poisoning (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019b).</p><p>Due to the difficulty of observing the species, data generally consist of individual records, and there are no current monitoring programmes that would allow empirical estimates of population size or population trend. However, recent reviews have highlighted that the global population size is unlikely to be low enough to qualify as Near Threatened (Barashkova<em> et al. </em>2019). In addition, we used the methods of Santini <em>et al. </em>(2019) to quantify habitat loss and disturbance across Pallas’s Cats range between 1994 and 2015 (or three generations). The analyses indicated that between these years the change in suitable habitat and level of habitat fragmentation was low, suggesting suitable habitat is likely to be disappearing at a lower rate than previously assumed, and indicating the population may be more stable than thought. Though caution is needed as information on the Pallas’s Cat is incomplete, and threats may be acting at a different scale than our analyses. We also have no information describing the species population dynamics and how the population may track prey availability. Nevertheless, based on distributional data, the Pallas’s Cat population as a whole appears more stable than previously thought leading to its inclusion in the Least Concern category.</p><p>  </p><p>  </p><p>  </p>","<p></p><p>Pallas's Cat is distributed in landscapes with extreme continental climates - little rainfall, low humidity, and a wide range of temperatures. They are rarely found in areas where there is persistent snow cover of depths over 10 cm, and a continuous snow cover of 15–20 cm is thought to mark the ecological limit for this species (Heptner and Sludskii 1972, Kirilyuk and Puzanski 2000, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). They are generally associated with montane grassland steppe and shrub steppe, but are habitat specialists, selecting habitats providing hiding cover such as ravines, rocky areas, and disruptive vegetation cover that allow them to move through the landscape without being detected by predators (Ross 2009, Ross <em>et al. </em>2012). Their optimal habitat consists of a mix of grassland and shrub steppe with rocky cover, ravines, and hill-slopes. They are rarely found in lowland basins or flat featureless plains, although may access these areas through ravines or other disruptive cover, to access prey or in transit to better habitat (Ross 2009, Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2019, Ross <em>et al. </em>2019b).</p><p>A recent review discussed the general habitat features of Pallas’s Cats’ in Central Asia (Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019), Western Asia (Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019), and the Himalaya and China (Dhendup <em>et al. </em>2019). Central Asian habitats were characterised by hills, rocky outcrops, scree slopes, ravines, and rock cover, with petrophytic dry steppe or semi-desert vegetation (Heptner and Sludskii 1972; Sludskii 1982; Kirilyuk and Puzansky 2000; Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010a, b, 2012; Istomov <em>et al.</em> 2016; Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2019).</p><p>In Western Asia, a single record in the Iranian Caucasus suggests Pallas’s Cat uses open, hilly steppes and shrubland, with rocky outcrops and scattered trees (Aghili<em> et al. </em>2008). In Iran, the Pallas’s Cat occurs across a wide continuum of habitats, from arid grass­land steppes and dry mountains to temperate open shrublands. In Afghanistan, habitat consists of arid plateaus with flat and rolling mountains interspersed by rocky and deep valleys. In Pakistan, the species prefers alpine and sub­alpine scrub, dominated by rugged and broken terrain with high cliffs, ridges and ravines. In Turkmenistan, the species is predominantly associated with mountains and foothills (Heptner and Sludskii 1972, Rustamov and Hojamyradov 1994, Chalani <em>et al.</em> 2008, Joolaee<em> et al. </em>2014, Farhadinia et al. 2016, Talebi Otaghvar<em> et al. </em>2017, Adibi<em> et al. </em>2018, Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019). In Turkmenistan, the species is historically considered rare (Shukurov 1962) and predominantly associated with mountains and foothills of the Kopet Dag and the Big Balkan range (A. Potaeva and T. Rosen, pers. comm. 2019, Shukurov 1962). Pallas’s Cat has also been found in juniper woodland (<em>Juniperus </em>spp.) in Pakistan and Iran (Hameed <em>et al.</em> 2014, Dibadj <em>et al.</em> 2018). In Western Asia, the median elevation of Pallas’s Cat records is 2,372 m (range: 894–3,665 m), which corresponds to a mid-mountain elevation (Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019).</p><p>There are fewer records or accounts of Pallas’s Cat habitat in the Himalaya and China region, meaning we are unable to assess the importance of different habitat types. However, habitats of the region are generally of higher elevation with some of the highest elevation records found for the species (Fox and Dorji 2007, Chanchani 2008, Werhahn <em>et al. </em>2018, Dhendup <em>et al.</em> 2019, Pal <em>et al.</em> 2019). In Bhutan, with its warmer south-facing Himalayan slopes, Pallas’s Cat is found in rolling hills dominated by glacial out-wash and alpine steppe vegetation (<a name=""_Hlk10972711"">WWF 2012</a>, Thinley 2013). Pallas’s Cat occurs in Nepal in upper Manang valley within broken and rocky habitats, rolling hill slopes with few cliffs, and in Dolpo in rocky hill slopes within montane grassland steppe (Shrestha <em>et al.</em> 2014, Lama <em>et al.</em> 2016, Regmi <em>et al.</em> 2016). In India, the majority of records are from the Trans-Himalayan landscapes of Ladakh and Sikkim (Prater and Barruel 1971, Mallon 1991, Mahar <em>et al.</em> 2017, Pal <em>et al.</em> 2019). In the Tibetan region Pallas’s Cat has been reported in desert steppe habitat at 5,050 m dominated by <em>Stipa</em> spp. (Fox and Dorji 2007) and in mountainous alpine meadows in Qinghai (Li <em>et al. </em>2013) and Mountain steppe in Sichuan (Webb<em> et al.</em> 2014, 2016).</p><p>The observed large-scale habitat associations of Pallas’s Cat, which all contain some form of disruptive or hiding cover, can be explained by Pallas’s Cat being under constant risk of predation by sympatric aerial and terrestrial carnivores (Ross 2009). We have evidence of predation by numerous large raptors, and carnivores such as the grey wolf (<em>Canis lupus</em>), herding dogs, and red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), they are also hunted by humans (Ross 2009, Barashkova and Smelansky 2011; Ross <em>et al.</em> 2012, 2019b), other large carnivores, such as snow leopard, may also opportunistically predate Pallas’s Cat where they co-exist. The Pallas’s Cat is not a fast runner and when threatened by other predators its best line of defence is hiding out of sight, relying on their excellent camouflage and taking cover in burrows (of marmots or sympatric carnivores) or in rock crevices. In general, open areas without suitable cover are avoided and habitats with disruptive cover such as ravines, rocky areas, shrub-steppe, and hill-slopes are highly selected (Ross 2009, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010a). As a result, Pallas’s Cat uses only a small fraction of habitats available within the steppe ecosystem. Their habitat selection and specialisation is the most likely explanation for their low densities (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2016, 2019a), and should be accounted for in expert knowledge-based estimates of their potential population size.</p><p>Pallas’s Cat also has a dependency on refuges or dens. Dens are used on a daily basis to provide important cover from predators, for feeding, mating, giving birth, raising young, and for thermoregulation during the extremely cold winters (Ross <em>et al</em>. 2010a). Den availability is thought to be critical for survival, and a critical habitat requirement for their conservation (Ross 2009, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010a). Dens mostly consist of marmot burrows and rock crevices (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010a), in Southern Siberia and Kazakhstan the den sites of sympatric carnivores are more commonly used (Ross<em> et al</em>. 2019b), and in Iran Pallas’s Cat has been observed using aged Juniperus excelsa tree cavities as breeding dens (Dibadj <em>et al. </em>2018). Despite the range of habitats used by the species, the presence of suitable cavities appears to be a standard niche requirement (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019a).</p><p>The annual home ranges of Pallas’s Cat are unusually large for a small felid. Researchers in Mongolia</p><p>have measured mean annual home ranges as follows (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2012):</p><p>Female = 95% kernels 23.1 +/- 8.9 km²; 100% MCP = 64.1+/-18.6 km²; n = 13</p><p>Male = 95% kernels 98.8 +/- 17.2 km², 100% MCP = 159.0 +/- 59.3 km²; n = 9</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Radio-tracking studies of Pallas’s Cat in the Daursky State Nature Reserve (Zabaikalsky Krai, Russia)</p><p>calculated the following ranges (Barashkova and Kirilyuk 2011):</p><p>Female = 95% kernels 6.0 +/- 3.4 km²; 100% MCP = 10.0 +/- 6.5 km²; n = 4 </p><p>Male = 95% kernels 22.9 +/- 12.9 km²; 100% MCPs = 16.5 +/- 9.4 km²; n = 3</p><p>Pallas’s Cat diet is mainly composed of small lagomorphs and rodents, it is known to be a pika (Ochotona spp.) specialist (Ross et al. 2010b). Pikas are the most important prey across its range, typically comprising over 50% of the diet and highly selected over other prey species (Heptner and Sludskii 1972, Ross et al. 2010b). As pikas are 2–4 times larger than other common small mammal prey, Pallas’s Cat preference for them optimises hunting efficiency and energy intake. They also consume gerbils, jirds, voles, hamsters and ground squirrels; less frequently consumed prey includes small birds, young marmots, hares, hedgehogs, reptiles, and invertebrates (Kirilyuk 1999, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010b, Adibi <em>et al.</em> 2018, Werhahn <em>et al. </em>2018, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019, Moqanaki<em> et al.</em> 2019). Pallas’s Cats has also been recorded eating berries (Kirilyuk 1999) and scavenging from carcasses (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010b, 2019b).</p><p>                                                In an assessment of Pallas’s Cat habitat loss and fragmentation at a global scale, E.M. <span class=""A8"">Moqanaki, (unpublished analyses) used the methods of Santini <em>et al.</em> (2019) to quantify habitat loss and disturbance across Pallas’s Cats range (AOO) between 1994 and 2015 (or three generations). The analyses indicated that between these years the change in extent of suitable habitat within EOO (represented by ESA (2015)’s CCI land cover categories 120, 121, 122, 130, 140, 150, 200, 201, 202) and level of habitat fragmentation was very low (below 5%). As previous assessments have used estimates of habitat loss as justification to infer a declining Pallas’s Cat population, the analyses suggests the population is likely to be more stable than previously thought. A more detailed analyses, of habitat loss across the species range, that includes more variables and simulation, is recommended to provide a better indicator of Pallas’s Cat and other steppe species likely status.</p><span class=""A8""><p></p></span>","<p>Pallas’s Cat has several known and tested biological causes of vulnerability, including feeding and habitat specialisation, large home range sizes, making them difficult to protect within reserves, and a dependency on shelters made by other threatened species, such as Siberian marmots Marmota sibirica (Ross 2009, 2010 a,b, 2012).</p>  <p>In most regions, the specialist requirements of the Pallas’s Cat result in its distribution being naturally fragmented, due to resources and habitat patches being se­parated by large areas of poor habitat with insufficient prey or cover from predation (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2016, 2019b). As Pallas’s Cat is predated by sympatric carnivores it has a need for safe refuges, and so has a dependency on marmot burrows and rock cavities, particularly for raising young (Ross <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2010a). Most marmot species remain non-threatened but the Siberian Marmot, which overlaps Pallas’s Cat’s range in Russia and Mongolia, has declined due to overharvesting and is now classified as Endangered (Clayton 2016). The decline in marmots may result in the loss burrow habitat which is regarded as a keystone resource for Pallas’s Cat in many regions of grassland steppe across its range (Ross <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2010a).</p>  <p>The most serious threat to Pallas’s Cat across its range is habitat degradation and frag­mentation that are largely consequences of increasing livestock numbers, conversion of steppe grasslands into arable land, infrastruc­ture development and resource extraction. Mineral exploitation and infrastructural developments have also increased substantially across the range with increased frag­mentation as a result (Awehali 2011, Paltsyn <em>et al. </em>2012, Selles 2013; Ross <em>et al. </em>2016, 2019a). Due to degradation and loss of habitat, Pallas’s Cat populations are becoming increasingly fragmented, and isolated subpopulations are very likely disappearing without our knowledge (<a name=""_Hlk10872039"">Ross <em>et al. </em>2019</a>a). In Mongolia, for example, livestock numbers have increased from 26 million in 1991 to 66 million in 2018 (FAO 1998, National Statistical Office of Mongolia 2018). Increasing livestock numbers result in heavy grazing and habitat degradation, but also in displacement of Pallas’s Cats and increasing number of herding dogs which are known to kill the species (Ross 2009, Barashkova and Smelansky 2011, Ross <em>et al. </em>2012, Joolaee <em>et al.</em> 2014, Farhadinia <em>et al.</em> 2016, Ruta 2018). In Kazakhstan there is also a threat from farming, as large areas of secondary steppe grassland are being converted into arable pastures endangering local Pallas’s Cat subpopulations by increasing isolation and fragmentation of habitat (<a>A. Barashkova pers. comm. 2019).</a></p>  <p>Predation by herding dogs, feral dogs, acci­dental capture when trapping or snaring other animals, and illegal and legal hunting are the main recorded causes of direct anthropogenic mortality of Pallas’s Cats (Ross 2009, Barashkova and Smelansky 2011, Farhadinia <em>et al</em><em>.&#160;</em>2016, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2016, Ruta 2018, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019).</p>  <p>New emerging threats are also of con­cern. Climate change for example is predicted to have large impacts on the grasslands and mountain ecosystems of Central Asia and the Himalayas (Angerer <em>et al. </em>2008, Xu <em>et al. </em>2009). The potential impacts of climate change on Pallas’s Cats are unknown, but evidence sug­gests recent changes of the grassland and mountain ecosystems of Central Asia and Himalayas are at least in part related to cli­mate change (Angerer <em>et al.</em> 2008, Xu<em> et al.</em> 2009). Climate change is also predicted to have large impacts on steppe and mountain ecosystems in the future with a cascade of changes to the ecosystem likely to follow (IPCC 2014). As Pallas’s Cat is a strict seasonal breeder, female ovulation and male sperm production are both regulated by day length and peak during the late winter breeding season (Brown <em>et al. </em>2002). Con­sidering that the breeding season is dictated by day length, as opposed to climate, Pallas’s Cats may be unable to respond to seasonal changes in ecological parameters that result from climate change. As indicated by large gains in body mass, Pallas’s Cats build-up en­ergy reserves during the summer when prey is abundant (Ross 2009, Naidenko<em> et al. </em>2014), and invest these reserves in reproduction during the late winter when prey availability is low (Ross <em>et al. </em>2010a). As climate change alters seasonal patterns, and with it prey availability, this is likely to affect Pallas’s Cats’ ability to balance energy reserves (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019a).</p>  The poisoning of small mammals, such as pikas and Brandt’s vole Lasiopodomys brandtii, is still occurring in the steppe ecosystem, with an aim of reducing disease transmission from small mammals to humans and livestock and improving range­land quality for livestock (Smith <em>et al. </em>2008). Although information is scarce, poisoning continues in China where pika populations can be reduced by 95% (Lai and Smith 2003, Ba­dingqiuying <em>et al. </em>2016). In the Qinghai-Tibe­tan Plateau, for example, between 2006 and 2013 approximately $25.5 million was spent to eradicate the plateau pika (<em>O. curzoniae</em>) from over 78,500 km2 in Sanjiangyuan National Nature Reserve alone (Wilson and Smith 2015). Research has also shown carnivore populations may suffer declines as a consequence of poisoning campaigns (Badingqiuying <em>et al.</em> 2016). In Mongolia, campaigns to control small mammal numbers have occurred in all provinces (Clark <em>et al.</em> 2006, Winters 2006, Ross <em>et al. </em>2016) but there is no informa­tion on its current prevalence. In Russia and Kazakhstan poisoning occurs at a local scale to control local disease outbreaks (Barashkova et al. 2019). Although the occurrence of poisoning has very likely decreased over the last decade, where the practice continues there is little doubt that aerial and terrestrial carnivores will suffer multiple consequences, such as secondary poisoning and prey depletion (Ross <em>et al. </em>2019a).<p></p>","<p>As Pallas’s Cat has a wide yet fragmented distribution across the grasslands and montane steppes of Central and Western Asia, we assume the global population is fragmented into many sub-populations. Due to the difficulty of reliably and repeatedly detecting Pallas’s Cat by any survey protocol, the differentiation of sub-populations and the estimate of population size remains extremely difficult. Nevertheless, several estimates of population density have been made, using several methods. In central Mongolia, an estimate of 4–8 cats/100 km² was made based upon radio telemetry of 28 cats, weekly spotlight surveys, and observations while radiotracking over a period of 2 years, giving confidence that most individuals were observed (Ross 2009). Several population estimates have been made in Russia, based on snow tracking and correction formulas. Snow tracking studies in Russia have suggested that the Pallas’s Cat can periodically occur at very high densities up to 100 cats/100 km² in areas of Dauria (Kirilyuk and Barashkova 2011, Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2017). Confirming the high densities, Naidenko <em>et al.</em> (2014) captured a total of 16 Pallas’s Cats in an area of 16 km², equating to an apparent density of 100 cats/100 km² in Dauria. Though the high density is very likely to be a localised phenomenon, possibly related to prey eruptions. However, given the lack of repeated occurrences of the Pallas’s Cat in many areas across its range, it seems low density (4 cats/100 km²&#160;) is a more applicable average density for the species.&#160;&#160;</p>  In a recent review of Pallas’s Cat in Russia and Central Asia, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> (2019) estimated the potential population size in this region as approximately 49,000–98,000. Though they added the estimate is highly speculative. The estimate also assumed the entire predicted suitable habitat is currently occupied. Based on our understanding of the AOO (based on predictive models of Pallas's Cat occupancy), we estimate the global population of mature Pallas's Cats at approximately 58,000. This is based on the assumption that within the AOO Pallas's Cat has an average density of 4 cats/100 km², and that 20% of the population are immature non-breeders.&#160; Despite the speculative nature of these estimates, they indicate that the population size of Pallas’s Cat almost certainly exceeds the limits specified under the Near Threatened classification.<p></p>",Decreasing,"<p>  </p><p>The Pallas’s Cat primarily occurs within regions of montane grassland and shrubland steppe of Central Asia, but is found as far west as Western Iran and previously extended into Armenia and Azerbaijan (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2016). The core populations of Pallas’s Cat are believed to occur in Mongolia and China (Smith <em>et al.</em>&#160;2008, Jutzeler et al. 2010). In Russia, the Pallas’s Cat occurs along the border with Mongolia and China mainly in the Altai, Tyva, and Buryatia Republics (Altai and Sayan Mountains), and Trans-Baikal Territory (Koshkarev 1998, Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2007). They are found in mountain steppe and semi desert foothills in Central and eastern Kazakhstan (Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019), and some areas of Kyrgyzstan (Snow Leopard Trust 2014, Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2019). In Uzbekistan and Tajikistan the species was recorded before the 1960s but not more recently (Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2019).</p><p>Outside Iran, records of Pallas’s Cat in the southwest of its range (also vaguely known as the Caspian Sea range; Southern Caucuses, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan) are rare and thus the conservation status of the species there is unknown (Habibi 2004, Hameed<em> </em><em>et al.</em> 2014<a name=""_Hlk12187509"">, Farhadinia <em>et al. </em>2016</a>, Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019). Iran appears to have the widest geographic distribution of the Pallas’s Cat in this region, where most of the recent occurrence records are associated with the two main mountain chains of Alborz and Zagros in the north and west, respectively (Karami <em>et al.</em> 2016, Moqanaki <em>et al. </em>2019, Yusefi <em>et al.</em> 2019). In Afghanistan, multiple occurrences have been recently collected from Bamyan Province during camera trap surveys for the Persian leopard (<em>Panthera pardus</em>; WCS 2017). Recent occurrence records from Pakistan are restricted to Gilgit-Baltistan, and there is evidence they inhabit the border area with Afghanistan (<a name=""_Hlk12187460"">Hameed <em>et al.</em> 2014, </a>Hussain 2018). The latest Pallas’s Cat records from Turkmenistan are from Dushak Erekdag in the Kopet Dag, the Turkmen-Khorasan Mountain Range in the borderland with north-eastern Iran (A. Potaeva and T. Rosen, pers. comm. 2019). The species presence in Pakistan’s Baluchistan Province, as well as Armenia and Azerbaijan in the Caucasus, is uncertain (Moqanaki<em> et al</em>. 2019).</p><p>        Recent records from Bhutan, Nepal, and India also suggest Pallas’s Cat presence in the Eastern Himalayan region but at a low density (WWF 2012, Thinley 2013, Shrestha <em>et al.</em> 2014, Mahar<em> et al</em>. 2017, Dhendup <em>et al</em>. 2019, <a name=""_Hlk12187607"">Pal <em>et al</em>. 2019</a>). The highest elevation record for Pallas’s Cat, of 5,593 m, was found in the Himalayan region in Nepal (Werhahn <em>et al</em>. 2018).</p><p>  </p>","<p>The extent of illegal hunting and illegal trade of Pallas’s Cats or their body parts is unknown (Barclay <em>et al.</em> 2019, Ross <em>et al. </em>2019a). It has been reported that international trade in Pallas’s Cat pelts ceased since the late 1980s, and Mongolia is the only range country where hunting of Pallas’s Cat is per­mitted today, although they can be hunted in China if a special license is obtained (Lu <em>et al. </em>2010, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2016, Barclay <em>et al.</em> 2019). The permitting system in Mongolia is said to be ineffective and Pallas’s Cat furs were exported illegally to China (Murdoch <em>et al. </em>2006). It has been estimated that there were about 1,000 legal Pallas’s Cat hunters in Mongolia with a mean harvest rate of 2 Pallas’s Cats per hunter per year (Wingard and Zahler 2006). It is difficult to estimate levels of illegal hunting, though it is likely much higher than the legal level of hunting and is known to happen across all range countries. Evidence of illegal trade in Pallas’s Cat is reported from Afghanistan and Pakistan (e.g. Kretser <em>et al. </em>2012), but it seems to be only occasional and opportunistic, though this may reflect the rarity of Pallas’s Cat. Marmots are commonly hunted in most of the Pallas’s Cats range and Pallas’s Cats are often mistaken for marmots and shot (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2019b). They are also trapped incidentally in leg-hold traps and snares set for other animals (Ross 2009). The fat and organs of Pallas’s Cats are used as medicine in Mongolia and Russia (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2016, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019). A report from Kyrgyzstan suggests that Pallas’s Cat is often harvested in winter by tracking them back to their den and capturing them using snares (T. Rosen pers. comm. 2020). Undoubtably more information on illegal offtake of Pallas’s Cat is needed, as hunting could be a more significant threat than we currently assume, certainly at a local level but possibly also range wide.</p>",Terrestrial,"<p><span class=""A9"">In 2019 a conservation action plan was written to move towards promoting the survival of Pallas’s Cat across its historic range. The action plan has a number of conservation actions including increasing conservation research, education and awareness, decreasing human caused mortality and coordinating conservation efforts. These actions will be implemented over the next 10 years (<span class=""A15"">Pallas's Cat Global Action Planning Group 2019), and consequently, conservation action is expected to increase in the near future.</span></p>  <p>In situ conservation of the species occurs mainly through prohibi­tion or regulation of hunting and trade, and habitat conservation within protected areas (Barashkova et al. 2019; Pallas’s Cat is listed under CITES Appendix II as <em>Felis manul</em>). Hunting of this species is prohibited in most current range countries except Mongolia (Nowell and Jackson 1996), which restricts hunting and regulates trade through a permitting system. Trophy hunters can purchase limited hunting licenses in Mongolia and export trophies (Clark <em>et al</em><em>. </em>2006).</p>  <p>Using predictive modelling across Central Asia, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> (2019) estimated that suitable Pallas’s Cat habitats cover 170 protected areas of Russia, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan; although confirmation of the species has only been documented in 36 of the protected areas. In Russia, the Tyvan and Daurian State Nature Reserves remain the most important protected areas for Pallas’s Cat conservation, the recently created federal refuge in Dzeren's Valley (subordinated to Daursky reserve) is also occupied by Pallas’s Cat's ( Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019). Although research is ongoing in Western Asia and the Himalaya, conservation actions are currently limited (<span class=""A8"">Moqanaki<em> et al. </em>2019, Dhendup <em>et al</em>. 2019). A preliminary assessment of the potential distribution of the Pallas’s Cat in Western Asia predicted vast climatic suitability across mid-elevation areas in this region, yet dispersal barriers and biotic interactions (e.g. predator-prey relationships) may have restricted the currently occupied habitat (Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019). The same is true of China, but Pallas’s Cat has been reported in several protected areas including: Xuelingyunshan, Tuomuerfeng, Luoshan, Baijitan, Qinghaihuniaodao, Wanglang, Wolong, Zhumulangmafeng, Kalamailishan, Qitaihuangmobanhuangmo, Aerjinshan, Ganjiahu (Xinjiang), Luobupoyeluotuo (CSIS 2008). It is reportedly present in at least 29 Chinese Nature Reserves (Mallon 2002, Smith <em>et al.</em> 2008, Jutzeler <em>et al</em><em>. </em>2010, <span class=""A8"">Dhendup<em> et al. </em>2019).</span></p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Required Conservation Actions</p>  <p></p><ol><li>Implimentation of conservation action plan (Pallas's Cat Global Action Planning Group 2019).</li><li>Confirm occupancy in protected areas within the species EOO, and extend to confirm occupancy in suitable habitats predicted using distribution models. </li><li>Establish a suitable and quantifiable monitoring method for the species.</li><li>Identify and implement population monitoring in key areas that have potential to indicate the species status at a wider scale. </li><li>Identify regions where human caused threats endanger Pallas’s Cat and implement mitigation measures.&#160; </li><li>Recommend new protected areas in Pallas’s Cat hotspots not currently protected. </li><li>Increase collaboration between Pallas’s Cat researchers to validate and refine population distribution and habitat distribution models.&#160; </li><li>Understand the species population dynamics in relation to potential prey population cycles in areas where we know large population fluctuations occur (such as the Daurian steppe).

These factors, together with unavailability of reliable data on the abundance and distribution of this species, make it difficult to implement effective conservation actions for long-term conservation. Therefore, the Mainland serow qualifies as Vulnerable because of a decline exceeding 30% over three generations as inferred from local surveys, decline in occupied area and habitat quality as well as actual levels of exploitation. The species requires urgent conservation actions.<br/><br/><em>Capricornis sumatraensis sumatraensis </em></span>is assessed as Vulnerable (VU A2; C1) because this subspecies is believed to be in significant decline driven by both over-hunting and serious habitat loss.<span style=""""><em><br/><br/>Capricornis sumatraensis milneedwardsii</em></span> and <em>C. s. thar </em>were previously assessed as Near Threatened. New data and information suggest that these subspecies are experiencing significant declines in population size, range size and their habitat over the last decade, and continuing significant declines are expected to occur in future due to intensive human impact. Both of these subspecies are therefore assessed as Vulnerable (VU A2; C1).</p>","<p>The mainland serow is a forest dwelling mammal, and inhabits mountain slopes with rugged steep hills and rocky places from 100 m to 4,000 m (Li&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, Phan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, Paudel&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015, Buzzard&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018, McShea&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). It is also recorded in temperate coniferous forests and broadleaved forests in Nepal (Paudel&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015) and northwest Yunnan, Southwest China (Buzzard&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018) and in the dense thickets of Rhododendron and Vaccinium in Vietnam (Abramov&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006). It also inhabits lowland montane forests with gentler terrain, including flat areas with shrubs (Li&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012). The serow occurs also on small offshore islands, such as Cat Ba Island in north Vietnam (Phan <em>et al</em>. 2014) and coastal small islands along the Northern Peninsula in Thailand (S. Lovari pers. comm).<br/><br/>While the mainland serow are sensitive to human disturbance, they seem to tolerate moderately degraded forests and small isolated limestone hills and cliffs in both natural karst scrubland and even disturbed habitats (Lekagul and Mcneely 1988). Studies have found that serow occupancy is positively correlated with distance to roads, distance to villages and distance to trails indicating its preference for areas inaccessible to human encroachment (Li&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012, Phan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). The serow prefers closed canopy habitats to open ones, at relatively high altitudes in coniferous and rhododendron forests (Li&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, Buzzard&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). However, the species prefers open canopy to closed canopy, in low altitude limestone forests (Phan&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019).<br/><br/>This species normally winters in the forest belt, on flat and hilly slopes, while they move to higher-elevation cliffs and high slopes in the summer season (Wu and Zhang 2004, McShea&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). In addition, the separation of habitat selection of this species in winter and summer is based on vegetation type, tree dispersion, slope, elevation, rock dispersion, tree size, slope position, canopy and water sources. However, shelter, and concealment opportunities, as well as distance from water, were not found to be significantly influenced by season (Wu and Zhang 2004).<br/><br/>The species feeds on a wide range of leaves and twigs of at least 33 different plant species in the Cat Ba Island, Vietnam (Phan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012), and 34 plant species in the Annapurna Conservation Area, Nepal (Giri&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011). Most of these plant species are shrubs and low growing trees and thus serow is categorised as a typical browser.<br/><br/>The Mainland Serow is active at almost any time, especially at dawn (Li&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018b). They shelter under overhanging cliffs and rocks Lovari and Locati 1984). This species may naturally occur at rather low density, compared to other sympatric bovid species such as Goral and Takin (McShea&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). It is mostly solitary and probably territorial (McShea&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018), marking the boundaries of its territory e.g. with dung piles (Lovari and Locati 1994). Several individuals are sometimes seen in the same area, but they feed some distance apart (Lekagul and McNeely 1988). The breeding season occurs on late October and November, and a single kid is born after a seven-month gestation period and will stay with its mother for almost a year (Lekagul and Mcneely 1988).</p>","<p>Currently, the Mainland Serow is facing two main threats, i.e.  over-poaching and habitat loss. Over-poaching, especially using snares  to supply local and regional markets with meat, horns and other body  parts has caused a rapid decline of this species in Southeast Asia  (Steinmetz <em>et al.</em>&#160;2010; Shepherd and Krishnasamy 2014; Leupen&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). Forest encroachment and clearance in protected and  non-protected areas where this species exists are likely to have had a  significant impact. In addition, most of the plant species consumed by  the serows are medicinal herbs and edible sources for humans and thus  they have been massively exploited by local people (Giri&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011;  Phan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). These threats may determine a decrease in the  numbers of serows and an increase in the fragmentation of populations,  causing high risks of local extirpations over its range.<br/><br/>In  China, poaching, primarily through snares, is considered the top threat  to wild serow, especially in eastern China where a very dense human  population occurs. Die-offs caused by sarcoptic mange, typically during  late winter to early spring, when the animals are weak, have been widely  reported in western China, which may lead to abrupt decreases or even  elimination of local serow populations (McShea&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). In  addition, the meat, fur and other body parts of this species are highly  prized by local people for food and medicinal purposes, and thus the  species faces severe poaching pressure within its Chinese range  (Shackleton, 1997).<br/><br/>Serows are also significantly threatened by  widespread poaching, illegal trade and habitat loss in South-east Asia.  In Cambodia, logging, hunting, habitat loss and vast numbers of  landmines are the main threats to the species. Illegal commercial  hunting, particularly snaring, remains the major threat to the  ground-dwelling mammals in Cardamom Rainforest Landscape and is possibly  impacting populations of most such species in the landscape (Gray&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). The removal of more than 109,000 snares from the Southern  Cardamom National Park and Tatai Wildlife Sanctuary between 2010 and  2015 was hard evidence of the risks which serows may face (Wildlife  Alliance, unpublished data). In addition, local law enforcement is also  minimal (Gray&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). Cambodia has also experienced the most  rapid deforestation rate globally, between 2001 and 2014, and  approximately 1,150 km² of the protected areas in Cardamom Rainforest  Landscape have been lost to Economic Land Concessions for industrial  agriculture (Davis&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015), thereby reducing the mountainous  habitat for mammals, including the serow in the whole country (Gray&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). In Lao PDR, serow horns, skull bones, leg bones and other  body parts are used for traditional medicine and were recorded in 59  shops, and these items should be derived from a minimum of 150 serows  (Leupen&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). There is a cross-border trade in almost all parts  of the serow from Lao PDR to Thailand, Vietnam and China. However, the  effects of this entire disturbance are unknown in Lao PDR (Salter and&#160; Phanthavong, 1997; Duckworth&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1999). In Vietnam, the serow is  frequently hunted for bush meat and for commercial purposes. Vietnam is a  significant consumer of wildlife meat, including serow and thus wild  meat is sold in many local markets and serow bones are purchased to make  medicines (Shairp et al., 2016; Nijman and Shepherd, 2017). Over  23,000 snares were discovered and removed by forest rangers in Hue-Quang  Nam Saola Reserve in 2015 (Gray&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018). The result of this  hunting is a significant decline in the populations of this species in  almost all protected areas in Vietnam (Do Tuoc. pers. comm. 2011). In  Thailand, loss of habitat caused by logging and land clearing for  agriculture, and poaching for meat and medicinal purposes are the major  threats for this species (Lovari, 1997). In addition, poaching for the  trade in trophies (skins and horns), and the collection of non-timber  forest products also negatively impact on the species and damage its  habitat, which has resulted in the species being threatened in almost  all forested areas in Thailand (Lyam&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006). Furthermore, the  remaining habitat for wildlife in Thailand is highly fragmented  presently and mostly too small to support viable populations of wildlife  species (Lyam&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006). In Myanmar, too, the major threats to the  serow include hunting, poaching, habitat degradation, and loss from  deforestation. Wildlife items are widely used in the local pharmacopeia,  and serow items were recorded for sale in 25 medicine shops in Mon  State, south Myanmar (Nijman and Shepherd 2017). Habitat degradation  and deforestation are the main consequences of human activities such  as timber harvesting and agriculture, and fires in the country (Salter  and Shackleton 1997).<br/><br/>In Indonesia, habitat destruction  threatens the long-term survival of the Sumatran serow. The principal  causes of habitat destruction are slash-and-burn agriculture practices  by highlanders and shifting cultivators, as well as the indiscriminate  extraction of timber for export to the West. Serows are caught in snares  as well as shot, for local consumption of the meat, and for use of body  parts in traditional medicines (Holden 2014). Poaching occurs inside  and outside protected areas. Sources living around protected areas in  Sumatra, such as the Gunung Leuser National Park, Aceh, claim that  hunting continues to increase as illegal logging roads have opened up  parts of the park, allowing access to previously inaccessible areas.  Locals claim that populations of serows have been declining. Trade of  body parts, especially the horns, is conducted openly in some places,  such as in the town of Pancur Batu, North Sumatra. Enforcement action  against individuals trading Serow parts does not occur in these  locations.<br/><br/>In Malaysia, the Sumatran Serow faces several  primary threats from habitat destruction caused by limestone quarrying  and poaching for illegal commercial trade (Shepherd and Krishnasamy 2014). Serows also suffer from substantial poaching for its meat and  body parts that are used for medicinal and purportedly magical purposes  (Rahman 1997). The species is threatened by the widespread setting of  snares and it is targeted species whenever poachers have access to its  rugged habitats (Krishnasamy and Or 2014). Over the past two years,  enforcement authorities have taken action against individuals involved  in illegal hunting of this species, and as a result, trade of this  species is not carried out openly, as it is in other areas of  its-Southeast Asian range. Very little information on current population  sizes of this species exists. Local people living near serow habitat  state that populations seem to be declining, due to hunting and to mining  activities (limestone and quartz). Eighteen out of 165 restaurants, that  served bushmeat in Peninsular Malaysia, offered the meat of this  species (Shepherd and Krishnasamy 2014).<br/><br/>In the Himalayan  range, habitat destruction and resource competition with livestock are  key-threats to the Mainland serow throughout its range, even in  protected areas. Disease transmission (sarcoptic mange and goat pox)  seems to be a rising concern wherever serow overlap with domestic  livestock, particularly sheep. Herders have reported finding dead serow  with symptoms such as extremely dry skin, with rupturing and bleeding  across the body, hair loss and foaming in the mouth in Jammu and  Kashmir, Himachal, Uttarakhand (Khanyari <em>et al</em>. 2019). In  Arunachal’s Tawang district, a recent outbreak of goat pox has severely  impacted serows. According to local people, goat pox emerges every few  years in the region when serow and goral populations reach high  densities (Janaki Mohan pers. comm. 2020), although the other way round  looks rather more likely.<br/><br/>Poaching remains a serious threat to  serow in most parts of Himalayan range. Most hunting in Himachal is  subsistence only and is done particularly in winter months when the  animals are seen more easily. In Arunachal, the serow is widely hunted  both for subsistence and for sale. In Upper Siang district, gun hunting  is rare and local hunters lay snare traps near salt licks. Datta-Roy  (2019) noted that hunting in these community forests is strictly  controlled by village institutions.<br/><br/>Infrastructure development,  including dams and highways in Sikkim and Arunachal, which may be the  species strongholds, are a rising cause of large-scale habitat  destruction.<br/><br/>Habitat disturbance and poaching are the greatest  threats to its survival also in Bangladesh, both related to slash and  burn cultivations (Khan 1985). Over-hunting, habitat destruction by  human and livestock, and habitat fragmentation are main threats to the  serow population decline in Nepal (Aryal 2009, Giri&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011). In  Bhutan, the species is rarely hunted and populations appear to be  stable.</p>","<p>There are no estimates of the total population size and trend of the Mainland serow throughout its range. It is believed that populations have been fragmented and significantly declined through time, and its distribution range has been gradually reduced due to the loss of habitat and intervening forest clearance, with excessive poaching in many areas.<br/><br/>Subspecies <em>Capricornis sumatraensis sumatraensis: </em>No population estimates have been made on the Sumatran Serow. In Indonesia, this sub-species was recorded by camera traps in some national parks, such as Kerinci Seblat and Bukit Barisan Salatan, however, the status of this species is already very rare in these national parks because of deforestation and illegal poaching (Pakpahan&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016, Dwiyahreni Asri pers. comm. 2020). For example, the serow was considered 'rare' in Kerinci Seblat National Park, based on camera-trap surveys in 2005 and 2006 (Leader-Williams&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006) and hundreds of thousands of hour camera-trap surveys in Sumatra in six years, only one photo-trapped at 2,700 m on a volcanic peak (Holden 2014). Also, in Malaysia information on the status of serow is not available, but it is considered threatened and significantly declined in Peninsular Malaysia (Shepherd and Krishnasamy 2014). A total of 30 artificial salt licks were developed in 10 protected areas in Malaysia, and they were monitored in 2011 and 2013 but this sub-species rarely visited these artificial salt licks (Magintan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015).<br/><br/>Subspecies<em> C. s. mildneedwardsii: </em>Populations of this sub-species in southeast China (south of the Yangtze river) are small and isolated, and this subspecies’ general distribution range falls within regions with relatively dense human populations which are well-exploited economic areas (Sung&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1997). Camera-trapping surveys conducted in numerous reserves across this region indicated that serow is the least detected ungulate species and its abundance is extremely low (Chen&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, Li&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018a). Although no population estimates have been made in this area, numbers are believed to be decreasing and its distribution range has gradually been reduced. In southwest China, serow populations are generally considered stable in most well-managed nature reserves, whereas there are cases of a decrease observed in some reserves following the rapid increase of free-ranging livestock over the last few decades (Li., unpublished data). While co-existing with other meso-large bovid species, such as Takin and Goral, in forest ecosystems, serows have the lowest detection and relative abundance according to camera-trapping surveys (Li&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012, Li&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).<br/><br/>In Cambodia the population status of this sub-species is unknown and serows are probably naturally restricted to the hilly and mountainous terrain that surround the Mekong and Tonle Sap central plains. An intensive camera-trap survey was conducted within Phom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary in eastern Cambodia in 2008 and 2009, and 23 species were recorded, including four large ungulate species but serow was not recorded (Gray and Phan 2011). In addition, camera-trap detection levels of this sub-species were low and restricted to the Cardamoms, south-west Cambodia and Virachey National Park, north-eastern Cambodia (Gray&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). In Lao PDR, data on population size and trend of this sub-species are unavailable. However, the sub-species showed a low detection rate in camera-trap surveys in Xe Sap National Protected Area, in southern Lao PDR (Tilker 2014) and has a density of 0.22 individual/km² in Nam Et-Phou Louey National Protected Area in northern Lao PDR (Vongkhamheng&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013). In addition, this sub-species is potentially considered at risk in Lao PDR (Duckworth&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1999). In Thailand, the population and status of this sub-species is unknown and showed a low detection rate in camera-trap surveys, in Dong Phayayen - Khao Yai Forest Complex, in southern Thailand (Lyam&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006). Serows had a very low detection rate in Kuiburi National Park, in south-western Thailand (Steinmetz&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009) and in Thung Yai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuary, in western Thailand (Steinmetz&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010). In Vietnam, population numbers are unknown, an exception being about 26 individuals left in the Cat Ba Island, in north Vietnam (Phan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). This sub-species was recorded in almost all protected areas from northern to southern central areas of Vietnam, but populations are small and scattered, and numbers are probably low (Nguyen Xuan Dang and Le Xuan Canh, 2009; Dang Ngoc Can&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2008). It is believed that populations in the northern highlands are heavily depleted in number and the populations are highly fragmented. However, they are likely to be more present in most protected areas along the Annamite mountains of central Vietnam. For example, five monitoring programs used 591camera traps in Pu Mat National Park in central Vietnam and recorded 94 photos of serows from 2016 to 2018 (Tran Xuan Cuong pers. comm. 2019).<br/><br/>Subspecies <em>C. s. thar:&#160;</em> No counts have been made in Bangladesh, but numbers are believed to be  very low. In addition, serows have not been detected by camera-trap  surveys from 2011 to 2015 in the Sangu Reserve Forest in the  southeastern, Bangladesh (CCA 2016). In Bhutan’s Jigme Singye Wangchuck National Park, Wang (2010) used distance sampling to estimate serow density of 0.36 individuals/km². In India, the population size of this sub-species is not available, but  its density seems to be fair in good habitat: within Kedarnath Wildlife  Sanctuary (Uttaranchal) it has been estimated at 1.6 serow/km² within suitable habitat (Green 1987). This sub-species was frequently detected using camera traps from 2008 to  2010 in Khangchendzonga Biosphere Reserve, Sikkim (Bhattacharya&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2012).  In Arunachal’s Dibang Valley, Nijhawan (2018) estimated serow densities from camera trapped data using at 0.62 (0.26-1.46) and 0.25 (0.10-0.59) individuals/km2 in two separate community forests and 0.19 (0.08-0.49) individuals/km2 in Dibang WLS.

In Himachal, populations are reportedly declining in most areas though local herders report easy detections during winter months (November-February). In Nepal, no estimates of population size are available, but density within the Annapurna Conservation Area has been estimated at 1.17 individual/km², significantly declined over the last few decades (Aryal 2009).</p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Mainland Serow occurs across eleven countries, including China, Southeast Asia and Himalayan range. <br/><br/>Subspecies <em>Capricornis sumatraensis sumatraensis </em>is found in Indonesia (Sumatra), Malaysia (Peninsular Malaya), Thailand (south of about 9°S latitude) (Grubb, 2005). In Indonesia, this sub-species is restricted entirely to the volcanic mountain chain of the Bukit Barisan mountains in Sumatra, especially in the Aceh highlands in the north, the Kerinci highlands in the centre and the Barisan Seletan highlands in the south (Dwiyahreni Asri pers. comm. 2020). It is also found scattered through Peninsular (West) Malaysia, but concentrated in the northern states, especially Kelantan, Perlis and Perak. The species has been recorded in 50 areas in Peninsular Malaysia (Rahman 1997), but the species has significantly decreased in these areas (Shepherd and&#160;Krishnasamy 2014).<br/><br/>Subspecies <em>C. s. mildneedwardsii </em>occurs in much of Myanmar, Cambodia, south and central China (extends to eastern Himalayas and Indo-Burma), Lao PDR, Thailand, and Viet Nam (Grubb 2005). The sub-species is widely distributed through much of central and south-eastern China, including southern Shaanixi, southern Gansu, southeastern Qinghai, western Sichuan, eastern Tibet, Yunnan, Guangzi, Guizhou, Chongqing, Guangdong, Jiangxi, Hubai, Hunan, Anhui, Zhejiang, Fujian provinces. However, this sub-species is replaced in parts of northern Myanmar by <em>Capricornis rubidus</em> (Smith and&#160;Xie 2008).<br/><br/>Records show a more or less continuous distribution along the ranges of the Hungduan mountain system. East of this region, populations occur in adjacent mountain areas of Qinling (Southern Slope), Shaanxi and Guizhou (Zhen 1982). A few populations exist in the north-western Hengduan Mountains of Yushu and Nangqqian (Qinghai) (Li <em>et al</em>. 1989). This subspecies has a comparatively widespread distribution from eastern to southern China, through western and southern Zhejiang, northern Fujian, most of Jiangxi, eastern Guizhou (Luo <em>et al</em><em>.</em>&#160;1985), northern Guangdong, eastern and south-western Guangxi, eastern and southern Yunnan, where it inhabits low mountains and foothills. It may also occur in south-western Sichuan, as indicated by specimens from the adjacent mountains of Jijiang.<br/><br/>Two subspecies (<em>C. s. sumatraensis </em>and <em>C. s. milneedwardsii</em>)<em> </em>originally were widely distributed throughout Thailand, but they are now restricted to steep, forested limestone hills and cliffs, in areas relatively inaccessible to human encroachment (Lovari, 1997). Therefore, their populations are highly fragmented, with a low density (Lovari 1997, Lyam&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, Steinmetz&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). The dividing line between the ranges of <em>C. s. milneedwardsii</em> and <em>C.s. sumatraensis</em> is unclear, but it is suspected to fall somewhere in the Chooporn or Suratchathani Provinces (Grubb 2005).<br/><br/>The historic distribution of <em>C. s. milneedwarsii </em>in Lao PDR almost certainly included the vast majority of the countries, the majority of which is hilly to mountainous (Lekagul and McNeely1988). Currently in Lao PDR the sub-species is restricted to rugged terrain areas, especially along the Annamite mountain range of eastern central and southern Lao PDR (Vongkhamheng&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, Tilker 2014). In Cambodia the species is probably naturally restricted to the hill and mountainous terrain that surround the Mekong and Tonle Sap (lake) central plains (Gray and Phan 2011, Gray&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). In Viet Nam the serows were recorded in almost all protected areas from northern to the south-central areas of the country, especially where forested limestone mountains and cliffs occured (Nguyen Xuan Dang and Le Xuan Canh 2009). During mammal surveys from 1999 to 2008, serows were found in the northern Vietnam, including Ha Giang, Cao Bang, Lai Chau, Tuyen Quang, Bac Kan, Phu Tho, Thai Nguyen, Vinh Phuc, Quang Ninh, Hai Phong, Hoa Binh and Ninh Binh provinces; in the northern central areas of Vietnam, such as Thanh Hoa, Nghe An, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, and Thua Thien Hue; in the central areas of Viet Nam, including &#160;Quang Nam, Kon Tum, Gia Lai, Dak Lac, Dak Nong and Lam Dong provinces, and in the southern central areas of Vietnam, including in Binh Dinh, Binh Thuan and Ninh Thuan provinces (Dang Ngoc Can&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008). The species has also been recorded from offshore islands in the north, e.g. Cat Ba (Phan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). However, there is no further information available on its distribution status and it is believed that this sub-species has significantly declined due to poaching in Viet Nam.<br/><br/>The general distribution in Myanmar appears to follow the forested mountain ranges surrounding the central plains. Its distribution in the northwest is believed to stretch through the Chin Hills from the border with India, probably as far south as 20ºN in the Arakan Yoma range. A larger distribution area occurs in the mountains in the north (Kachin state) and in the mountains east of about 96ºW, to Myanmar’s borders with China, Lao PDR and Thailand (Grubb 2005).<br/><br/>Subspecies: <em>C. s.thar </em>is known to occur in east and southeast Bangladesh, Himalayas (Bhutan, northern India including Sikkim and Nepal), China (Tibet only), northeast India (provinces east of Bangladesh), and probably into western Myanmar (Grubb 2005). This sub-species is widespread though sparsely distributed throughout the Himalayas from Jammu and Kashmir through Nepal and Bhutan till the eastern side of Arunachal Pradesh. Its distribution is generally fragmented and throughout the majority of its range in India, it naturally occurs in low density. In the state of Jammu and Kashmir, its presence has been confirmed through camera traps and direct sightings from the districts of Srinagar (Dachigam National Park, Brien-Nishta Wildlife Conservation Reserve), Kishtwar (Kishtwar National Park), Ganderbal/Anantnag (Overu-Aru Wildlife Sanctuary), and Baramulla (Tangmarg-Gulmarg valleys) (Sathyakumar&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, Tawqir Bhat pers. comm. 2019, Munib Khanyari pers. comm. 2019). In Himachal Pradesh, Pandey (2002) reported that the species is found extensively in the Sutlej and Beas River catchments in the state. More recently it has been confirmed from the districts of Shimla (Rupi Valley, Narkanda Valley, Dodra-Kwar region), Lower Kinnaur (Bhaba valley), Kullu (Great Himalayan National Park including Thirthan, Sainj, Parvati and Jeeva Nala), Kangra (Barabangal region), Chamba (Lower Bharmour and Upper Dalhousie region though believed to be nearly extinct in this area) (Munib Khanyari pers. comm. 2019). They are occasionally sighted in abandoned farmland in these areas. In Uttarakhand, serow presence has been confirmed via camera-trap surveys from Rudraprayag (Kedarnath Forest Division, Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary) (GTF&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019) and Pauri Garhwal (Lansdowne Forest Division) (Pawar&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018), distribution in the rest of the state remains uncertain, but the species is likely be present in forest patches from 500 to 3,500 m in elevation. The serow is widely distributed across Sikkim where camera-trap surveys have confirmed populations in East Sikkim Wildlife and Forest Division (Pangolakha Wildlife Sanctuary, Kyongnosla WLS), North Sikkim Forest Division and Khangchendzonga NP (Sathyakumar&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Bhattacharya&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012; Srivastava and Kumar 2018). In West Bengal, it is extant in Darjeeling Wildlife Division (Singalila National Park) and Gorumara Wildlife Division (Neora Valley National Park) (GTF&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). In Assam, the species occurs in hilly tracts on the north bank of Bramhaputra river and has been reported from the districts of Kokrajhar (Ripu and Chirang Reserve Forests), Sonitpur (Nameri National Park), rare but seen in winter in Lakhimpur (Ranga, Kakoi and Dulung Reserve Forests), and Dhemaji (Subansiri Reserve Forest) (Choudhury 2003).<br/><br/>In Arunachal Pradesh, the sub-species is widely distributed across protected areas and community owned forests from lowland forests up to 3,500 m. Camera-trap surveys, where it is often captured, and hunter interviews have confirmed populations in the districts of Lower Subansiri (Hapoli Forest Division, Talle Valley WLS), Upper Siang (Yingkiong Forest Division), West Kameng (Eaglenest WLS), Tawang and West Siang (Yorde Rabe Subse WLS), Lower Dibang Valley, Dibang Valley (where it is frequently recorded in very steep terrain), Lohit, Anjaw and Changlang districts. In Namdapha Tiger Reserve, the species overlaps with <em>C. rubidus. </em>No records of <em>C. s. thar </em>have emerged south of Tirap and Longding districts in Arunachal. <em>C. rubidus</em> is found in the hill tracts south of Brahmaputra and appears to be the only serow species from southwards from Nagaland into Bangladesh.<br/><br/>Serow appears to be widely distributed in Nepal across its community forests and protected areas and has been reported form Annapurna Conservation Area (ACA), Sagarmatha National Park (NP), Makalu Barun NP and CA, Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve, Langtang NP, Khaptad NP, Rara NP and perhaps in Shey-Phoksundo NP and Chitwan NP. They have also been reported from Kanchanpur, Taplejung, Ramechhap and Illam districts. The only serow-focused research conducted in the country by Aryal (2008) in Annapurna Conservation Area found that the species prefers altitudes between 2,500 and 3,500 m and slopes between 20-40 degrees. The species also appears to be widely distributed in Bhutan up to an altitude of 3,500 m. It is regularly camera trapped in subtropical and temperate zones of Royal Manas, Black Mountain and Jigme Singye Wangchuck National Park.<br/><br/>In China, this sub-species occurs in the forest belt between 2,000 and 3,000 m only in the narrow area on south slope of Qomolangma on the border with Nepal. Observations of serow running across highways are not infrequent. A population is found in the Yaluzangbu Grand Canyon National Nature Reserve, where it inhabits sub-alpine forests and has been recorded in camera-trap surveys and by wildlife photographers (Wen&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, Wu&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, Mcshea&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). In Medog county, southeast Tibet, China, the Himalayan Serow is the most detected bovid species by camera-trap surveys (Wen <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, Wu <em>et al.&#160;</em>2016).</p>",,Terrestrial,"<p>The Mainland serow is listed in Appendix I of the CITES (The Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora), which prohibits international commercial trade of the species, its body parts and derivatives. <br/><br/>In Indonesia, the species has been protected by law since 1932. A total of 3,083,308 ha of serow habitat are under some form of protection in a system of protected areas that includes three national parks, three game reserves, three nature reserves and two protected forests. The species is afforded fully legal protection in Peninsular Malaysia under Wildlife Conservation Act, 2010, which means that hunting this species is prohibited. The serow is classified as Category II on the State Key Protected Animal List, under the Wildlife Protection Law of China (Smith and Xie 2008), and Potentially at Risk in Lao PDR (Duckworth <em>et al.</em>&#160;1999). However, it seems that there is no actual legislation aimed at conserving the serow in Cambodia, Myanmar and Thailand. In Vietnam, the animal is listed as IB (hunting prohibited) in the Endangered and Rare Species List in Degree 32, in 2006, and Endangered (E) in the Vietnamese Red Book, in 2008. The serow is protected under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act of India and Forest and Nature Conservation Act of Bhutan which bans all hunting. In Nepal its hunting is banned by law (Wegge and Oli 1997). The serow is protected under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act of India (WLPA, 1972) and Forest and Nature conservation act of Bhutan which bans all hunting. In Nepal too, it’s hunting is completely banned by law (Wegge and Oli 1997).<br/><br/>So far, there have been just a few research projects focused on the distribution and status of serows throughout its range, except several studies, e.g. in Cat Ba Island, Vietnam (Phan <em>et al</em>. 2014) and in Annapurna Conservation Area, (Aryal, 2008). Camera-trap surveys were conducted by conservation organisations (e.g. WWF, FFI and WCS) in protected areas throughout Southeast Asia to monitor and assess the distribution status of wildlife animals, including serows. For example, in Vietnam, WWF cooperated with Song Thanh Nature Reserve and Bac Hai Van Nature Reserve to monitor wildlife animals through establishing camera-traps, and recorded the presence of serows in these reserves (Mai Sy Luan pers.comm. 2020). Similarly, FFI and SVW conducted a camera-trap survey in Pu Mat National Park to monitor wildlife and recorded the evidence of serows (Tran Xuan Cuong, pers.comm. 2020). WWF-India, Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Nijhawan (2018) and by the Nature Conservation Division of The Department of Forest and Park Service of Bhutan have conducted widespread camera trapping surveys in India and Bhutanese Himalayas. However, these data have not been made available for focused research on this species.<br/><br/>More research on distribution and status as well as the impact of hunting and trading of Mainland Serows throughout its range is urgently needed. In addition, relevant information on the ecology and behaviour of this species should be published and brought to the attention of relevant enforcement agencies, conservation organisations and the public, to advertise the threats that this species is facing, and increase the efforts to save it from further local extinctions.</p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global
163991139,15954,Panthera pardus,Vulnerable,A2cd,2020,2015-07-11 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Leopards are widely distributed across Africa and Asia, but populations have become reduced and isolated, and they are now extirpated from large portions of their historic range. Due to their wide geographic range, secretive nature and habitat tolerance, Leopards are difficult to categorize as a single species. Evidence suggests that Leopard populations have been dramatically reduced due to continued persecution with increased human populations (Thorn <em>et al.</em> 2013, Selvan <em>et al.</em> 2014), habitat fragmentation (UN 2014), increased illegal wildlife trade (Datta <em>et al.</em> 2008), excessive harvesting for ceremonial use of skins (G. Balme pers. comm. 2015), prey base declines (Hatton <em>et al.</em> 2001, du Toit 2004, Fusari and Carpaneto 2006, Datta <em>et al.</em> 2008, Lindsey <em>et al.</em> 2014, Selvan <em>et al.</em> 2014) and poorly managed trophy hunting (Balme <em>et al.</em> 2009). Throughout North, East and West Africa, Middle East, East and South-east Asia, Leopards have suffered marked reductions and regional extirpations due to poaching for illegal wildlife trade, habitat loss and fragmentation, and prey loss. Human populations have increased by 2.57 percent annually from 1994 to 2014 (UN 2014) driving a 57% increase in the conversion of potential Leopard habitat to agricultural areas from 1975 to 2000 (Brink and Eva 2009). Deforestation in South-east Asia has increased for palm oil and rubber plantations (Sodhi <em>et al.</em> 2010, Miettinen <em>et al.</em> 2011). These factors were not incorporated in the previous assessment and likely have a substantial impact on suitable Leopard range.<br/><br/>Comparison of the extent of extant range presented in this assessment (8,515,935 km², see map) with that produced by Red List Assessors in 2007 (21,953,435 km²: Henschel <em>et al.</em> 2008) yields a range reduction of 61%. However the severity of this reduction is inaccurate due to previous insufficient sampling (the 2016 map is much more detailed in resolution, see Methodology in the Supplementary Material), and the reduction has likely occurred over a longer time scale. Though our knowledge of the Leopard distribution is better today than in 2008, it is still limited at the national, regional and range-wide scales because reliable data on Leopard population trends are missing from large portions of their range. We suspect, however, that at least half of the reduction translates to real and relatively recent range loss. Also in southern Africa, the so called stronghold of the Leopard, there is no evidence to suggest that Leopard populations have remained stable (G. Balme pers. comm. 2015). In Zimbabwe, much Leopard range has disappeared due to the resettlement of private farmland and subsequent loss of prey populations (du Toit 2004). We estimate regional range loss of approximately 21% in southern Africa. We suspect that suitable Leopard range has been reduced by &gt;30% worldwide in the last three generations (22.3 years). We calculated generation length as 7.42 years (based on the formula presented in Pacifici <em>et al.</em> 2013 and data from wild Leopard populations presented in Balme <em>et al.</em> 2013). <br/><br/>Leopard population density across the species’ range is known to track the biomass of principle Leopard prey species, medium-size and large wild herbivores (Marker and Dickman 2005, Hayward <em>et al.</em> 2007). Prey species are increasingly under threat from an unsustainable bushmeat trade, leading to collapses in prey populations across large parts of savanna Africa (Lindsey <em>et al.</em> 2013). A commercialized bushmeat trade has caused an estimated 59% average decline in Leopard prey populations across 78 protected areas in West, East and southern Africa between 1970 and 2005 (Craigie <em>et al.</em> 2010). Though ungulate populations have increased by 24% in southern Africa, potential prey numbers have declined by 52% in East Africa and 85% in West Africa (Craigie <em>et al.</em> 2010). Bushmeat poaching in Mozambique (Hatton <em>et al.</em> 2001, Fusari <em>et al.</em> 2006) and Zambia (Lindsey <em>et al.</em> 2014) has severely reduced Leopard prey (Becker <em>et al.</em> 2013) inside and outside of protected areas. Many wildlife areas are suffering from substantial ungulate decline, including Zambian Game Management Areas and National Parks, maintain large mammal populations at 93.7% and 74.1% below estimated carrying capacity, respectively (Lindsey <em>et al.</em> 2014). With such reductions to Leopard prey, we infer a &gt;50% loss of Leopard populations across East and West Africa. Through extensive poaching pressure also in Asia many prey species, such as Sambar Deer in Malaysia, are threatened with regional extirpation throughout tropical forest systems (Corbett 2007, Kawanishi <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>In South-east and East Asia, poaching for Leopard prey and targeted Leopard hunts for the wildlife trade market are taking place. A regional survey found that Leopards in India have been poached at a rate of four individuals per week for the illegal wildlife trade (Raza <em>et al.</em> 2012b). Nowell and Pervushina (2012) found the illegal trade of Leopard parts was comparable to that of Tigers in Asian range States and derivative seizures with an average of 3.5 Leopards seizure cases per month in India since 2000. Preliminary data suggest that the illegal trade in Leopard skins for cultural regalia is rampant in southern Africa. It is suggested that 4,500-7,000 Leopards area harvested annually to fuel the demand for Leopards skins by followers of the Nazareth Babtist (Shembe) Church only (Balme unpub. data).<br/><br/>Poorly managed trophy hunting adds to pressure on local Leopard populations. Balme <em>et al.</em> (2009) showed that trophy hunting was a key driver of Leopard population decline prior to intervention in northern KwaZulu-Natal. Similarly, Pitman <em>et al.</em> (2015) demonstrated that Leopards are over-harvested across much of their range in Limpopo Province, South Africa. The concern about unsustainable trophy hunting has lately increased, e.g. South Africa has banned trophy hunting for 2016. This followed an alert by its CITES Scientific Authority that the number of Leopards in the country was unknown, and that trophy hunting posed a high risk to the survival of the species.<br/><br/>Taken all together, the Leopard meets the A2cd criterion for Vulnerable, based on loss of habitat and prey, and exploitation. These causes of the suspected reduction are not well understood, have not ceased, and are likely to continue, and future decline is anticipated unless conservation efforts are taken.","<strong><em>Habitat Types and Range</em></strong><br/>Leopards occur in the widest range of habitats among any of the Old World Cats (Nowell and Jackson 1996). They are found in the desert and semi-desert regions of southern Africa in Namibia and Botswana. There are remnant populations in the arid regions of North Africa in Egypt, as well as the Arabian Peninsula. They persist in rugged montane regions of southwest Asia in Iran, in a varied range of landscapes in India and in the savanna grasslands of East and southern Africa. Leopards live in mountainous environments up to an altitude of 4,600 m on Mt. Kenya and 5,200 m in the Himalayas. They also thrive in the rainforests of West and Central Africa as well as Sri Lanka and southeast Asia. A remnant Leopard subpopulation also persists in the snowy regions of the Russian Far-East. Leopard subpopulations also occur in suburban and urban environments in India and parts of sub-Saharan Africa.<br/><br/>Leopards have survived outside protected areas in many parts of India since historical times (Daniel 1999) and even today high density of Leopards do occur among high human densities (Singh 2005, Athreya <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013), although associated levels of conflict can also be high (Athreya <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011). Occupancy survey found that Leopards occupied 174,066 km² of forest habitat in India (Jhalla <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008). Despite widespread occurrence they are killed in very large numbers in India (Raza <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2012b).<br/><br/>Leopards prefer to hunt in areas that provide sufficient cover despite higher prey densities elsewhere when sympatric with larger competitors (Balme <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006). <br/><br/><strong><em>Diet</em></strong><br/>Leopard diet is related to prey availability and presence of larger competitors. Generally, Leopards prefer medium-sized ungulate prey (10- 40 kgs) where available (Hayward <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006). They have a highly varied diet, however, feeding on insects, reptiles, birds and small mammals up to large ungulates. Though the Leopard as a species has the reputation of being a generalist, often individuals will become adept specialists for a particular prey item. These individuals will feed almost exclusively on that prey, occasionally supplementing their diet with other food items when necessary. Where competitors are present Leopards will cache their kills under thick vegetation or hoist their prey into the limbs of a tree. Hoisting behaviour is more often recorded where intraguild competitors density is higher. Male Leopards tend to hoist more often than females, particularly in the dry season when available ground cover is scarce (Stein <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> in press). In the absence of larger competitors, leopards feed on larger prey (Ramakrishnan <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1999, Hayward <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006).<br/><br/>In many parts of its range, the importance of domestic animals in their diet is also evident with dogs, goats and cattle forming a large proportion of their diet (Mukherjee <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2001) sometimes even dominating the prey items in the diet (Athreya <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014, Shehzad <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014). Dogs have been reported as important prey for Leopards (Edgaonkar and Chellam 2002, Athreya <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014). Overall studies on diet of Leopards are very scant across its Asian range.<br/><br/><strong><em>Home Range Size</em></strong><br/>Leopard home range size varies with prey availability and habitat structure. Leopards have the largest ranges within arid and semi-arid environs where prey density is low. The largest recorded Leopard ranges include the Central Kalahari (mean = 2,182 km², Bothma <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1997). The smallest recorded ranges correspond to rainforest habitats in south and southeast Asia. In Thailand, Grassman (1999) recorded home ranges as small as 8.8 km² for a female and an average 17.7 km² for two adult males. In India three collared Leopards in human dominated landscapes exhibited home range sizes between 8 to 15 km² (Odden <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014).","The primary threats to Leopards are anthropogenic. Habitat fragmentation, reduced prey base and conflict with livestock and game farming have reduced Leopard populations throughout most of their range (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Ray <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2005, Hunter <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013). The conversion of forest habitats and savanna systems to agriculture, livestock farming and urban sprawl have significantly reduced Leopard range. Though exceptions exist (Athreya <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013), this conversion typically leads to the depletion of natural prey species through poaching thereby reducing the natural prey base in these areas.<br/><br/>Where livestock and game farms have been created, Leopards may feed on these commercially valuable prey causing conflicts with farmers. These farmers may be intolerant to Leopard conflict and kill the Leopards for real or perceived threats to their lives and livelihoods (Stein <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010, Athreya <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011). Recent reports from northern Iraq suggest unsustainable levels of Leopard removal (Raza <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012b).<br/><br/>Leopards are also targets for trophy hunting. If poorly managed, trophy hunting can be detrimental to the population, especially when permits are focused in one geographic area and targeted individuals are in their prime, territorial, reproductively active (Balme <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010). Leopard trophy hunting has been reviewed or closed in Namibia, Botswana, and Zambia within the last five years.<br/><br/>In Indo-Malaya and China, Leopards require better protection from illegal trade in skins and bones (Nowell 2007) and recent reports estimate very high levels of Leopard removal at four individuals per week for 10 years (Raza <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012b). Leopards are also killed for their skins in traditional ceremonies and other parts for medicinal use in eastern cultures. These trades can have a substantial impact on local Leopard populations.<br/><br/>In the face of changing land-use, prey availability and direct mortality from humans, Leopards have persisted where other large predators have not. Their ability to live within human-dominated landscapes and feed on a variety of prey have given many people the impression that Leopards require little concern, however, recent trends have shown that current threats have substantially reduced Leopard populations throughout West and Central Africa, South-west and South-east Asia and China.","Highly adaptable and widely distributed, Leopards can persist in areas where other large carnivores have been extirpated. However, Leopards are declining throughout most of their range (Jacobson <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> in review). There are no robust estimates of the total number of mature individuals range-wide, but several Asian subspecies were assessed as Endangered and Critically Endangered on The IUCN Red List in 2008 and should retain these listings in 2016 based on the following population estimates and a declining trend:<br/><ul><li>Amur Leopard (<em>P. p. orientalis</em>) - Critically Endangered (CR C2a(ii), D):&#160;&lt;60 (Jackson and Nowell 2008, Sugimoto <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014, Xiao <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014).</li><li>Arabian Leopard (<em>P. p. nimr</em>) - Critically Endangered (CR C2a(i)): 45-200 (Mallon <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008).</li><li>Javan Leopard (<em>P. p. melas</em>) - Critically Endangered (CR C2a(i)): 350-525, with &lt;250 mature breeding adults (Ario <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008).</li><li>Sri Lankan Leopard (<em>P. p. kotiya</em>) - Endangered (EN C2a(i)): 700-950 (Kittle and Watson 2015).</li><li>Persian Leopard (<em>P. p. saxicolor</em>) - Endangered (EN C2a(i)): 800-1,000 (Khorozyan 2008).<br/></li></ul>[<strong>Note</strong> that although the Red List Categories and Criteria for the subspecies assessments published in 2008 have not changed, the assessments no longer appear on The IUCN Red List as the information they contain may be out-of-date or may contradictory to the information presented here.]<br/><br/>This current (2015) assessment looked at available information on Leopard status on a regional basis (as discussed below). Across the majority of range, leopards have declined substantially (&gt;30%) since the previous assessment as determined by extensive population surveys, expert input and indirect measures supporting our conclusion that Leopards be listed as Vulnerable (criteria A2cd). Over the past three generations (22.3 years) regional Leopard populations in the Middle East, East and South-east Asia, West, Central and East Africa have seen substantial range declines due to habitat fragmentation and forest clearing, prey reductions from the bushmeat trade, illegal harvest for skins and human-wildlife conflict and retaliation for livestock depredation. Leopards have completely disappeared from regions of North Africa where they were recorded in the previous assessment. In India, the Caucasus and the Russian Far-East, Leopards have maintained their populations or increased due to improved survey methods, expanded range or intensive conservation efforts.<br/><br/><strong>AFRICA</strong><br/>There are few reliable data on changes in the Leopard (<em>P. p. pardus</em>) status (distribution or abundance) throughout Africa over the last three generations, although there is compelling evidence that subpopulations have likely declined considerably. Robust longitudinal data on 47 Lion (<em>Panthera leo</em>) subpopulations—a sympatric large carnivore—demonstrated a 42% decline in abundance across populations in the last three generations (22.3 yrs) (Balme <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Bauer <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> review). Lion population trends decreased in West, Central and East Africa, and increased in Southern Africa. Most of the factors driving Lion population declines (e.g., habitat loss and fragmentation, retaliatory killing due to conflict, poorly managed trophy hunting) also affect Leopards. Indeed, pressure on Leopard populations is likely greater as a larger proportion of their range extends beyond protected areas. The increase in Lion populations in southern Africa was primarily due to the reintroduction of &gt;800 Lions to small, protected reserves in South Africa. Similar reintroductions were not undertaken for Leopards. Fencing of protected areas was proposed as another significant factor contributing to the increase in Lion numbers in southern Africa (Packer <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013). In contrast, fences are far less effective at reducing detrimental edge effects of ‘protected' Leopard populations (Balme <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010) and again, a far greater proportion of Leopard range falls outside protected areas (Swanepoel <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013).<br/><br/>One main factor for Leopard declines in Africa is related to prey declines. Leopard population density across Africa is known to track the biomass of their principle prey species, medium and large-sized wild herbivores (Marker and Dickman 2005, Hayward <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2007). The latter are increasingly under threat from an unsustainable and increasingly commercialized bushmeat trade, leading to collapses in prey populations across large parts of savanna Africa (Lindsey <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013). Time series data from 1970 to 2005 on the main Leopard prey species in 78 protected areas in West, East and Southern Africa, revealed a 59% average decline in population abundance across the three regions. While ungulate and other large mammal populations increased by 24% in southern Africa, they declined by 52% in East Africa and by 85% in West Africa (Craigie <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010). Considering the Leopard’s dependence on wild prey species within its African range, concomitant Leopard declines in the same order of magnitude (&gt;50%) in West and East Africa can be inferred for the same time frame.<br/><br/>Another main driver of range loss and population decline of Leopards in Africa is habitat loss. Leopards have limited levels of ecological resilience to human-caused habitat fragmentation in Africa, and as a result are more restricted to conservation areas. Although male leopards can successfully traverse fragmented and suboptimal habitat (Fattebert <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013), in general Leopards in Africa require large contiguous habitats with low human impacts to reproduce successfully (Balme <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010). However, from 1994 to 2014, the human population in Africa increased by 2.57 percent annually (from 0.699 billion to 1.139 billion) (UN 2014), which in conjunction with a 57% increase in agriculture areas (from just over 200 million ha to almost 340 million ha) from 1975 to 2000 and a 21% decrease in natural vegetation in the region (Brink and Eva 2009) likely have negatively impacted the leopard populations. These increases in human population and habitat fragmentation were not accounted for in the previous assessment. As a subspecies <em>P. p. pardus</em> potentially qualifies as Vulnerable due to suspected population declines.<br/><br/>Although African Leopards can be regarded as a single genetic grouping, geographically they are subject to different pressures that require area-specific categorizations and conservation status assessments. Therefore, we subdivided the African continent into regional units for more detailed and specific status assessments:<br/><br/><u>North Africa</u>: Since the previous assessment, remnant populations in Morocco and Algeria are likely extirpated as recent surveys have failed to confirm their presence (F. Cuzin pers. comm. 2012, F. Belbachir pers. comm. 2014). The Egyptian population is considered very small with only a few observed signs in Elba National Park in southeastern Egypt, whereas there has been no recorded sign in Sinai since 1995 (A. Nagy pers. comm. 2015). Therefore, the North African subpopulation potentially qualifies as Critically Endangered on the basis of a very small and declining number of mature individuals, and a full assessment is recommended.<br/><br/><u>Sub-Saharan Africa</u>: Numbers of sub-Saharan Leopards are declining within large portions of their range, particularly outside of protected areas. The populations within Angola, Zambia, Mozambique, Zimbabwe and South Africa appear to be decreasing from previous estimates with Leopards disappearing from areas with increased human development and areas of intensive conflict with humans (Hatton <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2001, du Toit 2004, Fusari <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2006, Lindsey <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014). Although urbanization is increasing in sub-Saharan Africa (UN 2013), the majority of the population is rural, and about 60–70% of the population relies on agriculture and livestock for their livelihoods, mostly at a subsistence level. As a result, a large portion of the growing human population is expected to depend directly on expansion of agriculture and livestock grazing to survive. By 2050, the population of sub-Saharan Africa is projected to more than double to &gt;2 billion (UN 2013), and the area of cultivated land is project to increase by 51 million ha (approximately 21 %, Alexandratos and Bruinsma 2012), which likely will contribute to the continued population decline of Leopards in Africa. In the absence of proactive management, populations of Leopards and other large carnivores generally decline in concert with increased human population growth (Woodroffe 2000, Linnell <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2001). In summary, the combination of widespread habitat loss (21% in sub-Saharan Africa in 25 years) and prey loss inside African protected areas (59% decline) is likely to have caused concomitant Leopard declines of &gt;30% over the last three Leopard generations. The Leopard subpopulation of sub-Saharan Africa potentially qualifies as VU (criterion A2cd).<br/><br/>Additionally, we strongly recommend detailed status assessments for other areas of Africa to address regional needs and requirements (e.g., Henschel <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2011).<br/><br/><strong>ASIA</strong><br/><u>Indian Leopard (<em>P. p. fusca</em>)</u>: The known range of the Indian Leopard has increased compared to the previous assessment, but this is likely due to more intensive surveys conducted in previously unstudied wild and suburban environments. Poaching for wildlife trade is an increasing threat to Indian Leopards (Datta <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008). For example, Raza <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> (2012b) estimated that four Leopards per week have been poached for illegal wildlife trade over the previous 10 years. Additionally, high conflict is reported in some areas resulting in lethal control of problem individuals (Athreya <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013). Continuous decreases in wild prey are negatively impacting Leopard numbers in some regions (Datta <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008, Selvan <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014), indicating Leopard populations may decline in the future. Moreover, even in well protected areas, the recovery of Tiger numbers often results in lower Leopard numbers (Harihar <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2011, Mondal <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012), as Tigers are known to kill and displace Leopards (McDougal 1988, Odden <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010). The first ever scientific national census of Leopards around Tiger habitats in India (except the northeast) in 2014 estimated 7,910 individuals, with a speculated national total of 12,000-14,000 (Bhattacharya 2015). A full assessment is recommended for <em>P. p. fusca</em>, as it may potentially qualify as Vulnerable due to a suspected declining population containing fewer than 10,000 mature individuals.<br/><br/><u>North China Leopard (classically described as the subspecies <em>P. p. japonensis</em>)</u>: A recent review of Leopard distribution shows a &gt;80% reduction in range considered extant in 2008 (Laguardia <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> in press). This subspecies, endemic to China, now occurs only in parts of seven provinces, and the total population is estimated at &lt;500 individuals (Laguardia <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> in press), with the number of mature individuals likely less than that. Subpopulations are small (&lt;50 individuals) and fragmented, and occur mainly in isolated nature reserves, indicating subpopulations may not be viable in the long-term. Reasons for their decline include retaliatory killings due to conflict, poaching for wildlife trade, low prey numbers (especially ungulates), and habitat loss and fragmentation (Laguardia <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> in press). These threats are expected to continue in the future, indicating that Leopard populations may continue to decline. Therefore, we recommend a full assessment for <em>P. p. japonensis</em> or the subpopulation of North China, as it potentially qualifies as Critically Endangered or Endangered due to a small, steeply declining population.<br/><br/><u>Indochinese Leopard (classically described as the subspecies <em>P. p. delacouri</em>)</u>: A recent review showed a dramatic reduction of over 80% in range where Leopards are considered extant in South-east Asia compared to 2008 (S. Rostro-García and J. F. Kamler unpubl. data). This subspecies is now likely extinct in Lao PDR, Viet Nam, and Singapore, and only small fragmented populations remain in Cambodia, southeastern China, Malaysia, Myanmar and Thailand, resulting in a total estimated population of &lt;2,500 individuals for all of Southeast Asia (S. Rostro-García and J. F. Kamler unpubl. data). Targeted poaching for wildlife trade is probably the greatest factor that contributed to the recent range collapse of Leopards in South-east Asia. Leopard parts are used as substitutes for Tiger parts for medicinal purposes in China and South-east Asia, and Leopard skins are highly sought after as luxury items (J. F. Kamler pers. obs.). Poachers in South-east Asia can get up to $3,000 for a Leopard carcass (S. Prum and R. Maharjan pers. comms. 2014), and this price likely will continue to increase. Other important factors include depletion of prey base, and habitat loss and fragmentation. Throughout all South-east Asian countries and southeastern China, primate and large (&gt;5 kg) ungulate populations are well below carrying capacity due to over hunting by humans, even within protected areas (Johnson <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2006, Steinmetz <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010, Kawanishi <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014), which may hinder recovery of Leopards in the region. Habitat loss and fragmentation are serious threats to Leopards in South-east Asia, particularly because these are closely associated with prey depletion and high levels of human disturbance. The deforestation rate in South-east Asia is the highest of all tropical regions, and the rate is still increasing (Sodhi <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010, Miettinen <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2011). From 2000 to 2010, areas of primary or secondary forests decreased in all Southeast Asian countries, most of which was due to conversion to palm oil and rubber plantations, as the price of these commodities increased 130% and 333%, respectively, during the same period (Wilcove <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013). Because &lt;10% of South-east Asian forests are under some form of protection, and prices of luxury wood, palm oil, and rubber are expected to increase, habitat loss in the region is expected to continue (Sodhi <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010) and thus likely to have negative impacts on the leopard populations. Therefore, we recommend a full assessment for the Sout-heast Asian Leopard subpopulation (<em>P. p. delacouri</em>), as it potentially qualifies as Endangered due to a small declining population.<br/><br/><u>Other subspecies</u>: Leopards of the Arabian Peninsula (<em>P. p. nimr</em>), Java (<em>P. p. melas</em>), and Russian Far-East (<em>P. p. orientalis</em>) continue to require listing as Critically Endangered due to low population numbers and population fragmentation. Although the population of <em>P. p. orientalis</em> may have increased recently, especially on the Chinese side of the border (Xiao <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014), the total population remains &lt;60 individuals. With no noted population or range increase, the Sri Lankan Leopard (<em>P. p. kotiya</em>) should retain its current status as Endangered. The Leopard of southwestern Asia (<em>P. p. saxicolor or ciscaucasica</em>) has been recorded in previously undocumented areas of the Caucasus, such as Georgia and Azerbajian (Sarukhanova 2014, Voskyanyan 2014), however, due to overall low numbers and restricted range, this subspecies should remain listed as Endangered (Khorozyan 2008). See the individual Red List accounts for more details regarding these subspecies.<br/><br/><strong><em>Note</em></strong>: We acknowledge that additional data could reveal an increase or decrease in population size or range loss of Leopards, thus the status could change for segments of Leopard range as more data are collected.",Decreasing,"Our assessment of Leopard distribution has been divided into two geographic regions: Africa and Asia. In order to describe these regions, we have further divided Leopard distribution into sub-regions to address local population trends. A detailed discussion of the methodology used to produce the 2015 range map can be found in the Supplementary Material.<br/><br/><strong><em>Leopards in Africa</em></strong><br/><u>North Africa</u>: Leopard distribution in North Africa has been restricted by 97% of their former range with only remnant, isolated populations remaining (Durant <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014). An adult male Leopard was killed in the Elba region of southeastern Egypt in retaliation for livestock depredation, though evidence of a breeding population is still uncertain (A. Nagy pers. comm. 2014). Continued camera-trapping efforts have failed to capture the presence of Leopard in the Sinai since 1995 (A. Nagy pers. comm. 2015). The presence of Leopards was confirmed in the Ahaggar Mountains of Algeria from the genetic testing of one scat sample in 2005 but no presence has been confirmed since (F. Belbachir pers. comm. 2014). Leopards are thought to be extirpated from Morocco (F. Cuzin pers. comm. 2012).<br/><br/><u>West Africa</u>: Leopard distribution in West Africa has been dramatically reduced. This reduction is likely due to habitat fragmentation, but also more rigorous survey efforts that have confirmed presence and likely absence across the region (P. Henschel pers. comm. 2014). Leopards have been confirmed in Niger along the southwestern border with Benin and Burkina Faso (P. Henschel pers. comm. 2014) but previous reports in Air and Tenere National Reserves are unconfirmed. Leopards are generally restricted to a few protected areas from Senegal in the west to Nigeria in the east. Leopards have been reported in the south of Senegal including Parc National de Niokolo-Koba. In Sierra Leone, there are small remnant populations near Outamba Kilimi National Park and Gola National Forest as well as the eastern boundary with Guinea/ Liberia. Leopard populations in Liberia have been recorded in Lofa-Mano National Park in the west and Sapo National Park in the east. In Ghana, Leopards are found along the boundary with Côte d’Ivoire and Mole National Park in the north and west (<em>c.</em> Burton pers. comm. 2014). In Benin, Leopard are found along the northern boundary. Leopards are nearly absent from Nigeria.<br/><br/><u>Central Africa</u>: In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Leopard range was largely reduced in areas of increased human influence and areas relatively easy to access and therefore open to illegal hunting and bushmeat trade. In Cameroon, Leopards are found in the northern and southern portions of the country. In Gabon, Leopards are found throughout the country with small absent pockets in the southeast and southwest. In the Central African Republic (CAR) Leopards are found in the southwest, central and eastern portions of the country. Leopards are found throughout South Sudan with the exception of the Sudd wetland.<br/><br/><u>East Africa</u>: The distribution of Leopards in East Africa has been reduced, in particular in Somalia, Kenya, Ethiopia and central Tanzania. There are possible remnant populations in Djibouti, Eritrea, and North Sudan. They are nearly absent from Somalia. Leopards are found throughout southern Ethiopia, parts of Uganda and the west, central and southern portions of Kenya (Z. Davidson pers. comm. 2014, I. Seme pers. comm.2014, G. Yirga pers. comm. 2014). In Tanzania, Leopards are found throughout the Serengeti-Ngorogoro Crater system and to the south and west. It is thought that Leopards are absent from the southeastern boundary of Lake Victoria to Central Tanzania.<br/><br/><u>Southern Africa</u>: Southern Africa likely has the healthiest Leopard populations of their entire range. It is generally thought that Angola, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique have declining but healthy Leopard populations outside of human dominated areas (C.<em>&#160;</em>Begg pers. comm. 2014, A. Loveridge pers. comm. 2014, P. Schuette pers. comm. 2014). In Namibia, Leopards inhabit most of the country with the exception of the highly populated northern region, the arid southeast farmlands and the desert coast (Stein 2011). Botswana has a continuous Leopard population in the North and West. In South Africa, Leopards are found along the boundaries with Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe and Mozambique with dense populations located in the Limpopo region. Leopards are also located in the Cape provinces of South Africa.<br/><br/><strong><em>Leopards in Asia</em></strong><br/><u>Middle East</u>: The main stronghold for the Arabian Leopard (<span><em>P. p. nimr</em>) is the continuous tract of the Dhofar area in southwestern Oman and the Hawf area in northeastern Yemen (Khorozyan <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014, Spalton <em>et al </em>2014). There are also small, isolated populations in Saudi Arabia (Zaffar-ul-Islam <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014). In 2006, Leopard populations were estimated at eight individuals in Israel's Judean Desert and Negev Highlands respectively, however, they have not been confirmed since (Perez <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2006). The species is likely extirpated in the Musandam Peninsula of Oman and UAE (J. Spalton pers. comm. 2014, Spalton <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014). Leopards are probably extinct in Jordan (Qarqaz and Abu Baker 2006), UAE (Edmonds <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2006, Spalton <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2006) and Egypt's Sinai Peninsula (Spalton <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2006), with the possibility of rare forays from the Negev (Mallon <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008).<br/><br/><em><strong>Southwest Asia and the Caucasus</strong></em><br/>Recent surveys found that Leopards have a wide distribution in Iran, mostly in the region of the two mountain chains consisting of Alborz running northwest to northeast and Zagros from northwest to the south (Sanei and Zakaria 2011). Their presence is also recorded in Golestan National Park, Iran which is located in the northeastern part of Iran near the border with Turkmenistan (Erfanian <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Hamidi <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014). A few recently confirmed records from Iraq and Turkey are restricted to the mountainous areas of Kurdistan (B. Avgan and H. Raza pers. comms. 2014), where Leopard is known to be scarce. There are numerous camera-trap records dated 2013-2014 confirming the presence of a small population in the Zangezur Ridge shared by Armenia and Azerbaijan (B. Avgan and A. Malkhasyan pers. comms. 2014, Voskanyan 2014, Sarukhanova 2014). Two individuals are recorded in Talysh Mountains of southeastern Azerbaijan (Sarukhanova 2014). There is recent camera trapping evidence from Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, Azerbaijan (Avgan <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012). Recently, a Leopard was video-trapped in North Ossetia, Georgia (P. Weinberg pers. comm. 2014). There are no confirmed recent records in Dagestan although Leopards definitely lived here in low numbers in the 1980s and the last confirmed photograph was taken in 2009 (Yarovenko 2010, Y. Yarovenko pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/><u>South and Central Asia</u>: There is some indication of its presence in the Babatag and Kugitang mountains of Uzbekistan (N. Marmazinskaya pers. comm. 2014). A confirmed record of Leopard was obtained in Afghanistan in the Bamyan province in 2011 in a camera trap image (Moheb and Bradfield 2014). In Pakistan, Leopards also inhabits broken hilly or mountainous country throughout Waziristan, Baluchistan and Sindh Kohistan in association with acacia scrub forest (Roberts 1997). A recent study using DNA from scats found Leopard presence in northeast Pakistan from the Ayubia National Park (Shehzad <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014). Leopards occur widely in the forests of Bhutan and Nepal. Leopards are widespread across India (Athreya <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Harihar <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2009) and Sri Lanka (A. Kittle and A. Watson pers. comms. 2014) occurring inside and outside Protected Areas.<br/><br/><u>Southeast and East Asia</u>: Leopard range has been significantly reduced in southeast and East Asia. The North China Leopard is restricted to small, isolated protected areas in Central China in the Ningxia, northern Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, northern Henan, western Sichuan, southern Qinghai and eastern Tibet regions (Laguardia <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> in press). Leopards of southeast Asia have been confirmed in protected areas in Thailand, Myanmar, Malaysia, Cambodia and southern China but are likely absent from Lao PDR and Viet Nam (S. Rostro-Garcia and J.F. Kamler unpubl. data). Some recent information indicates that they are still present in most forested regions of the island of Java, Indonesia but in very low numbers (H. Gunawan and H.A. Wahyudi pers. comms. 2015). In the Russian Far East, Leopards occur in a large area of about 7,000 km² along the eastern slopes of the East Manchurian Mountains on the border with China but their numbers are likely to be very low (Hebblewhite <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2011).<p></p>","Leopards are targeted for trophy hunting and are illegally hunted for wildlife trade for their skins (used in traditional ceremonies), and bones and other parts (used for  medicinal purposes in eastern cultures).",Terrestrial,"The Leopard is included in CITES Appendix I. Trade of Leopard skins and products is restricted to 2,560 individuals in 11 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Recently, the practices within the hunting industry have been called into question by wildlife researchers and conservationists (Packer <em>et al.</em> 2011). In 2010, the government of Namibia conducted an assessment of trophy hunting in response to calls for an increase in permits amid reports of unethical hunting practices. Zambia placed a moratorium on Leopard and Lion hunting in 2013 due to concerns about the conservation status of the populations. In South Africa, Mozambique and Botswana, researchers have developed regional studies of the hunting quota systems that incorporate measures of trophy quality and regulate the geographic distribution of permits. These quota studies integrate previous hunting data to prescribe the number and distribution of hunting permits with local stakeholder participation.&#160; In 2014, sport hunting has been banned altogether in Botswana while South Africa suspended trophy hunting of Leopards&#160;for the year&#160;in&#160;2016.<br/><br/>Regulating trophy hunting will only address a percentage of Leopard mortality; human-Leopard conflict within livestock and game farming communities is likely the greatest source. In many countries of sub-Saharan Africa, farmers are allowed to kill predators that are considered a threat to life and property with permits distributed retroactively. It is likely that a high percentage of Leopards are killed without reporting and therefore the exact numbers of Leopards killed through actual or perceived conflict is unknown. Generally, efforts to calculate mortality through human-wildlife conflict have been considered unreliable. Since the majority of Leopard range is outside of protected areas, conflict mitigation strategies such as livestock husbandry, compensation/ insurance programmes, alterations in trophy hunting permit distribution and public awareness have all been used to assist farmers and increasing tolerance for living with leopards (Balme <em>et al.</em> 2009, Stein <em>et al.</em> 2010). Where conflict Leopards have been identified, translocation has been tried often with negative results (Weilenmann <em>et al.</em> 2010, Athreya <em>et al.</em> 2011), however, effective translocation criteria have been developed based on suitable release site characteristics (Weise <em>et al.</em> 2015). Namibia and Botswana have promoted wildlife conservation through the devolution of wildlife management and the establishment of benefit sharing initiatives between photographic tour operators, professional hunters and communities through Conservancies and Wildlife Management Areas (WMAs; Jones 1993). These initiatives were modelled after previous efforts such as CAMPFIRE in Zimbabwe.<br/><br/>In North and West Africa, the Middle East and large parts of Asia, Leopards are restricted to protected areas where they are afforded refuge if poaching is not significant. However, many of these protected areas are not large enough to maintain genetically viable populations and will likely require intensive management. In Indo-Malayasia and China, Leopards require increased protection from illegal trade in skins and bones (Nowell 2007). In 2009, Leopards were protected from all hunting and trading within Afghanistan on the country’s Protected Species List (Zahler pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>Since the previous status update, researchers have undertaken population surveys within protected areas throughout Leopard range. These surveys have improved our understanding of Leopard status with greater resolution and in some cases generated population estimates. We recommend increased population surveys for Leopards, in particular across Central Africa, Angola, South-east Asia and China.<br/><br/>To address the use of Leopard skins for traditional ceremonies, conservationists in South Africa have partnered with textile companies and communities to provide faux-fur alternatives (G. Balme pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>Leopard population recovery efforts are currently under way with reintroduction projects in Sochi, Greater Caucasus and the Russian Far East (C.

Since the total occupied area in India has been variously estimated at between 200,000 km² (Johnsingh 2003, Akhtar <em>et al.</em> 2004, Chauhan 2006) and 400,000 km² (Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012), or even more (Puri <em>et al</em>. 2015), it is impossible to gauge population trend from changes in occupied area. However, there is, throughout most of the range, a clear trend in deterioration of habitat, which has caused Sloth Bear populations to decline (Akhtar and Chauhan 2008). This deterioration in habitat is expected to accelerate in the future.<br/> <br/> Habitat outside of protected areas is under severe and growing pressure due to demands for natural resources and the ever increasing populations of both humans and livestock in the region (Akhtar <em>et al.</em> 2006a). This problem is compounded by many factors including that in India, where the vast majority of Sloth Bear habitat is located: 1) the per capita forest area is only one-tenth of the world’s average; 2) there is a demand–supply gap for construction timber leading to over-harvesting and degradation of natural ecosystems; 3) an estimated 78% of forests are subjected to heavy grazing causing degradation of forest habitat; and 4) vast stretches of forest are still diverted for a variety of developmental and infrastructural projects (Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India 2009). The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO 2015) reported that India had a 0.3% rate increase of forest area during 2010-2015, due to afforestation. However, the type and location of all the forest planted is unspecified. Much of this afforestation effort is occurring in more urban areas and it is not known how much is accessible to Sloth Bears.<br/> <br/> The human population growth in India is presently the greatest threat to Sloth Bears. It drives the loss and degradation of habitat and is likely the cause for growing human-bear conflicts in the country. The population of India is expected to increase by 366,000,000 people (roughly 30%) over the next 30 years&#160; (US Census bureau, International database <a href=""http://www.census.gov/population/international/data/idb/informationGateway.php"">http://www.census.gov/population/international/data/idb/informationGateway.php</a>). This extraordinary population growth is likely to have major direct and indirect impacts on Sloth Bear populations, especially those existing outside protected areas. The human population growth of India is particularly alarming because 90-95%of the range of Sloth Bears is in India. Likewise, Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> (2007) predicted a future decline in Sloth Bear numbers in Sri Lanka due to burgeoning human densities and commensurate habitat deterioration and increasing conflicts.<br/> <br/> The recent extirpation of Sloth Bears in Bangladesh (Islam <em>et al.</em> 2013) highlights serious concerns over persistence of small, isolated Sloth Bear populations, especially outside of protected areas, where half or more of the populations exist. Sloth Bears are particularly vulnerable to loss of habitat because of their reliance on lowland areas, which tend to be the places most readily used and developed by people. Moreover, the aggressiveness of this species makes them incompatible with high human populations (Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> 2014). Given the lack of effective measures to control the rate of habitat loss and exploitation, Sloth Bear populations are expected to continue declining, at an increasing rate, resulting in a &gt;30% loss over the next 30 years (three generations).</p>","<p>Sloth Bears subsist primarily on termites, ants, and fruits. Sloth Bears are the only species of bear adapted specifically for myrmecophagy (ant and termite-eating; Garshelis <em>et al.</em> 1999a, Sacco and Van Valkenburgh 2004). Like other myrmecphagous mammals, they have especially small home ranges compared to other ursids (Joshi <em>et al.</em> 1995, Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> 2007a, Akhtar <em>et al.</em> 2006b). The ratio of insects to fruits in the diet varies with the seasonal and geographical availability of each food (Baskaran <em>et al.</em> 1997, Joshi <em>et al.</em> 1997, Bargali <em>et al.</em> 2004, Sreekumar and Balakrishnan 2002, Mewada and Dharaiya 2010, Sukhadiya <em>et al.</em> 2013). Fruits may comprise 70‒90% of the diet during the fruiting season, whereas termites and other insects may comprise &gt;80% of the diet the rest of the year (Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> 2007b, Seidensticker <em>et al.</em> 2011, Yoganand <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/> <br/> Sloth Bears occupy a wide range of habitats on the Indian mainland including wet and dry tropical forests, savannahs, scrublands, and grasslands (Joshi <em>et al.</em> 1995, Sreekumar and Balakrishnan 2002, Akhtar <em>et al.</em> 2004, Yoganand <em>et al.</em> 2006, Seidensticker <em>et al.</em> 2011, Ramesh <em>et al.</em> 2012). They are primarily a lowland species. Most Sloth Bear range in India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka is limited to habitats below 1500 m, although the species may occur as high as 2,000 m in the forests of the Western Ghats (Johnsingh 2003, Seidensticker <em>et al.</em> 2011). In Sri Lanka, Sloth Bears are confined to the remaining dry forests in the north and eastern parts of the island, mostly below 300 m (Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> 2006). In areas where forest cover is sparse but daytime temperatures are high (a large part of the range), the bear is principally nocturnal or crepuscular and shelters in rock outcrops, thickets, and tree cavities during the heat of the day. Although some Sloth Bears may be active during the day in protected areas (Joshi <em>et al.</em> 1999), they tend to be almost exclusively nocturnal in disturbed and fragmented forests interspersed with human habitations (Akhtar <em>et al.</em> 2004; Bargali <em>et al.</em> 2005, 2012).<br/> <br/> Studies in Nepal and Sri Lanka suggest that Sloth Bears avoid areas where human disturbance is high, so crop depredation by Sloth Bears is uncommon (Joshi <em>et al.</em> 1995, Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> 2007a). However, in some parts of India, Sloth Bears routinely raid peanut, maize, and fruit crops (Chhangani 2002, Akhtar <em>et al.</em> 2004, Bargali <em>et al.</em> 2004).&#160; In some of these areas the habitats are severely degraded and affected by human exploitation, including the extraction of several food sources of the Sloth Bear.<br/> <br/> Sloth Bears typically breed May through July, and females give birth, usually to one or two cubs, from November to January (Laurie and Seidensticker 1977, Iswariah 1984, Gopal 1991, Joshi <em>et al.</em> 1999, Chauhan <em>et al.</em> 2003, Spady <em>et al.</em> 2007). Cubs often ride on the mother's back during their first nine months, presumably to reduce the risk of predation. Cubs remain with their mothers for 1.5-2.5 years resulting in a 2 or 3 year interbirth interval (Joshi <em>et al.</em> 1999).</p>","<p>Major threats to this species are habitat loss or degradation (often related to human population growth), retaliation from human‒bear conflicts, and (to a lesser degree) poaching (Johnsingh 2003, Chauhan 2006, Yoganand <em>et al.</em> 2006, Bargali <em>et al. </em>2012, Bargali and Sharma 2013). Habitat has been lost, degraded, and fragmented by overharvest of forest products (timber, fuelwood, fodder, fruits, honey), establishment of monoculture plantations (e.g. teak, eucalyptus), over-grazing, extraction of minerals, quarrying, settlement of refugees, and expansion of agricultural areas, human settlements, and roads (Santiapillai and Santiapillai 1990).<br/> <br/> In some parts of the range, encounters between people and Sloth Bears have led to numerous serious human injuries and many deaths (Rajpurohit and Krausman 2000, Bargali <em>et al.</em> 2005, Dharaiya and Ratnayeke 2009, Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> 2014). Such incidents occur where people frequently use bear habitat, and where the habitat has become severely degraded, prompting bears to seek food and water in closer proximity to humans. Most attacks occur when people and bears surprised each other in thickets or around rock outcrops, where visibility is obstructed: the bear(s)—sometimes multiple adult bears are involved—rush at, pursue, and knock down the person, and often attack the face. Bears that attack or threaten to attack people may ultimately be killed. Sloth Bear attacks outside protected areas are increasing, and hostility of local people towards bears has made bear conservation more difficult (Bargali <em>et al.</em> 2005, Dharaiya and Ratnayeke 2009, Mardaraj 2014). Increasing numbers of Sloth Bear attacks appear to be related to rising human populations (Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/> <br/> The only natural (non-human) threats to Sloth Bears are Tigers (<em>Panthera tigris</em>) and possibly Leopards (<em>P. pardus</em>). The threat of Tiger predation may account for the aggressive nature of Sloth Bears (Joshi <em>et al.</em> 1999). Sloth Bears have been observed fending off Tigers, but they are also occasionally killed by Tigers (Gopal 1991).</p>","<p>Information is available on the area of potentially occupied range in India (Chauhan 2006, Yoganand <em>et al.</em> 2006, Sathyakumar<em> et al. </em>2012), Nepal (Garshelis <em>et al</em>. 1999a), and Sri Lanka (Ratnayeke <em>et al</em>. 2007a,b). The potential Sloth Bear distribution in India was estimated to be <em>ca.</em> 200,000 km² (Johnsingh 2003, Akhtar <em>et al. </em>2004, Chauhan 2006) but the more recent National Bear Conservation and Welfare Action Plan 2012 (Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012) indicated that the occupied range is twice that large (400,000 km²). An even more recent survey suggested that Sloth Bears may occupy 52% of the land area of India (Puri <em>et al.</em> 2015). Notably, though, the latter study was based on very large sampling cells (2,800 km² across a sampling region of nearly 3 million km²), and any cell estimated to be occupied would have been considered as fully occupied; this would inflate the range area considerably. In short, the results of this study do not appear to reflect the reality of Sloth Bear distribution in India as they clearly do not occur in &gt;50% of the land area. Additionally, the model predicts Sloth Bear occurrence in specific places where they are known to be absent, such as Gir Forest. However, the study does demonstrate that Sloth Bears can live in relatively small degraded areas.<br/> <br/> Sloth Bears can occur at high densities. However, there are few reliable Sloth Bear density estimates: most estimates have been based on opinions gleaned from interviews and questionnaires (e.g., Yoganand <em>et al.</em> 2006). The one robust density estimate for this species, which was based on mark–resight of radio-collared bears, yielded an estimate of 27 bears/100 km² for Royal Chitwan National Park, Nepal, and as high as 72 bears/100 km² in a core area of the park (Garshelis <em>et al.</em> 1999b). Gopalaswamy (2006) attempted a rigorous estimate based on presence-absence records at camera traps (as per Royle and Nichols 2003), but detection rates were too low to produce a useful estimate.<br/> <br/> Attempts have been made to apply estimated densities in various protected areas to all occupied areas to obtain a range-wide population estimate. Depending on methods and data employed in this process, range-wide estimates have varied from &lt;10,000 to &gt;20,000 bears (Garshelis <em>et al.</em> 1999a, Chauhan 2006, Yoganand <em>et al.</em> 2006, Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012). None of these estimates are considered reliable enough to track changes in population size, especially since the total range area is not well defined. Estimates for individual Indian states are also not reliable enough to track population trends (Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/> <br/> The population of Sloth Bears on the island of Sri Lanka is equally not well understood. Santiapillai and Santiapillai (1990) tentatively reported a population of 300–600 bears for the island. Ratneyeke <em>et al.</em> (2007a) estimated, based on home ranges of radio-collared bears that Wasgomuwa National Park alone may support more than 100-150 sloth bears. This national park only makes up roughly 5% of the known Sloth Bear range in Sri Lanka and therefore the population likely well exceeds the previous estimate.<br/> <br/> Increased habitat fragmentation and a decrease of occupied habitat have been observed in many parts of the Sloth Bear range (Akhtar and Chauhan 2008, Bargali 2012, Bargali and Sharma 2013). However, rigorous assessments of population change are rare. Jhala <em>et al.</em> (2011) compared occupancy of Sloth Bears in select areas from 2006 to 2010, during a comprehensive Tiger survey across India, and reported five decreasing, four increasing, and three stable bear populations; although the methods and short time span between surveys probably precluded a reliable indication of population trend.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Sloth Bear’s historical distribution includes a large portion of India, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka, as well as the southern lowlands of Nepal and presumably Bhutan. Some unverified reports suggested that they once occurred in the western-most corner of present day Myanmar (Erdbrink 1953), but this was never confirmed and seems unlikely based on the mountainous habitat. Historically this species overlapped the distributions of Asiatic Black Bears (<span class=""sciname""><em>Ursus thibetanus</em>) in northern India (Bargali <em>et al.</em> 2012), and with both Asiatic Black Bears and Sun Bears (<em>Helarctos malayanus</em>) in northeastern India (Choudhury 2011).&#160;Historical records are confusing, though, because Sloth Bears and Asiatic Black Bears look alike and were often not reliably distinguished.<br/> <br/> <strong><u>India</u></strong><br/> At least 90% of the present Sloth Bear range occurs in India. Within India their distribution is constrained to the south by the ocean, to the northwest by deserts, and to the north and east by mountains. Although Sloth Bears were once common and even abundant throughout the Indian Peninsula (McTaggart Cowan 1972, Krishnan 1972, Brander 1982), their range has shrunk and densities reduced due to continuous habitat loss and human-caused mortalities. Although still found scattered across much of its former range, their actual distribution is now highly fragmented and confined mainly to five distinct regions, namely northern, northeastern, central, southeastern, and southwestern (Garshelis <em>et al</em>. 1999a, Johnsingh 2003, Yoganand <em>et al.</em> 2006, Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/> <br/> The northern distribution region occurs largely within the state of Uttarakhand (Bargali 2012), but also includes the neighbouring states of Uttar Pradesh and the northwestern tip of Bihar. This northern region borders the southern and western areas of Nepal and includes trans-border populations. However, the northern region remains completely isolated from the other population regions in India due to large scale forest removal and agriculture and human settlements.<br/> <br/> The northeastern region is the farthest east that this species occurs and is perhaps the least understood region in terms of Sloth Bear distribution. The bulk of the distribution appears to occur in the state of Assam (Choudhury 2011, Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012), though Sloth Bears are also known from Manipur, Megalaya and Arunachal Pradesh (where it is very rare). The fact that the distribution of Sloth Bears in this region overlaps with that of both Asiatic Black Bears and Sun Bears has made reports of Sloth Bear occurrence less reliable.<br/> <br/> The central region is the largest region. The bulk of the distribution occurs in the states of Madhya Pradesh and Chattisgarh, but includes the states of Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal. Just south of this region, in the southern half of Andhra Pradesh, is the southeastern region, which occurs along the Eastern Ghats. It is not known whether bears move between the central and southeastern regions.<br/> <br/> The southwestern area follows the Western Ghats and principally falls within the states of Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, where there may be a connection to the southeastern region. They have been observed up to 2,000 m elevation in the Western Ghats (A.J.T. Johnsingh, personal communication, in Garshelis <em>et al.</em> 1999a). They also stretch northwestward into Gujarat and Rajasthan.<br/> <br/> <strong><u>Nepal</u></strong><br/> In Nepal, Sloth Bears are most common within the narrow strip of lowland grassland–forest mosaic called the Terai. They also range into the lower Siwaliks (maximum elevation is unknown). The bears are mainly in protected areas in the central and western portions of the Terai. Since the mid-1980s, they were thought to have been extirpated from the Sukla Phanta Wildlife Reserve in western Nepal, an area containing the largest patch of continuous grassland in Nepal (Garshelis <em>et al.</em> 1999b). However, during a 2013 Tiger camera trap study in the reserve a photo of a Sloth Bear was captured. Then in 2014 Sloth Bear tracks and scat were recorded in the reserve as well (Babu Ram Lamichane, National Trust for Nature Conservation—Suklaphanta Conservation Program, pers. comm., 2015). Therefore, it appears that Sloth Bears have recolonized Sulka Phanta Wildlife Reserve, likely from adjacent Piliphit Tiger Reserve in Uttar Pradesh, India, which is known to have Sloth Bears (Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012); alternately, Sloth Bears persisted in such small numbers that they went undetected for several years (Johnsingh 2003). Some of the Sloth Bear populations in Nepal remain connected with the Indian northern region (Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/> <br/> <strong><u>Bangladesh</u><br/> </strong>Sloth Bears have been extirpated from Bangladesh (Islam <em>et al.</em> 2013). The last documented records are from the mid-1990s (NCSIP-1 2001, Sarker 2006). Although they had been present in the southeastern, eastern and northeastern parts of the country, the forest patches in which they persisted have been largely removed (Sarker 2006).<br/> <br/> <strong><u>Bhutan</u></strong><br/> Recent investigations suggest that if Sloth Bears occupy Bhutan, they are very rare. Garshelis <em>et al.</em> (1999a) mapped two populations of Sloth Bears in Bhutan, including Royal Manas National Park (RMNP) and Phipsoo Wildlife Sanctuary. Their range map was based on habitat-elevation information and purported documentation of presence.&#160; However, due to frequent confusion in distinguishing Sloth Bears from Asiatic Black Bears, it is now apparent that this range map was wrong. Sloth Bears appear to have a much narrower range in Bhutan, if at all. One camera trap photo in RMNP, taken in 2009, 2 km from the Indian border, is the only current verified record of presence (Garshelis <em>et al.</em> 2015). Grasslands, which are preferred habitat for Sloth Bears (Garshelis <em>et al.</em> 1999 a,b; Choudhury 2011) are present in both RMNP and Phipsoo Wildlife Sanctuary, and both of these protected areas are connected to protected areas in India, known to contain sloth bears. However, it is not known whether a true trans-boundary population exists anywhere along this border, or if just a few vagrant bears occasionally come across to the Bhutan side (Garshelis <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/> <br/> <strong><u>Sri Lanka</u></strong><br/> The Sri Lankan Sloth Bear subspecies is distributed in the north and east sides of the island and is closely tied with forest cover (Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> 2007a). Sloth Bears occupy roughly 17% of the island and there is still a high connectivity between occupied areas. However, recent civil war activities largely occurred in the northern and eastern sides of the island, which are home to the largest contiguous forest patches and which historically supported healthy Sloth Bear populations. These areas have gone largely unprotected and it is still unknown how sloth bear distribution may have been affected (Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> 2006, 2007a).</p>","<p>Poaching of Sloth Bears for trade in parts has been reported (Servheen 1990, Garshelis <em>et al.</em> 1999a, Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012), but its current extent and impact on bear populations is uncertain. Compared to other Asian bear species, commercial trade in Sloth Bear parts appears to be relatively low (Burgess <em>et al.</em> 2014). Poaching also occurs for local use: male reproductive organs used as aphrodisiac; bones, teeth and claws used to ward off evil spirits; bear fat used for native medicine and hair regeneration (Santiapillai and Santiapillai 1990, Seshamani and Satyanarayan 1997, Chauhan 2006). Occasional rashes of poaching incidents have been reported. For example, in Madhya Pradesh in 2014, at least eight male bears were found professionally poached, as indicated by the skilful removal of their reproductive organs, gall bladders and claws (Basu 2014, Naveen 2014). Two of the dead bears were found near the buffer area of Khana Tiger Reserve, while the others were found in less protected forests in the state. The manner in which the bear parts were removed led many to speculate that that the poaching may be taking place on a larger scale and that the parts may have been removed for illegal international trade.<br/> <br/> The capture of cubs, which often includes the killing of the mother bear, for use as street-show ""dancing bears"" (Seshamani and Satyanarayan 1997) used to be a threat in some parts of India, but has been controlled to a significant level (D’Cruze <em>et al.</em> 2011). This practice has been illegal in India since 1972, though it continued in earnest until 2009. However it persists to a small degree in southern Nepal. It is unclear if the practitioners were always in Nepal or if they crossed the border to Nepal from India due to the political pressure to end the practice in India. Several dancing bears have been confiscated at the Nepal-India border while they were being brought into India (K. Satyanarayan, Wildlife SOS, personal communication, 2015). Additionally, a cub was rescued that was being smuggled into Nepal with clear signs that it was to be sold for use as a dancing bear (Wildlife SOS 2015).</p>",Terrestrial,"<p>Sloth Bears are listed in Appendix I of CITES and are completely protected under Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. They are also protected to varying degrees by national laws in the other range countries. However, they can be killed to protect life or property.<br/> <br/> Sloth Bears are reported to exist in 174 Protected Areas (PAs) in India, which include 46 National Parks and 128 Wildlife Sanctuaries (Chauhan 2006). Populations appear to be reasonably well protected when inside these PAs, but face deteriorating habitat conditions outside (Santiapillai and Santiapillai 1990, Akhtar <em>et al.</em> 2004, Dharaiya, 2009). Reduced cover and food resources outside PAs (Akhtar <em>et al.</em> 2004) have led to increased human–bear conflicts, including frequent maulings (Bargali <em>et al.</em> 2005). It is estimated that half to two-thirds of the Sloth Bears in India live outside PAs. Roughly half the occupied range in Sri Lanka occurs outside PAs (Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> 2007b).<br/> <br/> Human-bear conflicts, both crop raiding and bear attacks, are a growing concern for this species. Given the aggressive nature of this animal, and the increasing number of encounters between bears and people, these bears are widely feared. Although education may help reduce human-bear conflicts and enhance a conservation ethic among locals, the root of the problem is largely related to the expansion of human settlement and deteriorating habitat, which increases the chance of interaction between people and bears. Thus, habitat improvements (government or community-based reforestation) would be helpful in alleviating such conflicts. Potential solutions to this problem have not been studied in depth and further research on this issue is critical to getting this problem under control. The planting of fruit trees, to provide both food and cover, has been undertaken in several states in India.<br/> <br/> Other projects to help ameliorate human-bear conflicts will probably need to be implemented for a number of years to produce useful outcomes; long-term funding will thus be needed to advance the science of human-bear conflict resolution. Where sufficient human resources and funding exist, conflict rapid-response teams (staffed by NGOs, government personnel, and local people) can be effective. Safety guidelines can be devised and disseminated, based on knowledge of bear behaviour and ecology, to help people avoid bears or minimize chances of being attacked. Better methods to deter bears are also needed. Additionally, educational efforts to increase awareness and promote greater tolerance are likely to be keys to success.<br/> <br/> Aside from the global Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan for this species, published by the IUCN in 1999 (Servheen <em>et al.</em> 1999), India developed a National Conservation Action Plan for bears (Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012). This action plan was developed through a wide range of consultations with stakeholders and covers all four species present in India. The plan emphasizes mitigation of human-bear conflicts, increased habitat management, enhanced research and information gathering, capacity building, and improved communication and education. Priority actions in the action plan include: strengthening methods of crop and livestock protection; reducing bear-caused human injuries, creating rapid response teams to investigate conflicts with bears (and possible claims for monetary compensation); enhancing human tolerance toward bears; identifying critical habitats and corridors used by bears, especially those outside PAs; increasing habitat protection and restoring degraded habitats outside PAs; reducing dependency of local communities on resources needed by bears; discouraging shifting agriculture; developing methods to track population size and trends; involving communities in bear monitoring programs; equipping forest and wildlife staff with adequate knowledge and modern equipment to manage all types of human-bear interactions; and developing an advocacy program for bear conservation through active communication to the public and pressure on corporations and politicians.</p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global
166520460,7951,Equus hemionus,Near Threatened,,2020,2015-05-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is assessed as Near Threatened (NT) because a population decline of at least 20% is projected over the next three generations, based on old prevailing and newly emerging risks, thus approaching Vulnerable (VU) under A3bcd. <br/><br/>Although the global population is large and currently appears stable, the rapid infrastructure development and the associated influx of people in large parts of the species range could quickly result in the re-emergence of old threats (e.g. increased competition with livestock for water and pasture, high poaching levels). Furthermore, linear infrastructure (e.g. roads, railways, canals) - if not carefully designed and mitigated - are likely to result in high mortalities if Wild Asses are impeded in their long-distance movements and become cut-off from important resources or refuge areas. Mongolia, which currently houses over 75% of the global population, is at a crossroad and the outcome will depend on Mongolia’s ability to become “a global model for demonstrating that major economic development projects can proceed without degrading ungulate migrations” (Batsaikhan <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>Though global dynamics are primarily driven by the large Mongolian population, locally there are both increasing and decreasing trends with some populations in Turkmenistan, Iran, Kazakhstan and China being threatened with immediate extinction. Furthermore, several population estimates are rather old and methods are rarely standardized. Consequentially, the different subspecies have also been assessed individually.","Asiatic Wild Asses inhabit mountain steppe, steppe, semi-desert and desert plains, but nowadays have become mainly confined to the low productivity semi-desert and desert plains (Bannikov 1981, Kaczensky <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011a). Wild Asses can be found in hill country and are able to cross over mountain ranges, but generally seem to avoid steeper terrain, particularly slopes &gt;20° (Kaczensky <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011a).<br/><br/>Wild Asses have a feeding strategy similar to that observed in other equids in xeric environments. When grass is plentiful, Asiatic Wild Asses are predominately grazers. During the dry season and in drier habitats, Asiatic Wild Asses will supplement their diet with shrubs and switch to become mixed-feeders during certain seasons (Bannikov 1981, Xu <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012, Burnik-Sturm in prep.). Wild Asses, like all equids, need regular access to water and in captivity drink 1,020 litres daily, although they seem to be able to go without water for two to four days depending on ambient temperature and moisture content of the feed (Bannikov 1981, Kaczensky <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010). Water availability is a key resource and in summer months the species primarily occurs within 10-15 km of standing water. In Mongolia where the ground water level is high, Asiatic Wild Ass have been observed digging holes as deep as 60 cm in dry riverbeds to access water (Feh <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2002, Stubbe <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2005).<br/><br/>Wild Asses are highly mobile, in the Mongolian Gobi collared animals covered average daily straight line distances of 11.9 km (Kaczensky <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2006) or cumulative distances of 21.8 km (Kaczensky unpubl. data) within 24 hours. Wild Ass movements do not seem to follow easily predictable patterns (classical migration), but are rather nomadic. This is likely the result of the unpredictability in the availability of pasture and water in space and time (Kaczensky <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2008, Kaczensky <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011a, von Wehrden <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012). In the past, when Wild Asses still occurred on mountain steppe and steppe habitats, they made seasonal migrations between summer ranges on the productive steppe habitats in the north to winter ranges in the drier, but less snowy areas in the south (Bannikov 1981).<br/><br/>Asiatic Wild Asses in Mongolia have huge annual ranges, the size of which increase from east to west, likely as a result of increasing unpredictability of pasture and water availability. In the Dzungarian Gobi annual ranges averaged 5,860 km<sup>2</sup>, in the Transaltai Gobi they ranged between 14,695-16,907&#160;km<sup>2</sup>, but in the southeast Gobi ranged from 18,186-69,988&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Kaczensky <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011a, Batsaikhan <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>Age at first reproduction seems to be three years for mares and five years for stallions. Mares can produce a foal annually under favourable conditions up to at least 15 years of age. Sex-ratio at birth is close to 50/50 (Bannikov 1981, Saltz and Rubenstein 1995, Volf 2010). Area specific data of Asiatic Wild Ass population dynamics parameters are largely lacking or anecdotal. For the re-introduced and intensively studied population on Barsa Kelmes Island average fertility of adult mares was estimated at 66.6%, but varied depending on pasture condition and winter severity (Bannikov 1981). Foal survival in the wild likely is in the magnitude of 50% and yearling survival is lower than adult survival (Feh <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2001, Nowzari <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012, Kaczensky pers. obs.). Age determination of 350 skulls of Asiatic Wild Ass carcasses from the Mongolian Gobi documented a mean age of 9.1 years (for animals ≥3 years) and a maximum age of 29 years (Lkhagvasuren <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013, Lkhagvasuren <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> in prep.). Average annual foal rates seem to be somewhere in the range of 1,020% (Bannikov 1981, Feh <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2001, Stubbe <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012). The species is polygynous and thus only a portion of the adult males contributes to reproduction, though what percentage is unknown, particularly as there is still limited understanding of the social organization of the species (Solomatin 1973, Bannikov 1981, Rubenstein 1986, Feh <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1994, Klingel 1998 Shah 1993, Feh <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2002 Neumann-Denzau and Denzau 2007, Rubenstein <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2007, Shah and Qureshi, 2007, Sundaresan <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2007, Kaczensky <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2008).<br/><br/>Data on population composition and age specific mortality rates are unavailable and most surveys did not state if and how foals were included in the estimates. Without more robust population dynamics data we assumed that the number of mature individuals roughly equals 50% of the total population making for a global population of mature animals of 27,900 animals.<br/><br/>We also compared our estimate with the known population composition of one re-introduced Przewalski’s horse (<em>Equus ferus przewalski</em>) population that shares part of the range of Asiatic Wild Asses in the Mongolian Gobi and nine Cape mountain zebra populations in South Africa. In the Przewalski’s horse population the proportion of mature individuals (≥3 years for mares and ≥5 years for stallions) averaged 61% (Kaczensky <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> unpubl. data 2009, 2014) and for the Cape Mountain zebra populations ranged between 55-65% (S. King pers. comm. 2014, based on H. Hrabar unpubl. data).","Threats to Asiatic Wild Asses stem from illegal hunting for meat, hides and fat, which like liver is believed to have apparent medicinal properties (Bannikov 1981, Wingard and Zahler 2006, Stubbe <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2007), competition with humans and livestock over water and pasture use (Kaczensky <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006), and crop depredation (primarily in India, Iran and Turkmenistan; S. Esmaeili pers. comm. 2013, N. Shah pers. comm. 2014, N. Khudaykuliyev pers. comm. 2014, Feh <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2002). Other threats are habitat loss as a result of human settlement and cultivation, overgrazing and degradation, and limited access to open water sources (the mere presence of people and their livestock at water points can limit or block access for wild ass; Denzau and Denzau 1999, Kaczensky <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006, Kaczensky <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010).<br/><br/>Of increasing concern is the continued habitat fragmentation by linear infrastructure development projects (mostly roads and railways) associated with the booming extractive industry in Mongolia and China. Asiatic Wild Asses are unable to cross fences (e.g. along the border between Mongolia and China or Iran and Turkmenistan, or fenced transportation corridors like the Ulaanbaatar-Beijing railway), have long flight distances from vehicles in areas with a high poaching pressure, and suffer from vehicle collisions (e.g., from 2009-2013, 26 Wild Asses were killed by traffic in Israel; Waner 2014). If not mitigated, fenced and/or high volume traffic corridors can be expected to create serious movement barriers (Batsaikhan <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>Wild Asses have become largely confined to semi-desert and desert areas with a high variability in water and pasture availability. To cope with this unpredictable environment and track the scarce resources available, Wild Asses need to have access to large tracts of land. This is particularly true in times of weather extremes, when&#160;Wild Asses&#160;need to outrun summer droughts or extreme winters (Kaczensky <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011b). Although protected areas may provide important refuges, long-term conservation of&#160;Wild Asses&#160;will have to happen on the landscape scale. New planning tools are needed, like the “planning for a moving target” approach suggested for Saiga (<em>Saiga tatarica</em>) in Kazakhstan (Singh <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011, Bull <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013).<br/><br/>Small, isolated populations are demographically and genetically vulnerable and prone to extinction, particularly in habitats with frequent environmental extremes (Kaczensky <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011b, Saltz <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006). Small and localised populations also have limited resilience to disease outbreaks&#160;or climate change. For example, a disease outbreak of African horse sickness in the 1960s resulted in a major decline and the extinction of small Khur populations (Gee 1963).<br/><br/><strong>Specific threats to particular populations are outlined below:</strong><br/><br/>The main threats to Khulan in <strong>Mongolia </strong>remain competition for water and pasture with livestock. The temporally high illegal offtake in Mongolia seems to have largely ceased, but could be resumed if the economic situation becomes unstable. Newly emerging threats are rapid infrastructure development particularly in connection with resource extraction industries (mining) that could result in barriers to migrations/nomadic movements (Batsaikhan <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014) and habitat loss and degradation. The impacts of mining operation tapping into “ancient” aquifers on the active ground water table are not fully understood. The situation is complicated by a lack of capacity and funding to implement landscape scale planning and conservation. Furthermore, an estimated 60,0000 illegal “ninja” miners are degrading the habitat, polluting water sources and causing huge disturbance, though initiatives are under way transforming ninja mining into a formal sub-sector and developing mercury free processing techniques.<br/><br/>Threats in northern <strong>China </strong>stem from intensified resource extraction which already resulted in the de-gazetting of parts of Kalamaili Nature Reserve, fencing and competition with local herders and their livestock (Xia <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014). The situation in Gansu province is data deficient and potentially Wild Asses no longer occur in that region. The situation in Inner Mongolia is also unclear, the fence along the international border with Mongolia currently inhibits population exchange between the two countries.<br/><br/>Threats to Khur in the Little Rann of Kutch in <strong>India </strong>stem from increasing human activities. Land use patterns have changed since the Mega Narmada Dam Project which resulted in the Sardar Sarovar canals all around the protected area (Goyal <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1999). Uninformed release of Sardar Sarovar canal excess waters into the Rann is having an impact on the micro-habitat, the short grasslands and is restricting the movement of Khur and other species across the saline desert. Increased agricultural practices have converted fallow lands into irrigation fields, resulting in shrinking habitat for the existing Khur population. Religious activities, cattle breeding and influx of people have accelerated on the Islands or Bets of the Rann.<em> Prosopis juliflora</em> invasion is an additional threat to the habitat. An estimated 30-35% of the Khur population lives outside the protected area and human-Khur conflicts are increasing, particularly crop raiding. In recent years Khur have also been increasingly hit on the major express highway. The International Boundary with Pakistan has been fenced thus restricting any possibility of Khur movement beyond borders. Although the population has somewhat increased over the past years, foaling rates in Khur have been on the decline in recent years (N. Shah pers. comm. 2014). <br/><br/>In <strong>Kazakhstan </strong>Kulan in Altyn Emel National Park are thriving, but are believed to have reached carrying capacity. Transfers to Andassay Sanctuary have been resumed, but the status and whereabouts of the reintroduced animals is largely unknown due to a lack of post-release management. Poaching still seems to be a threat outside of Altyn Emel National Park.<br/><br/>In <strong>Iran </strong>upgrading the core zone of Bahram-e-Goor protected area to Qatrouiyeh National Park and providing water supplies and occasional hay resulted in an increase of the Onager population. In contrast, the large adjacent Bahram-e-Goor protected area seems to act as a sink for the population due to occupation of water sources and productive ranges by livestock coupled with insufficient capacity for ranger presence and patrolling. As a result, the Onager population is concentrated in Qatrouyeh national park, which is starting to show signs of high herbivory pressure from Onagers. In Touran protected area the distribution range and abundance of Onagers have been decreasing. Occupation of suitable Onager habitats by livestock, poaching (usually by chasing the animal by motorbike) and insufficient protection are the most important threats to the species in this reserve.<br/><br/>The situation of Kulan in <strong>Turkmenistan </strong>and <strong>Uzbekistan </strong>is largely data deficient. The accuracy of population estimates and the distribution range are unclear. The border fence with Iran and Afghanistan does not allow for cross-border movements to the south any more. The autochthonous population in the Badkhyz Strictly Protected Area is declining. Large parts of the Wild Ass population in Badkhyz leave the Strictly Protected Area in summer to access water sources like the Kuska or Islim rivers close to the Afghan border. Outside the protected area, competition with livestock and crop raiding leads to conflicts with the local population. Poaching remains a problem and harassment by shepherds and their dogs and overgrazing by livestock limits Kulan access to pastures and water outside the reserve (N. Khudaykuliyev pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>The reintroduced wild ass population in <strong>Israel </strong>lives in an extremely arid environment prone to droughts and in summer there are only three permanent water sources (all artificial) within the current distribution area. Presently the major known mortality cause is Wild Ass vehicle collisions. Although population size has doubled since 1999, an increase in the probability of extreme events under the predicted climate change scenario may still make this population vulnerable to extinction as modelled by Saltz <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2006). Another simulation model, based on changes in allele frequencies, suggests that a strong polygynous mating system is leading to increased genetic drift (Renan <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015).","Population estimates of Asiatic Wild Asses are based on a wide variety of different field methods and estimation techniques ranging from attempted total counts based on ground transects or counts at strategically important habitat features (e.g. water points, winter range), population estimates based on strip transects or line transects either from the ground or air, and sign surveys. Details on survey design or details on the statistical procedures that lead to the final population estimates were rarely available. Funds and capacity for monitoring are often very limited and several population estimates are rather old. Consequently, estimates provided should be treated as best available information on the magnitude of the Wild Ass populations and their trends in the respective countries.<br/><br/>Free ranging Asiatic Wild Ass populations currently occur in eight countries in 17 more or less isolated populations with an estimated global population of 55,000 animals.<br/><br/>The largest remaining Wild Ass population, found in southern Mongolia and parts of adjacent China, had been estimated at 18,411 (± 898) for Mongolia in 2003 based on ground transects (Lhagvasuren 2007). However, new counts suggest that this survey greatly underestimated the population due to methodological constrains of covering such a huge area on the ground. A large-scale aerial survey estimated 32,843 (± 10,571) Wild Asses over 150,000 km<sup>2</sup> in the southeast Gobi in 2013 (Norton-Griffiths <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2015) plus likely an additional 1,723 Wild Asses in the no-flight buffer zone along the Mongolian-Chinese border based on a parallel ground survey (Norton-Griffiths <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2013). Three large-scale spring time ground surveys resulted in comparable population estimates of 35,899 (18 %CV) in 2013, 39,998 (27%CV) in 2014, and 36,298 (27%CV) in 2015 (Buuveibaatar <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> in prep.) A simultaneous point count in 2010 estimated another 5,671 (3611–8907) Wild Asses over 11,027 km<sup>2</sup> in the Dzungarian Gobi (Ransom <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2012). These data suggest a population of over 40,000 individuals in Mongolia, with likely an additional 1,500 in the Transaltai Gobi as there have been no reported changes there since the 1997 aerial survey (Reading <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2001), plus further animals in the eastern Gobi, giving an estimate of over 42,000 animals. Based on these updated population estimates, Mongolia houses 75% of the global population of Asiatic Wild Ass. Genetic analysis of samples collected from 2002–2005 suggested gene flow over the entire range in Mongolia (Kaczensky <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2011), but this may have been compromised by recent infrastructure development.<br/><br/>An additional ~5,000 Wild Asses are believed to occur in adjacent China, primarily in Xinjiang province (Q. Cao pers. comm. 2014 based on Bi 2007, Chu 2008). With the upgrading of the fence along the international border in the 1980s and 1990s, population exchange between Mongolia and China has likely ceased or at least become minimal (Kaczensky <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2011a, Kaczensky unpubl. data). Consequently, the Chinese populations should be regarded as separate from Mongolia.<br/><br/>The third largest population is found in the Little Rann of Kutch in India (Shah and Qureshi 2007). In 2009 the official estimate for this population was ~4,000 animals (N. Shah pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>The fourth largest population is found in Altyn Emel National Park in southeast Kazakhstan. This population was re-established via reintroductions and is currently estimated at ~2,500-3,000 animals (Plakhov <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2012, S.V. Sokolov pers. comm. 2011, R. Habibrakhmanov pers. comm. 2014). Two additional, isolated reintroduced populations are found in Kazakhstan: 1) on Barsa-Kelmes Island with an estimated ~347 animals (Meldebekov <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010) and 2) in Andassay Sanctuary with an estimated ~35 animals (Levanov <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2013). The total population in Kazakhstan is approximately 3,100 animals.<br/><br/>The fifth largest population is found in Qatrouiyeh National Park and the adjacent Bahram-e-Goor protected area in south-central Iran, estimated at 632 (429-939) individuals of which 15% were foals in summer 2014 (M. Hemami pers. comm. 2014). While the Bahram-e-Gour population has shown a positive trend in recent years, the second population in the Touran protected area complex in northern Iran seems to have severely decreased to a mere ~145 animals (summer census 2014 - M. Hemami pers. comm. 2014, Hamidi <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2012). Any potential exchange with the population in adjacent Turkmenistan is inhibited by the fence along the international border. A recent reintroduction resulted in 12 free-ranging animals in Kalmand protected area. The total population in Iran is around 790 animals.<br/><br/>In Turkmenistan Wild Asses only survived in Badkhyz Strictly Protected Area, bordering Iran and Afghanistan. The 2013 estimate for Badkhyz was ~420 individuals (N. Khudaykuliyev pers. comm. 2014), a 50% reduction in the population since the 2008 assessment. Rapid assessments from 2012, 2014 and 2015 suggest that the population may be even lower than 420 individuals (Kuznetsov pers. comm. 2015, Kaczensky and Linnell 2015). From Badkhyz Wild Asses were reintroduced to multiple other localities within Turkmenistan (Pavlov 1996, Lukarevskiy and Gorelov. 2007). The reintroduction to the Sarykamysh reserve was the most successful and the population is estimated at ~300-350 animals, also spreading into adjacent Uzbekistan where another ~50 animals are believed to live (Kuznetsov 2014, N. Marmazinskaja unpubl. data 2012/2013). The other reintroduction sites are all in the south, with an estimated ~100 animals in Meana Chaacha Reserve, ~13 in Western Kopetdag, and ~10-15 in Kuruhaudan (V. Kuznetsov unpubl. data 2012 and 2013). The total population in Turkmenistan and adjacent Uzbekistan is about 920 animals.<br/><br/>The reintroduced population in the Negev in Israel is currently estimated at 250 animals (Gueta <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>Two projects reintroduced Wild Ass populations into large enclosures – so called semi-reserves. The Dzheiran Ecocentre in Uzbekistan is 51 km<sup>2</sup> and houses a population of 98 animals (N. Soldatova unpubl. data 2013) and the Birjutschii peninsula in Ukraine is 100&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;and houses 91 animals (Pavlov 1996, O. Yaremchenko pers. comm. 2014). However, these populations were not included in the IUCN Red List assessment. The planned reintroduction in Taif, Saudi Arabia never happened and no animals remain at the enclosure (Denzau and Denzau 1999, Int. Studbook Of Asiatic Wild Asses - Onager Studbook).<br/><br/>The population trend since the last Red List assessment in 2008 seems more or less stable in Mongolia, is data deficient in China, seems stable or slightly increasing in India, shows a mixed trend in Iran (with Touran dramatically decreasing, but Bahram-e-Goor increasing), is increasing or stable in Kazakhstan,&#160;data deficient&#160;in Turkmenistan (decrease in Badkhyz, but increase in Sarykamysh Reserve), increasing in Uzbekistan from Sarykamysh Reserve, and increasing in Israel.<br/><br/>See Table 1 and Figure 1 in the Supplementary Material.",Stable,"In historic times the Asiatic Wild Ass ranged throughout the steppes and desert steppes of the Russian Federation, Mongolia, northern China, northwest India, Central Asia, the Middle East, including Iran, the Arabian Peninsula and Asia Minor (Bannikov 1981, Heptner <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> </em>1988, Denzau and Denzau 1999). Today the species' main stronghold is southern Mongolia and adjacent China. All other remaining populations are small and largely isolated from each other. One subspecies, the Syrian Wild Ass (<em>E. h. hemippus</em>), became extinct in 1927.<br/> <br/> <em>Equus hemionus</em> may have lost as much as 70% of its range since the 19th century and is now regionally extinct in most of its former range countries primarily due to competition with livestock for pastures and water and severe over-hunting (Bannikov 1981, Feh <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2002). The largest remaining population is found in southern Mongolia (Reading <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2001, Ransom <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012, Norton-Griffiths <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013,Norton-Griffiths&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015) and parts of adjacent China (Q. Cao pers. comm. 2014 based on Bi 2007, Chu 2008). The species also survives as isolated populations in the Little Rann of Kutch in India (Shah and Qureshi 2007), the Badkhyz Reserve in Turkmenistan (Lukarevski and Gorelov 2007) and in the Touran protected area complex and Qatrouiyeh National Park and the adjacent Bahram-e-Goor protected area in Iran (Tatin <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> </em>2003, Hemami and Momeni 2013). <br/> <br/> The species has been re-established via reintroductions in Kazakhstan and Israel. Additional reintroductions have somewhat re-expanded its range in Turkmenistan (also spreading into Uzbekistan) and established two populations in large enclosures in Uzbekistan and Ukraine. The re-established population in Israel is not of the subspecies that originally occurred there, but rather of mixed <em>E. h. kulan</em> and <em>E. h. onager</em> origin (Gueta <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> </em>2014).<p></p>","Illegal trade seems to happen primarily on a national level and stem from poaching for meat, hides and fat, which like liver is believed to have apparent medicinal properties.<br/><br/>Illegal off-take in Mongolia peaked in the early 2000s and also included large scale market hunting (Wingard and Zahler 2006, Stubbe <em>et al.</em> 2007), but currently seems to be much reduced. However, illegal off-take has been identified as a key threat in parts of Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Iran and China and may well drive some of the small populations into extinction if not stopped.",Terrestrial,"The Asiatic Wild Ass is legally protected in all range countries. CITES has listed the subspecies <em>E.h. hemionus</em> (Mongolian Khulan) and <em>E.h. khur</em> (Indian Khur) on Appendix I and all other subspecies on Appendix II since 1975. The full species is listed on Annex A of the EU Wildlife Trade Regulations since 2013. The Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) listed the species on Appendix II in 2002 (UNEP/CMS 2002b). The&#160;Asiatic Wild Ass&#160;is one of the key species in the Central Asian Mammals Initiative (CAMI) of CMS (Karlstetter and Mallon 2014).<br/><br/>In all range countries protected areas have been established with the goal to protect&#160;Asiatic Wild Asses. However, almost all protected areas seem too small to sustain a population year-round or accommodate population recovery. At the fringes of protected areas conflicts with the local population tend to be increasing and/or Asiatic Wild Asses are subject to high levels of illegal killing. Consequently, landscape scale planning and integrative approaches that also take local people’s needs into account are needed for future conservation planning. Unfortunately China just de-gazetted substantial parts of the Kalamaili Nature reserve, a major stronghold of wild asses in Xinjiang, to allow coal mining (Xia <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>On the other hand, Badkhyz Strictly Protected Area in Turkmenistan (M. Day pers. comm. 2014) and the Great Gobi Strictly Protected Area in Mongolia (T. Jaeger pers. comm. 2014) have been listed as possible candidate sites for nomination as UNESCO world heritage sites. For Badkhyz an expansion of the State Nature Reserve, additional adjacent nature reserves and an ecological corridor safeguarding the seasonal migrations of&#160;Asiatic Wild Asses are being currently implemented. A ‘transboundary ecological corridor’ connecting Kalamaili Nature Reserve in Xinjiang province in China, and Great Gobi A and B Strictly Protected Area in Mongolia via the limited entry border area of northern Xinjiang and southern Mongolia has been suggested to re-establish transboundary&#160;Asiatic Wild Ass&#160;movements (Kaczensky <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011a, Xu <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012), but will likely fail without political lobbying.<br/><br/>Although rapid infrastructure development is likely creating one of the biggest challenges for the conservation of migratory and nomadic ungulates, No Net Loss (NNL) or Net Positive Impact (NPI) policies adopted by industry, and newly emerging standards on Biodiversity Offsets (BBOP 2012) are powerful tools that may enable economic development to combine with biodiversity conservation, and offsets may actually provide a more flexible tool to conserve nomadic species (Bull <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013). In Mongolia, the largest mine Oyu Tolgoi is operating on a NPI policy and&#160;Asiatic Wild Asses are a key species of concern.<br/><br/>Reintroductions have re-established the&#160;Asiatic Wild Ass&#160;in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Israel and somewhat expanded its range in Turkmenistan. The reintroduced populations contribute ~8% to the global population, but only managed to reoccupy a tiny fraction of the species former range. New reintroductions are currently discussed in Kazakhstan and Iran. However, care has to be taken that reintroduction projects do not distract attention and funds from conserving the remaining autochthonous populations.<br/><br/>Whereas increasing monitoring and research efforts are made in Mongolia, Israel, Xinjiang province in China, India and Bahram-e-Goor in Iran, little systematic information is available from Inner Mongolia and Gansu province in China, Touran protected area complex in Iran, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Furthermore, major research gaps exist regarding: i) the human dimension of&#160;Asiatic Wild Ass&#160;management and conservation, ii) site specific population dynamics parameters, iii) triggers, drivers, and scale of nomadic or seasonal movements, iv) impact and mitigation of barriers.<br/><br/>A Programme of Work for the CMS Central Asian Mammal Initiative (CAMI) was agreed during the Stakeholder Meeting on the Conservation of Large Mammals in Central Asia, Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan (2325 September 2014) and included a recommendation to develop a single-species action plan for the Asiatic Wild Ass as a high priority.",Palearctic,,false,false,Global

A suspected population decline caused by significant and accelerating rates of deforestation is projected to continue and perhaps accelerate. Combined with the facts that more than 90% of the population is believed to occur outside of protected areas, and the species continues to be hunted for food and medicinal purposes, a population loss equalling or exceeding 50% can be anticipated over three generations (between the years 2000 and 2045).<br/></p>","<p>This gibbon is a forest-dweller that inhabits primary evergreen, scrub and semi-deciduous hill forest, as well as mountainous broadleaf forest, but it cannot survive in pine-dominated forest. It ranges up to 2,700 m in elevation in Mt.&#160;Gaoligong&#160;(P.-F. Fan <em>et al</em>. 2013). The annual mean temperature is 13.3&#160;°C and 13.1°C&#160;at two sites of Mt.&#160;Gaoligong.&#160;Gibbon habitat can be covered by snow in cold winters.<br/> <br/> Two habituated groups are well studied by Fan Peng-Fei. and his team. Annual diet of a group in Mt.&#160;Gaoligong&#160;comprised 49.1% fruit (non-fig fruit 35.6%and fig 13.5%), 43.3% leaves (buds, young and mature leaves), 5.3% invertebrates and bird chicks, 1.8% flowers, and 0.6% others. Individuals prefer ripe fruits when they are available. They shift their diet to leaves and buds and&#160; increased feeding time when fruits and figs are not available (P.-F. Fan <em>et al</em>. 2013). Groups use large home ranges (93 and 178 ha for two groups), and use different sections monthly (P.-F. Fan <em>et al</em>., 2017; Zhang <em>et al</em>., 2014). Their daily travel distance varied from month to month (group&#160;BB: mean&#160;=&#160;1,308 ± SD 735 m, range&#160;=&#160;272–3,705 m, N = 60 days; group NA: mean&#160;=&#160;1126 ± SD 488 m, range&#160;=&#160;345–2,606 m, N = 52 days (P.-F. Fan <em>et al</em>. 2017), mostly depends on their diet and food availability. They decrease travel distance when they eat more leaves (Zhang <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Adults live in pairs and coordinate their singing to produce duet bouts that lasted for an average 25.5 min. Paired adults never produce solo bouts unless they are separated by human disturbances. The singing rate (number of bouts/number of monitoring days) of four groups in Mt.&#160;Gaoligong&#160;range from 7.5% to 31.4% which was lower than other gibbon populations, presumably due to low group density and prevalence of hunting at the study site (Yin <em>et al.</em>, 2016).&#160;&#160;One group stop calling for 68 days after at least 30 gunshots were heard from its home range.<br/><br/>Like other gibbons, Skywalker Hoolock Gibbons sleep in tall trees, and rarely use the same tree on consecutive days. They travel very fast to enter sleeping trees 2-3 hours before sunset. They mostly sleep on branches of diameter less than 10 cm and close to tree tops. Anti-predation is an important factor that affects Skywalker Hoolock Gibbon’s sleeping behavior (P.-F. Fan <em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).<br/><br/>Neighbouring groups rarely fight along territory borders. Only one inter-group conflict was recorded in four years (Yin <em>et al</em>. 2016).</p>","<p>In China, although commercial logging has been banned, <em>Hoolock tinxiang</em> is threatened by small-scale habitat loss, degradation, fragmentation, and hunting (Fan <em>et al</em>. 2011, Yin <em>et al</em>. 2016). Local people believe that the brain of&#160;hoolock&#160;gibbons can be used to cure epilepsy. Nearly half of the remnant population now live in agro-forestry complexes (e.g., cardamom cultivation)<em></em>. Although cardamom cultivation causes some negative effects on gibbons, these agro-forestry complexes provide important gibbon habitat provided they are not too fragmented and hunting is prohibited (Zhang <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>In Myanmar, <em>H. tinxiang</em> remains threatened by habitat loss due largely to slash-and-burn agriculture, gold mining and logging, and secondarily by hunting for food and medicinal purposes (Ni <em>et al</em>. 2018).&#160; Unfortunately, the species is not known to occur in any protected areas in this country.&#160; According to the most recent Global Forest Watch (2019) data for Myanmar, the six administrative divisions in which <em>H. tinxiang</em> is believed to occur - Shan, Mandalay, Kayah, Bago, Kayan and Mon - have lost nearly 9% of their forest cover since 2000, are collectively losing forest at a rate above the national average, and that rate has accelerated significantly in recent years. The previous gibbon generation (2000–2015) could have been expected to decline at a corresponding rate, and the present generation (2016–2030) and subsequent generation (2031–2045) can be expected to decline at a corresponding rate as well - this would result in a population decline related to habitat loss of at least 30%.&#160; Should the current rate of loss continue to accelerate, which it appears to be doing, and hunting continue as well, a decline in population approaching or exceeding 50% can easily be anticipated.<br/></p><p>  </p><p></p>","<p>In China, the population is estimated to be approximately 200 individuals in nine (9) subpopulations<em></em> (Fan <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>In Myanmar, population estimates have ranged between 10,000 and 50,000 individuals (Geissmann <em>et al.</em> 2013). Even at the lower end of that range, the Myanmar population would represent at least 98% of the species' total.<br/><br/>Based on deforestation data for Myanmar since 2000, the region inhabited by this species has already experienced a significant and accelerating loss of forest. It is not known to occur in any protected areas of that country. Continued deforestation over the current and subsequent generation (2019 to 2045), combined with hunting for food and medicinal purposes) could plausibly result in a population reduction exceeding 50%.<br/></p>",Decreasing,"<p>In Myanmar, this species is found between the Irrawaddy-Nmai&#160;Hka&#160;River and the Salween River (P.-F. Fan <em>et al</em>. 2017). In China, wild individuals are confirmed to occur on Mt. Gaoligong. Historical museum specimens are also known from further south at Gokteik, Shan States, northern Myanmar (P.-F. Fan <em>et al</em>. 2017).</p>","<p>In Myanmar, commercial logging is ongoing, and hunting is serious problem. Nearly every year, a few small juveniles and infants of&#160;hoolock&#160;gibbons (mostly&#160;<em>H.&#160;leuconedys</em>) are&#160;illegally&#160;exported to China (Ni <em>et al.</em>, 2018).</p>",Terrestrial,"<p>Half of the remnant Chinese population of <em>Hoolock tinxiang</em>&#160; occurs in the Gaoligong&#160;National Nature Reserve (P.-F.

Cloud Mountain Conservation educate local residents, especially school children, around Skywalker Hoolock Gibbon habitat, and support reserves to increase patrol.<br/><br/>Although a number of wildlife sanctuaries can be found within the range of <em>Hoolock tinxiang</em> in Myanmar, none are reported to harbor this species.&#160;</p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

This is compounded by the likelihood that governance and law enforcement changes on a level needed to prevent the overexploitation of the species are unlikely to occur within two or arguably three generations time, that derivatives of this species are used in traditional medicine in China, both legally and illegally, and being promoted as a means of economic growth in the country and along the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) which could increase demand for the species and its parts, and there is currently weak evidence that demand reduction efforts in key consumer countries for Asian pangolin products and derivatives are effective, which theoretically could lead to a reduction in harvest.<br/><strong></strong><em></em><u></u><sub></sub><sup></sup><br/>Currently, only Hong Kong and Taiwan, and potentially Bhutan, are parts of the range where overexploitation is not thought to be a threat to the species.","<p>This species is found in a wide range of habitats, including primary and secondary tropical forests, limestone, bamboo, broad-leaf and coniferous forests, grasslands and agricultural fields (Chao 1989, Gurung 1996). The species digs its own burrows, or enlarges passages made by termites (Wu <em>et al.</em> 2005. Newton <em>et al.</em> 2008). Mro hunters in Bangladesh reported that a pangolin can excavate up to 15 burrows in a single night (presumably feeding burrows) and that resident burrows can extend up to 10m deep (Trageser <em>et al.</em> 2017). This study also revealed that like the Indian Pangolin, the Chinese Pangolin will create an earthen wall once in a resident burrow which likely aids in predator avoidance (Trageser <em>et al.</em> 2017). Indications are that home ranges are relatively large. In Taitung, Taiwan, the home range of a male was estimated 96.0 ha (100% MCP) or 66.6 ha (90% Fixed Kernel; n = 1) and 14.3-30.3 ha (100% MCP) or 15.9~19.6 ha (90% Fixed Kernel) for females (n = 6) (Lin, 2011) </p>  <p>The Chinese Pangolin is solitary, primarily nocturnal (sometimes crepuscular), and largely terrestrial although it is fully capable of climbing trees and, like other pangolins, swims well (Heath and Vanderlip 1988; Chao 1989). Little is known about the species' life history, although in China (including Taiwan [Province of China]), young (normally one and occasionally two) are reportedly born from August to February (Allen and Coolidge 1940, Liu and Xu 1981, Shi and Wang 1985, Chao 1989, Chao <em>et al.</em> 1993, Chin<em> et al.</em> 2011). Hunters in Viet Nam reported that they never find this species in trees and it seems likely that it is far more terrestrial than the more arboreal Sunda Pangolin (see Newton <em>et al.</em> 2008).</p>  <p>Lin (2011) reported that there are two type of burrows that Chinese Pangolin use, namely feeding burrows and resident burrows. Feeding burrows are created by feeding on subterranean termites and are mainly used once. Lin found no statistically significant difference between the frequency of forest and more open habitats. Resident burrows are used for shelter and resting and sleep. A male pangolin can occupy ~80 resident burrows in its home range and a female has ~30-40 resident burrows. Different individuals may use the same resting burrow but very rarely on the same day.</p>  <p>Sun <em>et al</em>. (2018) reported the nursing period of the wild Chinese Pangolin was 157 days. The infant pangolin was observed exiting the nursing burrow alone at 11 weeks old and exploring behaviors such as s soil scraping and licking were recorded. In addition, the exploring behaviours were observe while the mother had left the burrow. The growth rate of was estimated at a constant rate of 1.2 cm/week during the nursing period, which was much faster than the only record from a hand-reared individual (0.7 cm/week; see Sun <em>et al.</em> 2018).</p>  <p>The diet consists of ants and termites and it has been noted that in China, there appears to be a close correlation between the Chinese Pangolin's distribution and that of two termite species (<em>Coptotermes formosanus</em> and <em>Termes</em> (<em>Cyclotermes</em>) <em>formosanus</em>) which are assumed to form a major component of the diet (Allen and Coolidge 1940). Individuals are prey selective but known prey species include <em>Anoplolepis gracilipes, Camponotus mitis, C. nicobarensis, C. variegatus dulcis, Polyrhachis demangei, Aphaenogaster exasperata, Crematogaster dohrni</em>, and termite species <em>Macrotermes barneyi</em> : this is based on analysis of stomach contents (see Lee <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p>  <p><br/></p>","The primary threat is indiscriminate hunting and poaching, both targeted and untargeted, for local and international use, with the latter primarily driven by demand in China, and the species is subject to very heavy collection pressure across much of its range (Wu and Ma 2007, Newton <em>et al.</em> 2008, Thapa 2013, Challender <em>et al.</em> 2015, Nash <em>et al.</em> 2016, Trageser <em>et al. </em>2017, D'Cruze <em>et al.</em> 2018). As has occurred historically, exploitation for nutritional, medicinal and spiritualistic purposes takes place locally (Anon 1999, Nash <em>et al.</em> 2016, Trageser <em>et al.</em> 2017, D'Cruze et al. 2018). However, evidence suggests that local use is now frequently forgone in favour of entering animals into national and international trade given their high financial value (Newton <em>et al.</em> 2008, Thapa 2013, MacMillan and Nguyen 2014). International use involves trafficking of the species and its derivatives despite the species being included in Appendix I of CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. Challender <em>et al.</em> (2015) estimated that between 2000 and 2013 international trafficking in this species potentially involved ~50,000 individuals, though the actual number between 2000 and 2018 is higher (see Challender <em>et al.</em> 2019). In China and Viet Nam, the meat is consumed conspicuously as a luxury wild meat for which affluent consumers are willing to pay high prices (Shairp <em>et al.</em> 2016). This species also appears in both Chinese and Vietnamese traditional medicinal literature&#160;which prescribes the use of scales in traditional medicines to treat skin conditions, improve blood circulation and to stimulate milk secretion in lactating women (e.g., Chinese Pharmacopeia Commission, 2015). In China, pangolin scales also appear to be prescribed for these and other ailments, and cancer (Yu and Hong 2018), through designated outlets such as hospitals, but also through traditional medicine retailers. Since 2009 the Chinese government has released an average of 26.6 tonnes of pangolin scales from (presumably) government stockpiles on to a legal market for scales in the county (CBCGDF 2016), and which are certified through a certification system. However, this mechanism is undermined by ongoing illegal trade and availability of scales in traditional medicines shops in China (Xu <em style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"">et al.</em> 2016). Ongoing but illicit availability is also the case in Viet Nam (Challender <em style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"">et al.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>Other threats include infrastructure development, habitat loss and fragmentation, and pesticide use. In China, major developments including hydropower stations and mining also pose a threat.<br/>Taiwan and Hong Kong are exceptions where populations are not threatened by heavy hunting or poaching. The threats here include predation by feral dogs, roadkill and development, i.e. conversion of land for human use. In Taiwan, research suggests that Chinese Pangolins can become trapped in burrows or tree hollows, and is a cause of mortality, as is their capture in gin traps (Sun<em> et al.</em> 2019).<strong></strong><em></em>","<p>There is very little information available on population levels at any level (local, national or global) with few exceptions, and there is a paucity of research on abundance. This species is rarely observed, principally due to its increasing rarity, but also because it is secretive, solitary and primarily nocturnal. Evidence indicates it has been extirpated from parts of its current range as a result of over-exploitation, and is otherwise in steep decline across most of its range (Zhang 2008, Nash <em>et al.</em> 2016, Trageser <em>et al</em>. 2017). An exception is Taiwan where populations are suspected to be stable and potentially increasing.&#160;</p><p>China comprises the largest range state for this species, but populations have suffered severe declines in recent decades. Between the 1960-1980s up to 160,000 Chinese Pangolins were harvested annually in China for consumptive use resulting in all but the commercial extinction of the species by the 1990s (SATCM 1996, Zhang 2008). We <em>et al.</em> (2004) estimated that populations declined by 88-94% between the 1960s and 1990s. In 2002, Wu <em>et al.</em> (2002) estimated populations in China to comprise 50,000-100,000 individuals, and in 2008 China’s then National Forestry Administration (NFA; though now National Forestry and Grassland Administration [NFGA]) estimated the national population to comprise 64,000 individuals. In contrast, Zhang<em> et al.</em> (2010) estimated the population in China in 2008 to comprise between 25,100 and 49,450 individuals. Also in 2008, the NFA (2008) estimated the population of Guangxi Province at 990 individuals with a density of 0.043 individuals/km². Interviews as part of research in China in recent years indicate this species is present but very rare in the border areas of Guangxi and Yunnan provinces (P.L.B. Chan, unpubl. data), but at some sites (e.g., Dawuling Natural Reserve and Luofushan Natural Reserve), new burrows have not been seen in approaching twenty years indicating extirpation, and it is suspected that the species has been extirpated from Jiangsu, Henan and Shanghai Provinces (Wu <em>et al.</em> 2005, Zhang <em>et al.</em> 2010). Between 2015 and 2016, more than 20 natural reserves were surveyed in southern China, but found no fresh burrows or live individuals (F. Zhang and Q. Wang, unpubl. data). Li et al. (2018) estimated that in eastern China (Fujian, Jiangxi and Zhejiang Provinces) the species’ range contracted by 52% between 1970s and 2000s, and populations are now largely confined to the Wuyi Mountains. On Hainan Island, extensive field research between 1997 and 2013 and interviews with hunters and local people indicate the species is of very low abundance and likely commercially extinct (Nash <em>et al. </em>2016, P.L.B. Chan, unpubl. data). In Hong Kong SAR, the species is present but is considered rare (G. Ades, pers. comm).<br/></p><p>In Taiwan (P.R. China) reports from the late 1980s and early 1990s suggest that populations of the nominal subspecies, the Formosan Pangolin were decreasing due to overexploitation from hunting and populations are were greatly reduced (Chao&#160; 1989, Chao <em>et al. </em>2005). After the Taiwanese government established the Wildlife Conservation Act in 1989 it appears that domestic consumption was significantly reduced. Evidence suggests populations are stable if not increasing in Taiwan and poaching is no longer the main threat. In southern Taiwan Pei (2010) estimated densities of 12-13 individuals/km². Kao <em>et al.</em> (2019) estimated very approximately that the meta-population in Taiwan may comprise 15,000 individuals - though this estimate should be treated with extreme caution given significant knowledge gaps in parameters used to inform the models used to produce this estimate.</p><p>The species is very rare in Viet Nam. There are records from the past three decades from various protected areas, including Ba Na NP (Frontier Viet Nam, 1994), Cuc Phuong NP, Khe Net Nature Reserve and in Ke Go Nature Reserve (see Newton<em> et al.</em> 2008). However, hunters in three areas of Viet Nam reported that although they still find the Chinese Pangolin it is extremely rare and populations have declined dramatically in the last two decades (i.e. in the 1990s and 2000s; see Newton <em>et al. </em>2008). In Khe Net and Ke Go, hunters reported that numbers of Chinese Pangolins were lower than those of the Sunda Pangolin probably because the former is easier to capture. If this is the case, then in places where both species occur, populations of the former are likely to be more heavily depleted (Newton<em> et al.</em> 2008).</p><p>The species has been so heavily hunted in Lao PDR that field sightings are exceptionally rare. There were field sightings of an individual in Nam Theun Extension PNBCA (Proposed National Biodiversity Conservation Area) in 1994-1995, and an individual was seen in a village in Nakai-Nam Theun NBCA during the same period (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999). There are unverified camera trap records from Nakai-Nam Theun NBCA in the early 2010s (Coudrat, 2017).<br/></p>  <p>In Bangladesh, Chinese Pangolins in the southeast may have disappeared (Trageser <em>et al.</em> 2017), however, there are still a few areas where they exist, such as within the Chittagong Hill Tracts where there is an absence of high-skilled hunters (Trageser <em>et al. </em>2017). In this area, there was consensus among hunters interviewed that populations in the south has been extirpated as a result of overexploitation from poaching since 2014 (Trageser <em>et al.</em> 2017). Populations in Bangladesh are suspected to be declining.</p>  <p>This species was reported in the 1980s as common in the undisturbed hill forests of Arunachal Pradesh, however, little is known about the total population in India (Tikader 1983, Zoological Survey of India 1994). However, trafficking figures suggest this species is under severe hunting pressure in Northeast India (Misra and Hanfee 2000, Mohapatra <em>et al.</em> 2015, D'Cruze <em>et al.</em> 2018).<br/></p><p>Surveys conducted in the Royal Nagarjung Forest in Kathmandu, Nepal, in the early 1990s determined that there was a healthy population there (Gurung 1996). Nepal's population has been loosely estimated at 5,000 individuals but is suspected to be declining as a result of overexploitation (Jnawali <em>et al.</em> 2011).</p><p>There is little information on the status of the species in Thailand and Myanmar. There is a potential record from Hkakaborazi NP in northern Myanmar form post-2000 (Rao <em>et al.</em> 2005).<br/></p>",Decreasing,"<p>This species occurs in the Himalayan foothills of Nepal, southern Bhutan, north and northeastern India, northeast, northwest and southeastern Bangladesh, northern and western Myanmar, to northern and Annamite regions of Lao PDR and northern Viet Nam, part of northwestern Thailand, and across southern China. In China it occurs south of the Changjiang (Yangtze River) and on Hainan, Taiwan (P.R. China) and Hong Kong SAR. The species has likely been extirpated from parts of its current range, the limits of which are poorly known and may never be elucidated, due to high levels of exploitation historically. However, Taiwanese pangolin populations have stabilized in the last two decades and may even be increasing. The species occurs at high altitudes, especially in the southern and western parts of its range. In Nepal it has been recorded up to 3,000 m asl (A. Khatiwada, unpubl. data), though also occurs at much lower altitudes, for example in Hong Kong and likely in the northeast of its range. Its latitudinal range is thought to overlap considerably with that of the Sunda Pangolin <em>Manis javanica</em>. Where this is apparent it is hypothesized that the Chinese Pangolin occurs in hills and mountains and the former is more generally found at lower altitudes (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1999). In Viet Nam interviews with hunters in 2007 (see Newton <em>et al.</em> 2008) suggested that the two species can be found in the same areas of forest, and that the differences between them are ecological, relating to diet and habitat use, rather than altitude, but ecological differences between the species have yet to be fully elucidated. <strong></strong><em></em><u></u><sub></sub><sup></sup><br/></p>  <p>In China the species' distribution extends from the southern border as far north as the Changjiang, including on the island of Zhoushan at the mouth of the Changjiang (Allen and Coolidge 1940). Its distribution extends to the provinces of Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangdong, Huibei, Chongqing, Shanghai, and Fujian, and in the Autonomous Regions of Guangxi Zhuang, Tibet, and Hainan Island. Zhai (2000) suggest the species occurs in Xichuan county of Henan province, which would be the only record north of the Changjiang, but they provide little detail and this requires verification. In Hong Kong, the species has been recorded from the central and northeast New Territories and Lantau Island, but not on the smaller outlying islands (Shek <em>et al.</em> 2007); it occurs here at low altitudes (Reels 1996). In Taiwan (P.R. China), the species occurs on the periphery of the Central Mountain Range, the Western Foothill Range, the Taoyuan Tableland, the Ouluanpi Tableland, the East Coast Mountain Range, the Tatun Volcano Group, Taipei Basin, Puli Basin, and the Pingtun Plain (Chao 1989, Chao <em>et al</em>. 2005). The upper limit of occurrence in Taiwan is around 2,000 m asl (Chao 1989).</p><p>Beyond China, the species is distributed in northern and central Vietnam, from Ha Giang province as far south as Quang Tri Province, but is absent from the northeast coast (Newton <em>et al.</em> 2008). The species is found in Cuc Phuong National Park, Khe Net Nature Reserve, and Ke Go Nature Reserve, and Ba Na National Park (Newton<em> et al.</em> 2008). In Lao PDR, the species has been recorded in the north and central parts, but there are too few locality records to determine the geographic and altitudinal range of the species in the country with any accuracy (Timmins and Evans 1996; Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999). The species is plausibly widespread in northern Myanmar, although there are few records and its exact distribution is not well known (Salter 1983, Corbet and Hill 1992). There is a record from Karen State in the early 2010s (Moo <em>et al.</em> 2017). Rao <em>et al.</em> (2005) report a sighting of the Sunda Pangolin in Hkakaborazi NP in northern Myanmar, but there is uncertainty over the species' identification (M. Rao, pers. comm.) and it is plausibly and perhaps more likely the Chinese pangolin. There are few records from Thailand but include those from Doi Inthanon (formerly Doi Angka) in Changwat, Chiang Mai (northern Thailand), sometime in 1937 and 1939 (Allen and Coolidge 1940) and Doi Sutep, Chiangmai (northern Thailand) in 1901.</p>  <p>In Bangladesh, the species occurs in northern, northeastern and southeastern parts of the country, including in the border areas with northwestern Myanmar and India’s Assam, Meghalaya and Mizoram states. Two Chinese Pangolins were captured from northwestern Bangladesh in recent years but which is thought to be the result of flash flooding from India. The species has reportedly been extirpated from most protected areas in southeastern Bangladesh. However, it does occur in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (southeast), Lawachara National Park and adjacent protected areas (northeast), and Thakurgao (northwest) but has been extirpated from some areas due to poaching since around 2014 (Trageser <em>et al.</em> 2017). In northern Bangladesh, it may be restricted to the India-Bangladesh border area only (Trageser<em> et al.</em> 2017).<br/></p>  <p>The species is marginally present in northern India e.g. Vamiki Tiger Reserve, Bihar (Maurya <em>et al.</em> 2018). There are photographic records of the species in Bihar and it has been recorded in northeastern India (Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Tripura, Mizoram, Sikkim and the northern part of West Bengal) (Tikader 1983, Zoological Society of India 2002, Srinivasulu and Srinivasulu 2012). Chinese Pangolins also exist in Kaziranga-Karbi-Anglong landscape and Manas-Bhutan landscape and there are recent (post-2015) camera trap records from Manas National Park, India (D. Lahkar, unpubl. data), and reports of the species being present near Sirohi Wildlife Sanctuary, Bunning Wildlife Sanctuary and Yangoupokpi-Lokchao Wildlife Sanctuary of Manipur, India (J. Sethy, unpubl. data). The species appears to be sympatric with the Indian Pangolin (<em>M. crassicaudata</em>)<em> </em>in the Neora Valley National Park (Mallick 2010) and Manas National Park (Lahkhar <em>et al.</em> 2018; Goswami and Ganesh 2014).</p>  <p>The species occurs in southern Bhutan (though potentially central and western areas only) and Nepal, where it is typically located between 555-1740 m Asl, though there are records from 3000m Asl (A. Khatiwada, unpubl. data). A nation-wide survey of pangolins (see DNPWC and DOF 2018) in Nepal unveiled the occurrence of Chinese Pangolin throughout Nepal largely distributed in human dominated landscapes outside the protected areas, though it does occur in protected areas as well. This suggests that Chinese Pangolins are distributed across eastern, central and mid-western Nepal and the Mid hills of central Nepal harbors likely strongholds for the species. It has been recorded as present in the lower elevation belt of the Kangchenjunga Conservation Area, the Gaurishankar and Annapurna Conservation Areas, Makalubarun, Sagarmatha, Chitwan, Parsa and Shivapuri-Nagarjun National Parks, the Salyan district in western Nepal (Khatiwada <em>et al.</em> 2019).&#160; It has been also recorded in the Suklaphanta NP in southwest Nepal within the last four years and in Jajarkot district in mid-west Nepal (H.S. Baral, unpubl. data). In Nepal, its distribution appears to overlap with the Indian pangolin in the south and west. The Chinese Pangolin occurs from Inner Terai to hills and mountains while the Indian Pangolin is confined to lower altitudes; however, ecological differences between are not fully understood. &#160;</p>  <strong></strong><em></em><u></u><sub></sub><sup></sup>","<p>This species has been hunted at a local level historically, both for the consumption of its meat as a protein source, and for its scales for use as an ingredient in traditional medicines among other spiritual and ritualistic uses (Anon 1992, Zhang 2008, Wu and Ma 2007). It has also been subject to international trade historically. Based on trade data from CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, this has principally involved scales&#160;or traditional medicines containing scales, as well as skins between the 1970s and the year 2000 (Challender <em>et al.</em> 2015; Heinrich <em>et al. </em>2016). However, following population declines in China up to the mid-1990s (see Zhang 2008), a heavy unrecorded and seemingly illicit international trade in live pangolins has occurred between Southeast Asia and China since which has involved this species (Li and Li 1998,&#160;Newton <em>et al.</em> 2008, Wu and Ma 2007). In the year 2000, CITES introduced zero export quotas for wild-caught specimens of this species traded for commercial purposes. Despite this, illegal trade has continued post-2000 which is largely driven by market demand in China and mainly involves live animals and scales originating from Southeast and South Asia based on available evidence (Wu and Ma 2007, Challender and Waterman, 2017). Trade in this species in particular appears to come from Myanmar (Challender and Waterman 2017). Although local use of pangolins also continues today, evidence suggests that this is often forgone in favour of selling the animals into trade, which is primarily destined to China (Newton <em>et al.</em> 2008).&#160; </p>  <p>In China, as well as Viet Nam, pangolin meat is consumed conspicuously as a luxury wild meat dish for which affluent consumers are willing to pay very high prices (Shairp <em>et al.</em> 2016). This species also appears in both Chinese and Vietnamese traditional medicinal literature&#160;which prescribes the use of scales in medicines to treat skin conditions, improve blood circulation and to stimulate milk secretion in lactating women (Chinese Pharmacopeia Commission 2015). In China, pangolin scales also appear to be prescribed for these and other ailments, and cancer (Yu and Hong 2018), through designated outlets such as hospitals, but also through traditional medicine retailers, as in Viet Nam. Since 2009 the Chinese government has released an average of 26.6 tonnes of pangolin scales from (presumably) government stockpiles on to a legal market for scales in the county (CBCGDF 2016), and which are certified through a certification system. However, this mechanism is undermined by ongoing illegal trade and availability of scales in traditional medicines shops in China (Xu <em>et al.</em> 2016). Ongoing but illicit availability is also the case in Viet Nam (Challender <em>et al.</em> 2015).</p><p>Other consumer countries include the United States which imported large quantities of derivatives including the Chinese Pangolin between 1985 and 20111 based on CITES trade data (Challender and Waterman 2017).</p><p>There is ongoing local use across the species' range though quantifying this across the species' range is challenging. In Bangladesh, tribal communities believe that the use of pangolin meat can reduce their illness and the scales can keep away evil spirits. Local physicians also sell the scales by promoting their supposed supernatural medicine value, occasionally in cities. Trade routes exist between Bangladesh and Myanmar and pangolins are trafficked along these routes, mainly destined to China. In Sindhupalchowk district of Nepal, scales are worshipped as an incarnation of God during Tihar festival and are kept in homes to avoid evil spirits (P. Kaspal, unpubl. data). In Nepal, jhakris, local traditional healers have been using the pangolin for its supposed medicinal benefits for generations, but it is only recently that a booming trade has developed around the species which is threatening the specie. The species continues to be exploited locally for consumptive use in China (Nash <em>et al.</em> 2016), Viet Nam (Newton <em>et al.</em> 2008), Bangladesh (Trageser <em>et al.</em> 2017), northeastern India (D'Cruze <em>et al.</em> 2018) and Nepal&#160;</p>",Terrestrial,"<p>The species is present in a number of protected areas across its range including in Bangladesh:&#160;Chittagong Hill Tracts, Lawachara National Park and adjacent protected areas (Trageser <em>et al.</em> 2017); China: Dawuling Natural Reserve; India: Vamiki Tiger Reserve (Maurya <em>et al.</em> 2018), Manas National Park (D.

Additional interventions are also needed including efforts to reduce demand for pangolin products among consumers in key markets and ensure local community buy-in to conservation efforts within and around key sites. &#160;</p>  <p>Research is required into the population status of this species, including population parameters and its ability to withstand current and projected hunting and poaching pressures.

Cliffs, hills or large trees are necessary night-time retreats. In some habitats, such as in the Namib Desert, habitat choice is influenced by predation risk. This species is totally dependent on drinking daily, and water availability limits its overall range in Namibia. However, one troop in the Kuiseb Canyon, Namib Desert, balanced its water requirements with moisture from nearby plants and conserved water by resting and sleeping during the hottest part of the day. Through this adaptation to their arid environment they temporarily overcame restrictions imposed by the need for regular drinking and were observed to survive without water for up to 11 days and even longer. In dry localities, artificial water supplies have allowed substantial expansion of territory. This species is an opportunistic omnivore and shows a local preference for bulbs, shoots, roots, seeds or fruits. Invertebrates, small vertebrates, seashore life, fungi and lichen are eaten as and when available. Occasionally, they take small antelopes or the young of species like Impala <em>Aepyceros melampus</em>. Crops (maize, tomatoes, citrus and root crops) are raided in settled areas. Lambs and small stock are taken in some ranching areas. They are also known to predate on smaller monkeys.&#160;</p>  <p>Troops average between 20 and 50 animals, but may total up to 130 individuals. Multi-male hierarchies are normal, though smaller troops may only have a single male (in one study in the Drakensberg, one-male groups made up 50% of groups recorded above 2,100 m).</p>  <p>&#160;</p>","There are no major threats to this species, although problem animals may be shot as vermin. Local population extinctions are known from many farming areas. With changes in land use, populations are also becoming increasingly fragmented. Animals are also hunted and body parts of dead baboons are offered for sale in markets in South Africa for traditional medicinal use, but this is not considered a major threat.",This species is common and widespread.
