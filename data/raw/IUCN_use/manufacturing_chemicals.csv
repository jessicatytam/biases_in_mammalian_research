160983555,41755,Physeter macrocephalus,Vulnerable,A1d,2019,2008-06-30 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The cause of the population reduction in this species (commercial whaling) is reversible, understood, and is not currently in operation. For this reason, the species is assessed under criterion A1, not under A2, A3 or A4. <em>Physeter macrocephalus</em> is globally widespread (thus not qualifying as threatened under criterion B), and does not have a global population that warrants listing under criteria C-D. Empirical trend data for this species globally are unavailable. However, commercial whaling at a large scale for this species in the North Pacific and Antarctic within the last three generations (82 years) certainly resulted in a global decline during this period. Commercial whaling for this species has ceased and therefore this population is evaluated under the A1 criterion rather than under the A2-4 criteria. A peer-reviewed publication (Whitehead 2002) provides a model-based estimate of global trend that can be used to evaluate the population under the A1 criterion. The results from that study gave a 6% probability for Endangered, a 54% probability of meeting the Vulnerable category, and a 40% probability of falling into the Near Threatened category. The results suggest little chance that the population would meet the criteria for Endangered or for Least Concern. There is credible and realistic evidence for either the Vulnerable or Near Threatened category. Given that the results give greater probability for at least the Vulnerable category (60%), and that this is the more precautionary category, the species is classified as Vulnerable.","The habitat of the Sperm Whale is the open sea. More specifically, Sperm Whales can be found in almost all marine waters deeper than 1,000 m that are not covered by ice, except in the Black Sea and possibly the Red Sea (Rice 1989; Whitehead 2003). In some areas, particularly in the western North Atlantic, sperm whales, especially males, can occur in shallower waters (e.g., Scott and Sadove 1997). Females and young are usually restricted to waters at latitudes lower than about 40-50º and to areas where sea surface temperatures are greater than about 15ºC (Rice 1989). Sperm Whales are generally more numerous in areas of relatively high primary productivity (Jaquet <em>et al</em>. 1996), although there are some exceptions, such as the Sargasso Sea and the central North Pacific gyre (Barlow and Taylor 2005).<br/><br/>The Sperm Whale is an animal of extremes in size (up to 18 m), sexual dimorphism (mature males have three times the mass of mature females), ecological imprint (sperm whales take roughly the same amount of biomass from the oceans as humans), and many other attributes (Whitehead 2003). The commercial value of the animal (a function of its size and the quality of Sperm Whale oil) drove two massive worldwide hunts: the technologically primitive “open-boat” hunt from 1712-~1920 (Starbuck 1878; Best 1983), and modern whaling using engine-driven whaling ships and harpoon guns from ~1910-1988 (Tonnessen and Johnsen 1982). The complex social structure of sperm whales may have been affected by whaling, lowering potential population growth rates, which are very low anyway (Whitehead 2003). On the positive side, Sperm Whales are very widely distributed (see above), and their primary prey, deep-water squid, are not yet major targets of fisheries.<br/><br/>The generation time (mean age of mothers) for Sperm Whales can be calculated if one assumes a set of population parameters, specifically age at first birth, mortality rate of mature females, and reproductive rate of mature females. There is uncertainty about these parameters, so two calculations were made using different assumptions:<br/><br/>a) Applying the population parameters most recently used for Sperm Whales by the International Whaling Commission’s Scientific Committee (International Whaling Commission 1982): age at first birth = 10 years; female reproductive rate in unexploited population = 0.20/year; female adult mortality = 0.055/yr): generation time = 27.3 years.<br/><br/>b) The estimates of mortality used by the International Whaling Commission are particularly problematic, and Sperm Whales likely have age-specific survival and reproductive rates. Thus it may be more realistic (Whitehead 2002) to use the well-established mortality schedule of Killer Whales (<em>Orcinus orca</em>; Olesiuk <em>et al</em>. 1990) and an age-specific pregnancy rate taken from the sperm whale data presented by Best <em>et al</em>. (1984; pregnancy rate for mature females = 0.257-0.0038xAge in years): generation time = 27.5","The greatest threat to Sperm Whales, extensive commercial whaling, has ceased. However, a number of other threats of various dimensions remain.<br/><br/>Sperm Whales have had a long history of local whaling going back at least to the 1500s and intense commercial whaling beginning around 1712 and continuing to 1988. The “modern” highly mechanised phase was particularly intense around 1950, and at its peak killed around 25,000 whales per year, dramatically depleting the global population. In recent decades, some tens of whales were taken each year from small boats in Indonesia (Reeves 2002), although none have been taken in the last two years (H. Whitehead pers. comm.), and 10 are taken annually by Japan under IWC Special Permit (Clapham <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>Entanglement in fishing gear, particularly gillnets, has been a particular problem in the Mediterranean Sea (Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara, 2006), but Sperm Whales die from entanglement in nets and lines in many other areas and in a variety of fisheries as well (e.g., Haase and Félix 1994; Barlow and Cameron 2003). Considering the widespread distribution of Sperm Whales, observations of occasional takes in relatively small scale gillnet fisheries (e.g. Barlow and Cameron 2003) suggest much larger takes in unobserved, unregulated high seas driftnet fisheries such as were common before the 1989 adoption of resolution 44/225 of the UN General Assembly. <br/><br/>Sperm Whales sometimes take fish off fishing gear (most often demersal long-line gear), an activity known as “depredation.” Depredation of long-line catches appears to be a recent and increasing phenomenon, and now occurs in many regions (e.g., South East Alaska, Chile, South Georgia and several other southern ocean island areas, North Atlantic). This interaction has resulted in a few reported entanglements and deaths (e.g. Salas 1987; Hucke-Gaete <em>et al</em>. 2004), and has incurred hostility from some fishermen (National Marine Fisheries Service 1998; Donoghue <em>et al</em>. 2003), including shooting of whales (González and Olivarría 2002).<br/><br/>Sperm Whale tissues have high levels of some contaminants (O'Shea 1999; Nielsen <em>et al</em>. 2000); however, any population-level effects on health are unknown. The effects of noise on Sperm Whales are also uncertain. Some evidence suggests that they are highly sensitive to noise (e.g., Watkins <em>et al</em>. 1985; Bowles <em>et al</em>. 1994) while other studies have found little or no effect (e.g., Madsen and Møhl 2000; Madsen <em>et al</em>. 2002). To date, all published studies of Sperm Whales and noise focus on short-term behavioural effects. Avoidance of sonar (Dawson pers. comm.) and seismic surveys (Mate <em>et al</em>. 1994; but see Madsen <em>et al</em>. 2002) has been observed but no mortality has been documented.<br/><br/>Whaling on Sperm Whales has at various times focussed almost exclusively on one sex or the other. Removals of large numbers of males may have had lingering effects on pregnancy rates in some subpopulations (Best 1979; Clarke <em>et al</em>. 1980; Whitehead <em>et al</em>. 1997) and large males are noticeably uncommon on some breeding grounds (Whitehead 2003). The removal of large numbers of females from social groups, and of older females in particular, may have lingering, socially disruptive effects. Furthermore, recovery might be inhibited via temporary or permanent loss of social cohesion and of socio-ecological knowledge such as is known to occur in other large-brained, long-lived social mammals (e.g., elephants, Poole and Thomsen 1989). <br/><br/>Maximum rates of increase for Sperm Whale populations are very low, possibly on the order of 1% per year (Whitehead 2002). Population growth/recovery can be expected to be low in the species.<br/><br/>Sperm Whales face other threats at a more regional level. These include collisions with ships (Laist <em>et al</em>. 2001), for instance off the Canary Islands (André and Potter 2000) and in the Mediterranean (Pesante <em>et al</em>. 2002), and ingestion of marine debris in the Mediterranean (e.g., Viale <em>et al</em>. 1992). <br/><br/>Causes for optimism: On the one hand, the Sperm Whale is not being heavily whaled at present and seems relatively secure from this threat in the short and medium term. When not being actively hunted, the Sperm Whale has rather little interaction with humans: most of its habitat is far from land, and few of its food sources (principally deep-water squid) are of currently harvested (Clarke 1977). Some populations, for instance the animals in the western North Atlantic that were little affected by modern whaling, seem healthy with reasonably high population densities and evidence of satisfactory reproduction (Gordon <em>et al</em>. 1998; National Marine Fisheries Service 2000).<br/><br/>Causes for concern: on the other hand, the Sperm Whale, with a maximum rate of increase of around 1% per year (Whitehead 2002), is not well adapted to recover from population depletion. Furthermore, the population model considers only one anthropogenic threat, whaling, and thus posits that the Sperm Whale population has recovered since about 1980 (Fig. 1 in linked PDF document), when large-scale commercial whaling was rapidly coming to an end. This recovery is purely theoretical, and may not be occurring as sperm whales carry high levels of some chemical contaminants (O'Shea 1999; Nielsen <em>et al</em>. 2000), ocean noise is increasing (Gordon and Moscrop 1996), interactions with fisheries continue to result in sperm whale deaths (International Whaling Commission 1994), and the lingering, socially disruptive effects of whaling may be inhibiting recovery of this highly social species (Whitehead <em>et al</em>. 1997). Some regional populations of sperm whales are declining or are apparently not recovering from depletion. Even in the absence of whaling, the Mediterranean population appears to have declined over the past 20 years, with bycatch in driftnets a likely principal cause (Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara 2006). The southeastern Pacific Sperm Whale population, very heavily whaled during the period 1950-1980, has an extremely low recruitment rate (probably below replacement), perhaps because of the social disruption caused by intense whaling (Whitehead <em>et al</em>. 1997). The population of mature and maturing males in the Antarctic was also heavily whaled over the same period, but should have repopulated from less heavily exploited breeding populations at lower latitudes following the end of large-scale commercial whaling. However, systematic surveys of Sperm Whales in the Antarctic showed no substantial or statistically significant increase between 1978 and 1992 (Branch and Butterworth 2001).","The only recent quantitative analysis of sperm whale population trends (Whitehead 2002; Fig. 1 in supplementary material, which constitutes an integral part of this assessment) suggests that a pre-whaling global population of about 1,100,000 had been reduced by about 29% by 1880 through “open-boat” whaling, and then to approximately 360,000 (67% reduction from initial) by the 1990s through modern whaling, although much uncertainty is associated with all these estimates (Fig. 1 in supplementary material). There is no direct evidence that any part of the population has increased since the end of large-scale whaling in about 1980, although for most areas there is also no direct evidence that they have not. In some areas there is concern that populations are continuing to decline (see below).<br/><br/>The species has a huge geographic range (Rice 1989) and a global population size in the 100,000's (Whitehead 2002; Fig 1). Although there is considerable uncertainty about sperm whale population parameters and levels of exploitation, Whitehead (2002) estimated historical trajectories of sperm whale abundance incorporating many, but not all, sources of uncertainty (Fig. 1 in supplementary material). That model was modified slightly (to produce an endpoint in 2003) and run to estimate the decline in global sperm whale population size between 1921 and 2003 (i.e. over approximately 3 generations; 82yr; see below for estimation of generation time) (H. Whitehead pers. comm.). As sperm whale population size seems to have changed rather little between about 1910-1930 (Whitehead 2002; Fig. 1 in supplementary material), the calculations are probably quite robust with reference to the estimated generation time. Using the “best” estimates of the model parameters (as in Whitehead 2002), the population in 2003 would have been 44% of that in 1921. Of 1,000 runs using model parameters randomly selected from within reasonable ranges (as in Whitehead 2002), 6% gave populations in 2003 of &lt;30% of that in 1922, 54% gave a 2003 population between 30-50% of that in 1992, and 40% suggested depletion levels of less than 50% over this time.<br/><br/> Arguments can be made that the model results are overly optimistic or overly pessimistic. Factors that would contribute to making the results overly optimistic that are not accounted for in the model include not accounting for under-reporting of illegal Soviet catches in the North Pacific and Antarctica and under-reporting of Japanese catches in the North Pacific (Kasuya and Brownell 2001), other continuing threats (described below), and factors such as continuing effects of social disruption from whaling that might inhibit recovery (consistent with an apparent lack of recovery in many areas). Factors that would contribute to making the results overly pessimistic include the assumption of a relatively low rate of increase in the model and the extrapolation of a relatively high estimate of g(0) (the proportion of whales detected on the trackline) from a single study to the global population. The direction of the effect of other uncertainties in model inputs, including the effects of sex-biased catches, is not certain. Despite these uncertainties, the Whitehead model provides the best available scientific evidence upon which to base this assessment. To reduce these uncertainties, future analyses would need to address the concerns identified above. <br/><br/>Efforts to assess the conservation status of sperm whales and the impact of historical whaling on contemporary structure are compromised by the absence of a good model of sperm whale population structure; pooling data may obscure distinct geographic patterns. While Sperm Whales are known to show long distance movements (Ivashin and Rovnin 1967; Mitchell 1975) and low genetic differentiation among ocean basins, several lines of evidence suggest that sperm whales past and present, have significant geographic structure. Analyses based on historical and contemporary data from tagging records (Rice 1974; Kasuya and Miyashita 1988), blood types (Fujino 1963), catch distributions, sighting patterns, size composition, lack of recovery from exploitation (Japan), timing of pregnancy (Best <em>et al</em>.1984), photo-identification (Whitehead 2003), genetics (Drouot 2004; Mesnick <em>et al</em>. 1999), cultural markers (Rendell and Whitehead 2003) and combinations thereof (Bannister and Mitchell 1980; Kasuya and Miyashita 1988) suggest evidence for structure in many regions. Over the past decade, several authors have investigated population structure in female Sperm Whales using sequence variation within the mitochondrial control region DNA (mtDNA) and/or polymorphic nuclear loci (microsatellites). In general, results tend to find low genetic differentiation among ocean basins and little evidence of subdivision within ocean basins, with the exception of some isolated basins such as the Mediterranean and Gulf of Mexico (Lyrholm <em>et al</em>. 1999; Mesnick <em>et al</em>. 1999; Drouot <em>et al</em>. 2004). However, factors such as low sample sizes, low mtDNA haplotypic diversity and social structure alone and together reduce the power to detect population structure. In addition, it is clear that biologically discrete populations of odontocetes can occur independently of strong geographic or oceanographic features. Alternative, non-geographic based hypotheses of population structure, such as dialect and differences in diet such as are found in Killer Whales, have not been thoroughly examined. For example, Rendell and Whitehead (2003) suggest that female populations seem to be culturally structured within oceans by “coda” vocalizations and may be genetically distinct (Rendell and Whitehead 2005, Rendell <em>et al</em>. 2005).",Unknown,"The Sperm Whale has a large geographic range (Rice 1989). It can be seen in nearly all marine regions, from the equator to high latitudes, but is generally found in continental slope or deeper water. The distribution extends to many enclosed or partially-enclosed seas, such as the Mediterranean Sea, Sea of Okhotsk, Gulf of California, and Gulf of Mexico.",The large-scale commercial harvesting of this species has ceased. Small-scales fisheries continue in Japan and Indonesia.,Marine,"The species is on Appendix I of CITES and Appendices I and II of CMS.<br/><br/>Management plans need both development and implementation. The International Whaling Commission manages sperm whale populations under the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, and Schedule of the Convention lists Sperm Whale seasons, Sperm Whale size limits and Sperm Whale catch limits (0 at present), as well as sanctuaries for all species in the Indian and Southern Oceans. However, no scheme for managing Sperm Whale populations is in place. Moreover, many range states are not members of the International Whaling Commission.<br/><br/>Regional subpopulations of Sperm Whales exist, and there has been an apparent lack of recovery in some areas or even continued decline (e.g., the Mediterranean (Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara 2006). Therefore, further assessments of the status of Sperm Whales should be conducted at the subpopulation level.",Afrotropical|Antarctic|Australasian|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Oceanian|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Pallas’s Cats are generally found at low densities, though in small rich patches in Russia they have been found at much higher density (Kirilyuk and Barashkova 2011). Their low density is believed to be a result of interspecific predation and the resulting habitat specialisation leading to a small percentage of the landscape being suitable for their needs. Due to their general low density and patchy distribution, relatively large areas are required to conserve viable populations (Ross et al. 2019a). Pallas’s Cats are also highly dependent on cavities to provide dens for daily use and rearing young, which further restricts habitat availability (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2010a).</p><p>Predation by sympatric carnivores, herding dogs, and human offtake are the main known causes of mortality, but habitat disturbance and fragmentation is believed to be their main threat (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019b). Mineral exploitation and infrastructure developments have increased throughout the species range. Pallas’s Cat also continues to be at risk from a declining prey base due to pika (<em>Ochotona</em> spp.) and rodent control programmes leading to prey depletion and secondary poisoning (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019b).</p><p>Due to the difficulty of observing the species, data generally consist of individual records, and there are no current monitoring programmes that would allow empirical estimates of population size or population trend. However, recent reviews have highlighted that the global population size is unlikely to be low enough to qualify as Near Threatened (Barashkova<em> et al. </em>2019). In addition, we used the methods of Santini <em>et al. </em>(2019) to quantify habitat loss and disturbance across Pallas’s Cats range between 1994 and 2015 (or three generations). The analyses indicated that between these years the change in suitable habitat and level of habitat fragmentation was low, suggesting suitable habitat is likely to be disappearing at a lower rate than previously assumed, and indicating the population may be more stable than thought. Though caution is needed as information on the Pallas’s Cat is incomplete, and threats may be acting at a different scale than our analyses. We also have no information describing the species population dynamics and how the population may track prey availability. Nevertheless, based on distributional data, the Pallas’s Cat population as a whole appears more stable than previously thought leading to its inclusion in the Least Concern category.</p><p>  </p><p>  </p><p>  </p>","<p></p><p>Pallas's Cat is distributed in landscapes with extreme continental climates - little rainfall, low humidity, and a wide range of temperatures. They are rarely found in areas where there is persistent snow cover of depths over 10 cm, and a continuous snow cover of 15–20 cm is thought to mark the ecological limit for this species (Heptner and Sludskii 1972, Kirilyuk and Puzanski 2000, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). They are generally associated with montane grassland steppe and shrub steppe, but are habitat specialists, selecting habitats providing hiding cover such as ravines, rocky areas, and disruptive vegetation cover that allow them to move through the landscape without being detected by predators (Ross 2009, Ross <em>et al. </em>2012). Their optimal habitat consists of a mix of grassland and shrub steppe with rocky cover, ravines, and hill-slopes. They are rarely found in lowland basins or flat featureless plains, although may access these areas through ravines or other disruptive cover, to access prey or in transit to better habitat (Ross 2009, Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2019, Ross <em>et al. </em>2019b).</p><p>A recent review discussed the general habitat features of Pallas’s Cats’ in Central Asia (Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019), Western Asia (Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019), and the Himalaya and China (Dhendup <em>et al. </em>2019). Central Asian habitats were characterised by hills, rocky outcrops, scree slopes, ravines, and rock cover, with petrophytic dry steppe or semi-desert vegetation (Heptner and Sludskii 1972; Sludskii 1982; Kirilyuk and Puzansky 2000; Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010a, b, 2012; Istomov <em>et al.</em> 2016; Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2019).</p><p>In Western Asia, a single record in the Iranian Caucasus suggests Pallas’s Cat uses open, hilly steppes and shrubland, with rocky outcrops and scattered trees (Aghili<em> et al. </em>2008). In Iran, the Pallas’s Cat occurs across a wide continuum of habitats, from arid grass­land steppes and dry mountains to temperate open shrublands. In Afghanistan, habitat consists of arid plateaus with flat and rolling mountains interspersed by rocky and deep valleys. In Pakistan, the species prefers alpine and sub­alpine scrub, dominated by rugged and broken terrain with high cliffs, ridges and ravines. In Turkmenistan, the species is predominantly associated with mountains and foothills (Heptner and Sludskii 1972, Rustamov and Hojamyradov 1994, Chalani <em>et al.</em> 2008, Joolaee<em> et al. </em>2014, Farhadinia et al. 2016, Talebi Otaghvar<em> et al. </em>2017, Adibi<em> et al. </em>2018, Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019). In Turkmenistan, the species is historically considered rare (Shukurov 1962) and predominantly associated with mountains and foothills of the Kopet Dag and the Big Balkan range (A. Potaeva and T. Rosen, pers. comm. 2019, Shukurov 1962). Pallas’s Cat has also been found in juniper woodland (<em>Juniperus </em>spp.) in Pakistan and Iran (Hameed <em>et al.</em> 2014, Dibadj <em>et al.</em> 2018). In Western Asia, the median elevation of Pallas’s Cat records is 2,372 m (range: 894–3,665 m), which corresponds to a mid-mountain elevation (Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019).</p><p>There are fewer records or accounts of Pallas’s Cat habitat in the Himalaya and China region, meaning we are unable to assess the importance of different habitat types. However, habitats of the region are generally of higher elevation with some of the highest elevation records found for the species (Fox and Dorji 2007, Chanchani 2008, Werhahn <em>et al. </em>2018, Dhendup <em>et al.</em> 2019, Pal <em>et al.</em> 2019). In Bhutan, with its warmer south-facing Himalayan slopes, Pallas’s Cat is found in rolling hills dominated by glacial out-wash and alpine steppe vegetation (<a name=""_Hlk10972711"">WWF 2012</a>, Thinley 2013). Pallas’s Cat occurs in Nepal in upper Manang valley within broken and rocky habitats, rolling hill slopes with few cliffs, and in Dolpo in rocky hill slopes within montane grassland steppe (Shrestha <em>et al.</em> 2014, Lama <em>et al.</em> 2016, Regmi <em>et al.</em> 2016). In India, the majority of records are from the Trans-Himalayan landscapes of Ladakh and Sikkim (Prater and Barruel 1971, Mallon 1991, Mahar <em>et al.</em> 2017, Pal <em>et al.</em> 2019). In the Tibetan region Pallas’s Cat has been reported in desert steppe habitat at 5,050 m dominated by <em>Stipa</em> spp. (Fox and Dorji 2007) and in mountainous alpine meadows in Qinghai (Li <em>et al. </em>2013) and Mountain steppe in Sichuan (Webb<em> et al.</em> 2014, 2016).</p><p>The observed large-scale habitat associations of Pallas’s Cat, which all contain some form of disruptive or hiding cover, can be explained by Pallas’s Cat being under constant risk of predation by sympatric aerial and terrestrial carnivores (Ross 2009). We have evidence of predation by numerous large raptors, and carnivores such as the grey wolf (<em>Canis lupus</em>), herding dogs, and red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), they are also hunted by humans (Ross 2009, Barashkova and Smelansky 2011; Ross <em>et al.</em> 2012, 2019b), other large carnivores, such as snow leopard, may also opportunistically predate Pallas’s Cat where they co-exist. The Pallas’s Cat is not a fast runner and when threatened by other predators its best line of defence is hiding out of sight, relying on their excellent camouflage and taking cover in burrows (of marmots or sympatric carnivores) or in rock crevices. In general, open areas without suitable cover are avoided and habitats with disruptive cover such as ravines, rocky areas, shrub-steppe, and hill-slopes are highly selected (Ross 2009, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010a). As a result, Pallas’s Cat uses only a small fraction of habitats available within the steppe ecosystem. Their habitat selection and specialisation is the most likely explanation for their low densities (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2016, 2019a), and should be accounted for in expert knowledge-based estimates of their potential population size.</p><p>Pallas’s Cat also has a dependency on refuges or dens. Dens are used on a daily basis to provide important cover from predators, for feeding, mating, giving birth, raising young, and for thermoregulation during the extremely cold winters (Ross <em>et al</em>. 2010a). Den availability is thought to be critical for survival, and a critical habitat requirement for their conservation (Ross 2009, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010a). Dens mostly consist of marmot burrows and rock crevices (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010a), in Southern Siberia and Kazakhstan the den sites of sympatric carnivores are more commonly used (Ross<em> et al</em>. 2019b), and in Iran Pallas’s Cat has been observed using aged Juniperus excelsa tree cavities as breeding dens (Dibadj <em>et al. </em>2018). Despite the range of habitats used by the species, the presence of suitable cavities appears to be a standard niche requirement (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019a).</p><p>The annual home ranges of Pallas’s Cat are unusually large for a small felid. Researchers in Mongolia</p><p>have measured mean annual home ranges as follows (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2012):</p><p>Female = 95% kernels 23.1 +/- 8.9 km²; 100% MCP = 64.1+/-18.6 km²; n = 13</p><p>Male = 95% kernels 98.8 +/- 17.2 km², 100% MCP = 159.0 +/- 59.3 km²; n = 9</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Radio-tracking studies of Pallas’s Cat in the Daursky State Nature Reserve (Zabaikalsky Krai, Russia)</p><p>calculated the following ranges (Barashkova and Kirilyuk 2011):</p><p>Female = 95% kernels 6.0 +/- 3.4 km²; 100% MCP = 10.0 +/- 6.5 km²; n = 4 </p><p>Male = 95% kernels 22.9 +/- 12.9 km²; 100% MCPs = 16.5 +/- 9.4 km²; n = 3</p><p>Pallas’s Cat diet is mainly composed of small lagomorphs and rodents, it is known to be a pika (Ochotona spp.) specialist (Ross et al. 2010b). Pikas are the most important prey across its range, typically comprising over 50% of the diet and highly selected over other prey species (Heptner and Sludskii 1972, Ross et al. 2010b). As pikas are 2–4 times larger than other common small mammal prey, Pallas’s Cat preference for them optimises hunting efficiency and energy intake. They also consume gerbils, jirds, voles, hamsters and ground squirrels; less frequently consumed prey includes small birds, young marmots, hares, hedgehogs, reptiles, and invertebrates (Kirilyuk 1999, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010b, Adibi <em>et al.</em> 2018, Werhahn <em>et al. </em>2018, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019, Moqanaki<em> et al.</em> 2019). Pallas’s Cats has also been recorded eating berries (Kirilyuk 1999) and scavenging from carcasses (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010b, 2019b).</p><p>                                                In an assessment of Pallas’s Cat habitat loss and fragmentation at a global scale, E.M. <span class=""A8"">Moqanaki, (unpublished analyses) used the methods of Santini <em>et al.</em> (2019) to quantify habitat loss and disturbance across Pallas’s Cats range (AOO) between 1994 and 2015 (or three generations). The analyses indicated that between these years the change in extent of suitable habitat within EOO (represented by ESA (2015)’s CCI land cover categories 120, 121, 122, 130, 140, 150, 200, 201, 202) and level of habitat fragmentation was very low (below 5%). As previous assessments have used estimates of habitat loss as justification to infer a declining Pallas’s Cat population, the analyses suggests the population is likely to be more stable than previously thought. A more detailed analyses, of habitat loss across the species range, that includes more variables and simulation, is recommended to provide a better indicator of Pallas’s Cat and other steppe species likely status.</p><span class=""A8""><p></p></span>","<p>Pallas’s Cat has several known and tested biological causes of vulnerability, including feeding and habitat specialisation, large home range sizes, making them difficult to protect within reserves, and a dependency on shelters made by other threatened species, such as Siberian marmots Marmota sibirica (Ross 2009, 2010 a,b, 2012).</p>  <p>In most regions, the specialist requirements of the Pallas’s Cat result in its distribution being naturally fragmented, due to resources and habitat patches being se­parated by large areas of poor habitat with insufficient prey or cover from predation (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2016, 2019b). As Pallas’s Cat is predated by sympatric carnivores it has a need for safe refuges, and so has a dependency on marmot burrows and rock cavities, particularly for raising young (Ross <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2010a). Most marmot species remain non-threatened but the Siberian Marmot, which overlaps Pallas’s Cat’s range in Russia and Mongolia, has declined due to overharvesting and is now classified as Endangered (Clayton 2016). The decline in marmots may result in the loss burrow habitat which is regarded as a keystone resource for Pallas’s Cat in many regions of grassland steppe across its range (Ross <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2010a).</p>  <p>The most serious threat to Pallas’s Cat across its range is habitat degradation and frag­mentation that are largely consequences of increasing livestock numbers, conversion of steppe grasslands into arable land, infrastruc­ture development and resource extraction. Mineral exploitation and infrastructural developments have also increased substantially across the range with increased frag­mentation as a result (Awehali 2011, Paltsyn <em>et al. </em>2012, Selles 2013; Ross <em>et al. </em>2016, 2019a). Due to degradation and loss of habitat, Pallas’s Cat populations are becoming increasingly fragmented, and isolated subpopulations are very likely disappearing without our knowledge (<a name=""_Hlk10872039"">Ross <em>et al. </em>2019</a>a). In Mongolia, for example, livestock numbers have increased from 26 million in 1991 to 66 million in 2018 (FAO 1998, National Statistical Office of Mongolia 2018). Increasing livestock numbers result in heavy grazing and habitat degradation, but also in displacement of Pallas’s Cats and increasing number of herding dogs which are known to kill the species (Ross 2009, Barashkova and Smelansky 2011, Ross <em>et al. </em>2012, Joolaee <em>et al.</em> 2014, Farhadinia <em>et al.</em> 2016, Ruta 2018). In Kazakhstan there is also a threat from farming, as large areas of secondary steppe grassland are being converted into arable pastures endangering local Pallas’s Cat subpopulations by increasing isolation and fragmentation of habitat (<a>A. Barashkova pers. comm. 2019).</a></p>  <p>Predation by herding dogs, feral dogs, acci­dental capture when trapping or snaring other animals, and illegal and legal hunting are the main recorded causes of direct anthropogenic mortality of Pallas’s Cats (Ross 2009, Barashkova and Smelansky 2011, Farhadinia <em>et al</em><em>.&#160;</em>2016, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2016, Ruta 2018, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019).</p>  <p>New emerging threats are also of con­cern. Climate change for example is predicted to have large impacts on the grasslands and mountain ecosystems of Central Asia and the Himalayas (Angerer <em>et al. </em>2008, Xu <em>et al. </em>2009). The potential impacts of climate change on Pallas’s Cats are unknown, but evidence sug­gests recent changes of the grassland and mountain ecosystems of Central Asia and Himalayas are at least in part related to cli­mate change (Angerer <em>et al.</em> 2008, Xu<em> et al.</em> 2009). Climate change is also predicted to have large impacts on steppe and mountain ecosystems in the future with a cascade of changes to the ecosystem likely to follow (IPCC 2014). As Pallas’s Cat is a strict seasonal breeder, female ovulation and male sperm production are both regulated by day length and peak during the late winter breeding season (Brown <em>et al. </em>2002). Con­sidering that the breeding season is dictated by day length, as opposed to climate, Pallas’s Cats may be unable to respond to seasonal changes in ecological parameters that result from climate change. As indicated by large gains in body mass, Pallas’s Cats build-up en­ergy reserves during the summer when prey is abundant (Ross 2009, Naidenko<em> et al. </em>2014), and invest these reserves in reproduction during the late winter when prey availability is low (Ross <em>et al. </em>2010a). As climate change alters seasonal patterns, and with it prey availability, this is likely to affect Pallas’s Cats’ ability to balance energy reserves (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019a).</p>  The poisoning of small mammals, such as pikas and Brandt’s vole Lasiopodomys brandtii, is still occurring in the steppe ecosystem, with an aim of reducing disease transmission from small mammals to humans and livestock and improving range­land quality for livestock (Smith <em>et al. </em>2008). Although information is scarce, poisoning continues in China where pika populations can be reduced by 95% (Lai and Smith 2003, Ba­dingqiuying <em>et al. </em>2016). In the Qinghai-Tibe­tan Plateau, for example, between 2006 and 2013 approximately $25.5 million was spent to eradicate the plateau pika (<em>O. curzoniae</em>) from over 78,500 km2 in Sanjiangyuan National Nature Reserve alone (Wilson and Smith 2015). Research has also shown carnivore populations may suffer declines as a consequence of poisoning campaigns (Badingqiuying <em>et al.</em> 2016). In Mongolia, campaigns to control small mammal numbers have occurred in all provinces (Clark <em>et al.</em> 2006, Winters 2006, Ross <em>et al. </em>2016) but there is no informa­tion on its current prevalence. In Russia and Kazakhstan poisoning occurs at a local scale to control local disease outbreaks (Barashkova et al. 2019). Although the occurrence of poisoning has very likely decreased over the last decade, where the practice continues there is little doubt that aerial and terrestrial carnivores will suffer multiple consequences, such as secondary poisoning and prey depletion (Ross <em>et al. </em>2019a).<p></p>","<p>As Pallas’s Cat has a wide yet fragmented distribution across the grasslands and montane steppes of Central and Western Asia, we assume the global population is fragmented into many sub-populations. Due to the difficulty of reliably and repeatedly detecting Pallas’s Cat by any survey protocol, the differentiation of sub-populations and the estimate of population size remains extremely difficult. Nevertheless, several estimates of population density have been made, using several methods. In central Mongolia, an estimate of 4–8 cats/100 km² was made based upon radio telemetry of 28 cats, weekly spotlight surveys, and observations while radiotracking over a period of 2 years, giving confidence that most individuals were observed (Ross 2009). Several population estimates have been made in Russia, based on snow tracking and correction formulas. Snow tracking studies in Russia have suggested that the Pallas’s Cat can periodically occur at very high densities up to 100 cats/100 km² in areas of Dauria (Kirilyuk and Barashkova 2011, Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2017). Confirming the high densities, Naidenko <em>et al.</em> (2014) captured a total of 16 Pallas’s Cats in an area of 16 km², equating to an apparent density of 100 cats/100 km² in Dauria. Though the high density is very likely to be a localised phenomenon, possibly related to prey eruptions. However, given the lack of repeated occurrences of the Pallas’s Cat in many areas across its range, it seems low density (4 cats/100 km²&#160;) is a more applicable average density for the species.&#160;&#160;</p>  In a recent review of Pallas’s Cat in Russia and Central Asia, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> (2019) estimated the potential population size in this region as approximately 49,000–98,000. Though they added the estimate is highly speculative. The estimate also assumed the entire predicted suitable habitat is currently occupied. Based on our understanding of the AOO (based on predictive models of Pallas's Cat occupancy), we estimate the global population of mature Pallas's Cats at approximately 58,000. This is based on the assumption that within the AOO Pallas's Cat has an average density of 4 cats/100 km², and that 20% of the population are immature non-breeders.&#160; Despite the speculative nature of these estimates, they indicate that the population size of Pallas’s Cat almost certainly exceeds the limits specified under the Near Threatened classification.<p></p>",Decreasing,"<p>  </p><p>The Pallas’s Cat primarily occurs within regions of montane grassland and shrubland steppe of Central Asia, but is found as far west as Western Iran and previously extended into Armenia and Azerbaijan (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2016). The core populations of Pallas’s Cat are believed to occur in Mongolia and China (Smith <em>et al.</em>&#160;2008, Jutzeler et al. 2010). In Russia, the Pallas’s Cat occurs along the border with Mongolia and China mainly in the Altai, Tyva, and Buryatia Republics (Altai and Sayan Mountains), and Trans-Baikal Territory (Koshkarev 1998, Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2007). They are found in mountain steppe and semi desert foothills in Central and eastern Kazakhstan (Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019), and some areas of Kyrgyzstan (Snow Leopard Trust 2014, Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2019). In Uzbekistan and Tajikistan the species was recorded before the 1960s but not more recently (Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2019).</p><p>Outside Iran, records of Pallas’s Cat in the southwest of its range (also vaguely known as the Caspian Sea range; Southern Caucuses, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan) are rare and thus the conservation status of the species there is unknown (Habibi 2004, Hameed<em> </em><em>et al.</em> 2014<a name=""_Hlk12187509"">, Farhadinia <em>et al. </em>2016</a>, Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019). Iran appears to have the widest geographic distribution of the Pallas’s Cat in this region, where most of the recent occurrence records are associated with the two main mountain chains of Alborz and Zagros in the north and west, respectively (Karami <em>et al.</em> 2016, Moqanaki <em>et al. </em>2019, Yusefi <em>et al.</em> 2019). In Afghanistan, multiple occurrences have been recently collected from Bamyan Province during camera trap surveys for the Persian leopard (<em>Panthera pardus</em>; WCS 2017). Recent occurrence records from Pakistan are restricted to Gilgit-Baltistan, and there is evidence they inhabit the border area with Afghanistan (<a name=""_Hlk12187460"">Hameed <em>et al.</em> 2014, </a>Hussain 2018). The latest Pallas’s Cat records from Turkmenistan are from Dushak Erekdag in the Kopet Dag, the Turkmen-Khorasan Mountain Range in the borderland with north-eastern Iran (A. Potaeva and T. Rosen, pers. comm. 2019). The species presence in Pakistan’s Baluchistan Province, as well as Armenia and Azerbaijan in the Caucasus, is uncertain (Moqanaki<em> et al</em>. 2019).</p><p>        Recent records from Bhutan, Nepal, and India also suggest Pallas’s Cat presence in the Eastern Himalayan region but at a low density (WWF 2012, Thinley 2013, Shrestha <em>et al.</em> 2014, Mahar<em> et al</em>. 2017, Dhendup <em>et al</em>. 2019, <a name=""_Hlk12187607"">Pal <em>et al</em>. 2019</a>). The highest elevation record for Pallas’s Cat, of 5,593 m, was found in the Himalayan region in Nepal (Werhahn <em>et al</em>. 2018).</p><p>  </p>","<p>The extent of illegal hunting and illegal trade of Pallas’s Cats or their body parts is unknown (Barclay <em>et al.</em> 2019, Ross <em>et al. </em>2019a). It has been reported that international trade in Pallas’s Cat pelts ceased since the late 1980s, and Mongolia is the only range country where hunting of Pallas’s Cat is per­mitted today, although they can be hunted in China if a special license is obtained (Lu <em>et al. </em>2010, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2016, Barclay <em>et al.</em> 2019). The permitting system in Mongolia is said to be ineffective and Pallas’s Cat furs were exported illegally to China (Murdoch <em>et al. </em>2006). It has been estimated that there were about 1,000 legal Pallas’s Cat hunters in Mongolia with a mean harvest rate of 2 Pallas’s Cats per hunter per year (Wingard and Zahler 2006). It is difficult to estimate levels of illegal hunting, though it is likely much higher than the legal level of hunting and is known to happen across all range countries. Evidence of illegal trade in Pallas’s Cat is reported from Afghanistan and Pakistan (e.g. Kretser <em>et al. </em>2012), but it seems to be only occasional and opportunistic, though this may reflect the rarity of Pallas’s Cat. Marmots are commonly hunted in most of the Pallas’s Cats range and Pallas’s Cats are often mistaken for marmots and shot (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2019b). They are also trapped incidentally in leg-hold traps and snares set for other animals (Ross 2009). The fat and organs of Pallas’s Cats are used as medicine in Mongolia and Russia (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2016, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019). A report from Kyrgyzstan suggests that Pallas’s Cat is often harvested in winter by tracking them back to their den and capturing them using snares (T. Rosen pers. comm. 2020). Undoubtably more information on illegal offtake of Pallas’s Cat is needed, as hunting could be a more significant threat than we currently assume, certainly at a local level but possibly also range wide.</p>",Terrestrial,"<p><span class=""A9"">In 2019 a conservation action plan was written to move towards promoting the survival of Pallas’s Cat across its historic range. The action plan has a number of conservation actions including increasing conservation research, education and awareness, decreasing human caused mortality and coordinating conservation efforts. These actions will be implemented over the next 10 years (<span class=""A15"">Pallas's Cat Global Action Planning Group 2019), and consequently, conservation action is expected to increase in the near future.</span></p>  <p>In situ conservation of the species occurs mainly through prohibi­tion or regulation of hunting and trade, and habitat conservation within protected areas (Barashkova et al. 2019; Pallas’s Cat is listed under CITES Appendix II as <em>Felis manul</em>). Hunting of this species is prohibited in most current range countries except Mongolia (Nowell and Jackson 1996), which restricts hunting and regulates trade through a permitting system. Trophy hunters can purchase limited hunting licenses in Mongolia and export trophies (Clark <em>et al</em><em>. </em>2006).</p>  <p>Using predictive modelling across Central Asia, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> (2019) estimated that suitable Pallas’s Cat habitats cover 170 protected areas of Russia, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan; although confirmation of the species has only been documented in 36 of the protected areas. In Russia, the Tyvan and Daurian State Nature Reserves remain the most important protected areas for Pallas’s Cat conservation, the recently created federal refuge in Dzeren's Valley (subordinated to Daursky reserve) is also occupied by Pallas’s Cat's ( Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019). Although research is ongoing in Western Asia and the Himalaya, conservation actions are currently limited (<span class=""A8"">Moqanaki<em> et al. </em>2019, Dhendup <em>et al</em>. 2019). A preliminary assessment of the potential distribution of the Pallas’s Cat in Western Asia predicted vast climatic suitability across mid-elevation areas in this region, yet dispersal barriers and biotic interactions (e.g. predator-prey relationships) may have restricted the currently occupied habitat (Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019). The same is true of China, but Pallas’s Cat has been reported in several protected areas including: Xuelingyunshan, Tuomuerfeng, Luoshan, Baijitan, Qinghaihuniaodao, Wanglang, Wolong, Zhumulangmafeng, Kalamailishan, Qitaihuangmobanhuangmo, Aerjinshan, Ganjiahu (Xinjiang), Luobupoyeluotuo (CSIS 2008). It is reportedly present in at least 29 Chinese Nature Reserves (Mallon 2002, Smith <em>et al.</em> 2008, Jutzeler <em>et al</em><em>. </em>2010, <span class=""A8"">Dhendup<em> et al. </em>2019).</span></p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Required Conservation Actions</p>  <p></p><ol><li>Implimentation of conservation action plan (Pallas's Cat Global Action Planning Group 2019).</li><li>Confirm occupancy in protected areas within the species EOO, and extend to confirm occupancy in suitable habitats predicted using distribution models. </li><li>Establish a suitable and quantifiable monitoring method for the species.</li><li>Identify and implement population monitoring in key areas that have potential to indicate the species status at a wider scale. </li><li>Identify regions where human caused threats endanger Pallas’s Cat and implement mitigation measures.&#160; </li><li>Recommend new protected areas in Pallas’s Cat hotspots not currently protected. </li><li>Increase collaboration between Pallas’s Cat researchers to validate and refine population distribution and habitat distribution models.&#160; </li><li>Understand the species population dynamics in relation to potential prey population cycles in areas where we know large population fluctuations occur (such as the Daurian steppe).
