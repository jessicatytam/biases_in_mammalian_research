3208340,10707,Hyperoodon ampullatus,Data Deficient,,2007,2007-01-26 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Hyperoodon ampullatus</em> is widespread throughout the north Atlantic region. Population trend data for this species are unavailable. A primary threat that could cause widespread declines is vulnerability to high-level anthropogenic sound sources, especially military sonar and seismic surveys. Although the current population remains depleted from whaling the decline took place more than three generation lengths ago.<br/><br/>The combination of possible declines driven by vulnerability to high-level anthropogenic sound sources and bycatch is believed sufficient that a 30% reduction over three generations (in this case 54 years) could not be ruled out.  Therefore, the species is currently considered to be Data Deficient.","The behavior and ecology of northern bottlenose whales have been better studied than that of any other species in the family Ziphiidae.  Most groups contain at least four whales, sometimes with as many as 20, and there is some segregation by age and sex. These deep divers can remain submerged for an hour, possibly as long as two, and can reach depths of well over 1,400 m (Hooker and Baird 1999). They are known for their curiosity, often approaching and swimming around boats for some time, as well as their habit of ""standing by"" injured companions; these behaviours permitted whalers to kill large numbers of whales at the same site (Gray 1882). Although capable of travelling long distances, their movement patterns are generally quite localized (Hooker <em>et al.</em> 2002, Whitehead <em>et al.</em> 2003). <br/><br/>These cold temperate to subarctic whales are found in deep waters, mostly seaward of the continental shelf (and generally over 500-1,000 m deep) and near submarine canyons.  They sometimes travel several kilometres into broken ice fields, but are more common in open water.  Few whales were caught in shallow waters over the continental shelf off Labrador and in waters less than 1000 m deep off the west coast of Norway. In the surrounding waters of Iceland, the whales were sighted in waters with surface temperature between -1.3°C and +0.9°C (Reyes 1991).<br/><br/>Northern bottlenose whales occupy a very narrow niche; their primary food source is squid of the genus <em>Gonatus</em> (Hooker <em>et al.</em> 2001, Whitehead <em>et al.</em> 2003) These whales may also occasionally eat fish (such as herring and redfish), sea cucumbers, starfish, and prawns. They do much of their feeding on or near the bottom in very deep water (&gt;800 m, and as deep as 1,400 m: Hooker and Baird 1999). Longevity is at least 37 years, possibly much longer (Christensen 1973).","This is one of only a few species of beaked whales to be hunted commercially on a large scale. Hunts occurred from the 1850s to the 1970s, and over 65,000 whales were killed (with many more struck but lost: Reeves <em>et al.</em> 1993). By far the major bottlenose whaling nation has been Norway, though some hunting was also done by the UK and Canada. The northern bottlenose was sought after for its oil (including a form of spermaceti oil in the head) and later for pet food. No hunting of this species has been conducted by Norway since 1973 (Jefferson <em>et al.</em> 1993, Reyes 1991). The species has been essentially unexploited for almost 30 years, with only a few animals taken in some years in the Faroe Islands. The aggregate population was certainly reduced by whaling, and the extent of recovery is uncertain (Reeves <em>et al.</em> 2003).  Mitchell (1977) considered that the population was severely depleted in both the early and modern whaling periods. Very few incidental catches have been reported (Reyes 1991). <br/><br/>Pollutant levels in this species are usually low (Reyes 1991). There are no major fisheries for squid in the Northeast Atlantic, but future developments could represent some threat for subpopulations as heavily depleted as those of the bottlenose whale (Culik 2004). This species, like other beaked whales, is likely to be vulnerable to loud anthropogenic sounds, such as those generated by navy sonar and seismic exploration (Cox <em>et al.</em> 2006).","Global numbers of northern bottlenose whales are largely unknown. There are estimated to be more than 5,000 in the waters around Iceland and the Faroe Islands. An estimated 40,000 occur in the eastern North Atlantic (NAMMCO Annual Report 1995), including approximately 5,827 (CV=16%) in the high latitudes of the eastern North Atlantic (Gunnlaugsson and Sigurjónsson 1990). Estimates for Icelandic and Faroese waters are 3,142 and 287 whales respectively, although allowance was not made in the surveys for animals not observed because of their long dives (Reyes 1991). Most populations of the species are probably still depleted, due to large kills in the past; over 65,000 animals were killed in a multinations hunt that operated in the North Atlantic from c.1850 to the early 1970s (Mitchell 1977, Reeves <em>et al.</em> 1993). A study by Christensen and Ugland (1983) resulted in an estimated initial (pre-whaling) population size of about 90,000 whales, reduced to some 30,000 by 1914. The population size by the mid 1980s was said to be about 54,000, nearly 60% of the initial stock size.",Unknown,"Northern bottlenose whales are found only in the North Atlantic, from New England, USA to Baffin Island and southern Greenland in the west and from the Strait of Gibraltar to Svalbard in the east (c. 38ºN to 72ºN: Mead 1989, Gowans 2002).  There are reports from the Mediterranean Sea, and some extralimital records from the Baltic Sea. Bottlenose whales are occasionally observed off the Azores (Steiner <em>et al.</em> 1998), and have been seen as far south as the Cape Verde Islands (15ºN: Ruud 1937). The pelagic distribution extends from the ice edges south to approximately 30°N. Historic catch distributions indicated the existence of at least six centres of abundance, each potentially representing a separate stock (Benjaminsen 1972): i) the Gully; ii) northern Labrador-Davis Strait; iii) northern Iceland; iv) and v), off Andenes and Møre, Norway, and vi) around Svalbard, Spitzbergen. Anecdotal reports from whalers suggest a north/south seasonal migration could occur in some regions but there is little strong evidence for this. They inhabit the most northerly waters of the Barents and Greenland seas in summer (May to August). The northern bottlenose whale forms an antitropical species pair with the southern bottlenose whale, <em>Hyperoodon planifrons</em>.","This species was heavily exploited in the past for multiple purposes, but there is now only a very small-scale fishery in the Faroes. For further details, see threats section.",Marine,"The northern bottlenose whale is said to have been twice overexploited by Norwegian hunting, in the periods 1880-1920 and 1938-1973. It was included in the International Whaling Commission schedule in 1977, with recommendations that northern bottlenose whales be granted Protected Stock status with zero catch limit (Klinowska 1991). It is listed in Appendix II of the Convention on Migratory Species as well as in Appendix I of CITES. Populations or stocks are not defined; this, together with estimates of present abundance as well as present levels of catches (Faroe Islands), should be the focus of future studies (Reyes 1991, Culik 2004, Dalebout <em>et al.</em> 2006).","",,false,false,Europe

It is a strictly nocturnal species, and its remains are commonly found in owl pellets. The species has a litter size of four to five young.","In some areas in Jordan, the species is spotlighted and hunted for food and bait for falconry. Locally eaten by humans, since they are easily caught through their burrow systems. Can be trapped during grooming outside the burrow and are considered edible by several tribes of Bedouin in Jordan and the Negev (Qumsiyeh 1996). In Syria, there is massive capture (using spotlights at night), and the species is sold to falconers for food (G. Serra pers. comm.).

However, if conservation actions for the species were stopped or reduced, the species would very quickly move back into a threatened category. Hence the Near Threatened listing is a precautionary one based on Criterion A3 and A4, as it is suspected that if conservation measures ceased, declines over a 12 year (=3 generation) period in the future, or including both the past and the future, might approach 30%.","It is known from a wide variety of aquatic habitats, including highland and lowland lakes, rivers, streams, marshes, swamp forests and coastal areas. It is very adaptable, using saltwater as well as freshwater habitats, and even sewerage systems in urban areas. In most parts of its range otter distribution is correlated with presence of riverbank vegetation. Otters in different regions may depend upon different features of the habitat, but the important component of otter habitat, for breeding purposes, is the presence of holes in the river bank, including cavities among tree roots, piles of rock, wood or debris. The Eurasian otter avoids deep water. Their distribution in coastal areas is strongly correlated with the presence of freshwater. The location of breeding holts is not confined to river banks; there is evidence to indicate that sometimes the species breeds well away from water and the pups are moved to holts on the river banks once they are a few months old (Reuther and Hilton-Taylor 2004).","The aquatic habitats of otters are extremely vulnerable to man-made changes. Canalisation of rivers, removal of bank side vegetation, dam construction, abstraction of water for irrigation, draining of wetlands, agricultural activities and associated man-made impacts on aquatic systems are all unfavourable to otter populations. Pollution is major threat to the otters in western and central Europe, the main pollutants posing a danger to otters are the organochlorines dieldrin (HEOD) and DDT/DDE, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and the heavy metal mercury. Coastal populations are particularly vulnerable to oil spills. Acidification of rivers and lakes results in the decline of fish biomass and reduces the food resources of the otters. The same effects are known to result from organic pollution by nitrate fertilisers, untreated sewage, or farm slurry. In addition, major causes of mortality from several countries are drowning, road kills, and poaching. Fyke nets set for eels and other fish as well as creels set for marine crustaceans are very attractive to otters, and many that try to enter these traps are entangled and drowned. A further potential threat is strangulation by transparent, monofilament drift net. A potential risk comes from traps designed to kill other species, especially underwater cages constructed to drown muskrats. Illegal hunting is still a problem in many parts of their distribution range. In several European countries political pressure especially by fishermen has resulted in granting of licenses for killing otters (Reuther and Hilton-Taylor 2004). Illegal killing for the trade of pelts is on the increase in Ukraine and Danube Delta, and probably in the eastern parts of its global range (European Mammal Assessment Workshop 2006).","Expanding throughout most of its European range following historic declines up until the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s; although in the European part of Russia there have been recent marked declines, and isolated populations in countries like Turkey, Italy, Georgia, Armenia are still declining. The UK population started to recover in the 1960s (Battersby 2005). The population in Portugal is stable and did not show much decrease historically (Cabral <em>et al.</em> 2005). In Norway, although the range is increasing on the south-western coast, the population appears to have declined again since the mid 1990s (T. Heggberget pers. comm. 2006).",Unknown,"The Eurasian otter has the widest distribution of all otter species. Its range covers parts of three continents: Europe, Asia and Africa. Originally the species was widespread throughout Europe, but it declined dramatically in the 1960s and 1970s, and has disappeared from parts of central and northern Europe (it is probably extinct in Liechtenstein, the Netherlands, and Switzerland: Prigioni 1999). It is not found on most of the Mediterranean islands due to the lack of appropriate habitat, although it is found on Corfu (Greece). Little is known about the original distribution in Africa and Asia. Otters have been found in brackish waters below sea level in the Netherlands, and up to 2,400 m in the Pyrenees. Outside Europe they have been recorded up to 4,120 m in Tibet (Reuther and Hilton-Taylor 2004).",,Terrestrial,"It is strictly protected under international legislation and conventions: CITES Appendix I (Reservation by Russian Federation), Bern Convention Appendix II, EU Habitats and Species Directive Annexes II and IV, and EC 338/97 Annex A. Additionally it is protected under national law in many range states. A European Breeding Programme (EEP) for self-sustaining captive populations was started in 1985. Monitoring programmes have been established in many range states in Europe. Road barriers and tunnels under roads are required to reduce the impact of road kills (especially in countries like Germany where road kills are the main threat). Much more monitoring is required, but also better survey techniques are required. For example, the population on the Shetlands is well-surveyed, and survey results show no indications of decline, but evidence from other sources (breeding holts, changes in diet, etc.) indicate that declines are in fact happening (J. Conroy pers. comm. 2006).",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Europe

If the Christmas Island population was found to be specifically distinct, it would be assessed as Critically Endangered given that its population declined by 83% in 3 generations, and the causes of the decline are not known and may not have ceased.","In South Asia, this species roosts in large colonies consisting of several thousands of individuals in the mangrove vegetation (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2002). Feeds on both wild and cultivated fruit. A single young is born (Bates and Harrison 1997). It has been observed to feed on <em>Bombax</em> spp. and Sterculia spp. (Aul and Vijaykumar 2003). On Christmas Island part of the population roosts in large camps at traditional locations and part roosts scattered singly and in small groups through the forest. It was recorded roosting in 11 tree species in December 2005-Feb 2006 (Orchard 2006). Camps are always near the coast (D. J. James pers. comm.). Numbers in camps fluctuate widely, possibly in response to winds that facilitate emergence (D. J. James pers. comm.). They feed on a number of rainforest fruits and flowers; of 26 known species in the diet, 10 are introduced species and at least five of these 10 seem to be very important (Orchard 2006). It is relatively diurnal, emerging from camps well before dusk. Non-flying young have been recorded in December and January (Orchard 2006; D. J. James pers. comm.).","In the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, this species is threatened by deforestation, generally resulting from logging operations and the conversion of land to agricultural purposes. It is also threatened due to tourism related developmental activities (Molur <em>et al.</em> 2002), and from overhunting at daytime roosts, as the bones are crushed and used as asthma medicine (L. Lumsden pers. comm.). These bats are kept as pets on Car Nicobar, Kamorta, Katchal, Pulo Milo and Trinket Islands. The December 2004 tsunami is likely to have damaged the mangrove habitat of this species, however, further research is needed to confirm that the species has declined because of this event. The population on the Indonesian island of Enggano may have been wiped out by a hurricane, although this needs to be confirmed, and while threats to the species on Nias are not known, they presumably include general habitat loss. It is preyed on by feral cats on Christmas Island, and there has also been some hunting, including large numbers (up to 200), in the past, however, there is no recent evidence of hunting in this part of the species range (D. J. James pers. comm.). Corbett <em>et al.</em> (2003) hypothesised that a severe cyclone in 1988 initiated the decline in the Christmas Island population. However, other anecdotal evidence indicates that the decline began in the mid 1990s (Orchard 2006). The Yellow Crazy Ant <em>Anoplolepis gracilipes</em> has caused general ecological breakdown on Christmas Island since the late 1990s (O'Dowd <em>et al.</em> 2003). Disease (speculative) may be a factor. Threats to the Christmas Island population have proven difficult to identify, and are likely to be a combination of factors (Orchard 2006). James <em>et al.</em> (2007), provide a detailed account of possible threats to the species including, predation or disturbance by both, or either, introduced and native species; predation and/or persecution by humans (mostly formerly); loss of habitat; storm events; accidental poisoning; light pollution; and disease and parasites. James <em>et al</em>. (2007), also give a 'threat assessment matrix' indicating the likelihood of each potential threat.","Aul and Vijaykumar (2003) report a colony of more than 300 individuals in a mangrove creek on Great Nicobar Island. Aul and Vijaykumar (2003) also counted more than 500 individuals in the mangroves and under Nypa palms on Tillangchong Island in the Nicobars; 10-15 individuals have been recorded from palm fronds on Tillangchong Island, with several pups in this colony in the month of March. There appears to be no information on the current status of the population in the Mentawi Islands. On Christmas Island in 1984 the population was estimated to contain 3,500 individuals in five main camps and a further 2,500 individuals scattered singly or in small groups (Tidemann 1985). The camps were thought to have been historical, dating to before human settlement. By 1989 one more camp had been located, bringing the total to six camps, but only containing a hundred or so extra animals (Tidemann <em>et al</em>. 1993). Duncan <em>et al</em>. (1999) interpreted Tidemann's population figures as ""less than 10,000 animals"". In 1997-1998, few camps could be found and these contained few individuals (P. Meek, via L. Lumsden pers. comm.). In August 2002 only 17 Individuals were recorded during 26 field days of a general fauna survey, and the population was loosely estimated to be in the order of 500 to 1,000 individuals (Corbett <em>et al. </em>2003). In April 2004 only one of the original five known camps could be found, and in November 2004 that camp contained 299 individuals (D. J. James pers. comm.). In December 2005, two of the six colonies once known were active but extensive searches for additional colonies were not successful. Counts in these two colonies from January to March 2006 varied between 14 and 500 individuals, apparently in response to local wind conditions. The number of bats roosting away from camps has not been estimated accurately, but is likely to be less than the number in camps; nocturnal surveys reveal wide distribution of foraging animals. The entire population was unlikely to number more than 1,000 individuals in March 2006 (Orchard 2006; D. J. James pers. comm.). In September 2006, there was a count of 1,381 individuals on Christmas Island (James <em>et al</em>. 2007).",Decreasing,"This species is limited to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands of India (Bompuka, Car Nicobar, Great Nicobar (including Campbell Bay), Kamorta, Katchal, Kondul, Nancowrie, South Sentinel, Tilangchong, Tressa and Trinket Islands [<em>Pteropus melanotus melanotus</em>] and South Andaman and Rutlans Islands [<em>Pteropus melanotus tytleri</em>]) (Molur <em>et al.</em> 2002), the Mentawi Islands (Nias and Enggano [<em>Pteropus melanotus modiglianii</em>]) of Indonesia, and Christmas Island of Australia (<em>Pteropus melanotus natalis</em>).

They are present off Japan, and some have been taken in drive fisheries there. There are anecdotal reports of potentially large numbers of dolphins, including long-beaked common dolphins, killed for bait in some coastal fisheries off Baja California, Mexico (K. Forney pers. comm.). Long-beaked common dolphins have been taken opportunistically by harpoon in northeastern Taiwan and are caught incidentally by oceanic driftnets off eastern Taiwan (J.

In Eritrea, <em>Pannicum turgidium</em> is an important forage species (Teclai 2006).","The major threat to the African Wild Ass is hunting for food and medicinal purposes; for example, body parts and soup made from bones are used for treating tuberculosis, constipation, rheumatism, backache, and boneache (Kebede 1999; Moehlman 2002; Moehlman <em>et al.</em> in press). Limited access to drinking water and forage (largely due to competition with livestock) is also a major constraint, with reproductive females and foals less than three-months old most at risk. Hence, it will continue to be important to determine critical water supplies and basic forage requirements, allowing management authorities to determine (in consultation with local pastoralists) how to conserve the African Wild Ass (Kebede 1999, 2007; Moehlman 2002; Teclai 2006; Moehlman <em>et al</em>. in press). The third major threat to the survival of the African Wild Ass is possible interbreeding with the domestic donkey (Moehlman 2002; Moehlman <em>et al</em>. in press).","In Ethiopia, there has been a severe population decline since the early 1970s. Klingel (1972) recorded group sizes of 10-30 individuals in the Danakil, and he estimated a density of 18.6 wild asses per 100 km² in an area of approximately 10,000 km². During that survey, Yangudi-Rassa National Park had the highest density (30 wild asses per 100 km²). In 1994, Moehlman and Kebede did a ground survey of the Yangudi-Rassa N.P.; no wild asses were seen, although local Issa pastoralists reported that they were present but rare and occurred at an approximate density well below one animal per 100 km² (Moehlman 1994; Kebede 1995; Moehlman <em>et al.</em> 1998). In 2007, Kebede (F. Kebede <em>et al.</em> pers. comm. 2007) surveyed the historic range of the African Wild Ass in Ethiopia and determined that they have been extirpated from the Yangudi-Rassa N.P. and the Somali Region and that the only remaining population is in the north-eastern Afar Region. The total number of wild ass observed during this survey was 25 in an area of 4,000 km² yielding a density of 0.625 animals per 100 km². This density is higher than that of 1994-1998 survey, which was 0.5 wild ass per 100 km² in an area of 2,000 km² (Moehlman 2002). In the Serdo-Hillu area, where there has been a research and conservation programme with Ethiopian Wildlife Conservation Authority and local Afar pastoralists for the past ten years, the population has remained stable. Although the number of African Wild Ass in this area has not declined, the population is very small and under high risk of extinction. There may be fewer than 200 African Wild Ass left in Ethiopia.<br/><br/>In Eritrea, there are limited long-term data. The first successful survey was made in 1996 and there has been a research and conservation programme with the Ministry of Agriculture for the past ten years. The main study site in the Northern Red Sea Zone has had a population of roughly 47 individuals per 100 km² (Moehlman <em>et al</em>. 1998; Moehlman 2002). This is the highest population density found anywhere in the present range of the species and is similar to population densities recorded in Ethiopia in the early 1970s. This is a limited study area (100 km²), but recent research indicates that African Wild Ass currently inhabit approximately 11,000 km² in the Denkeli desert (Teclai 2006). Surveys are needed to determine the distribution and density of African Wild Ass in this larger area. A rough estimate of African Wild Ass in Eritrea would yield a total of possibly 400 individuals. <br/><br/>In Somalia, in 1997, local pastoralists said that there were less than 10 African Wild Ass left in the Nugaal Valley; an earlier ground survey in 1989 in the Nugaal Valley yielded population estimates of roughly 135-205 animals or approximately 2.7-4.1/km² (Moehlman 1998). Some animals may remain near Meit and Erigavo, but this area has not been surveyed since the 1970s (Moehlman <em>et al</em>. in press). It is not known if African Wild Ass currently persist in Somalia.<br/><br/>In summary, the total number of observed African Wild Ass in Eritrea and Ethiopia is 70 individuals; there may be as many as 600 individuals in these two countries, but this figure is a very rough extrapolation from more intensely studied areas. The number of mature individuals is approximately one-third of the population (Feh <em>et al</em>. 2001), hence the minimum number of mature individuals is 23 and the maximum might be 200. In Ethiopia, in the last 35 years there has been a greater that 95% population decline and in the last 12 years the African Wild Ass has been extirpated from roughly 50% of its range (Kebede <em>et al</em>. 2007). In Eritrea, the population is stable and slowly increasing. However, it is difficult to predict population trends into the future. The desert habitat of the African Wild Ass in both Eritrea and Ethiopia suffers from recurrent and extreme droughts (Kebede 1999; Teclai 2006).",Decreasing,"The African Wild Ass occurs in Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Somalia; some animals may persist in Djibouti, Sudan and Egypt, but there is no recent information available (Moehlman <em>et al.</em> in press). Yalden <em>et al</em>. (1996) recorded them to 1,500 m in Ethiopia.<br/><br/>Two subspecies are recognized. The Nubian Wild Ass, <em>E. a. africanus</em>, lived in the Nubian desert of north-eastern Sudan, from east of the Nile River to the shores of the Red Sea, and south to the Atbara River and into northern Eritrea. During aerial flights in the 1970s, wild asses were seen in the Barka Valley of Eritrea and in the border area between Eritrea and the Sudan. The Somali Wild Ass, <em>E. a. somalicus</em>, was found in the Denkelia region of Eritrea, the Danakil Desert and the Awash River Valley in the Afar region of north-eastern Ethiopia, western Djibouti, and into the Ogaden region of eastern Ethiopia. In Somalia, they ranged from Meit and Erigavo in the north to the Nugaal Valley, and as far south as the Shebele River (Moehlman 2002; Moehlman <em>et al</em>. in press).<br/><br/>The current range of the African Wild Ass (in Ethiopia and Eritrea) is approximately 15,000 km². DNA extracted from faecal samples collected from animals in Eritrea and Ethiopia resulted in the identification of five mitochondrial DNA haplotypes: one haplotype (group of polymorphisms) specific to the Eritrean population (haplotype D); one haplotype specific to the Ethiopian population (E); and three shared haplotypes (A, B, and C). These results suggest that there is and/or has been gene flow between the subpopulations (Afrera, Serdo) in Ethiopia and the population in Eritrea (Oakenfull <em>et al</em>. 2002).",The African Wild Ass is hunted for food and medicinal products. It is only hunted at the subsistence level.,Terrestrial,"Listed on CITES Appendix I. In Ethiopia, the Yangudi-Rassa National Park (4,731 km²) and the Mille-Serdo Wild Ass Reserve (8,766 km²) were established in 1969. However, the former has never been formally gazetted, and both areas are utilized by large numbers of pastoralists and their livestock. These areas are remote and extremely arid, and the Ethiopian Wildlife Conservation Organization (EWCO) has not had sufficient funds or personnel for appropriate management (Kebede 1999). In Eritrea, the government designated the African wild ass area between the Buri Peninsula and the Dalool Depression as a high-priority area for conservation protection as a nature reserve. In both Eritrea and Ethiopia, research and conservation programmes (Ministry of Agriculture and EWCA) have been critical for sustaining African Wild Ass populations by involving local pastoralists in their conservation. There are no protected areas in the range of the species in Somalia. Populations of Somali Wild Ass are maintained in captivity (Moehlman 2002).<br/><br/>Recommended research and conservation actions, include:<br/><br/>1.

17583369,190871,Sotalia fluviatilis,Data Deficient,,2012,2010-04-09 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p><span lang=""EN-US"">The split of <em>Sotalia</em> into two species has conservation relevance. The Tucuxi can be considered the world's only exclusively freshwater delphinid. This endemism jeopardizes its persistence because its restricted habitat is shared with increasing human populations. Tucuxis are vulnerable to threats such as incidental mortality in fisheries, habitat deterioration and fragmentation of populations by dam construction (Reeves <span style=""font-style: italic;"">at al.</span> 2003). No formal assessment to evaluate the risks of population decline has been performed. Such assessment will require a better understanding of population structure so that population-specific abundance, non-natural mortality rates and other relevant parameters can be estimated and considered. <span lang=""EN-US"">Due to a lack of good data on these parameters, <em>Sotalia fluviatilis </em>is listed as Data Deficient. </span></p>","<p><span lang=""EN-US"">Tucuxis inhabit all three types of water of the Amazon basin: white water, clear water, and black water. Therefore, physical factors such as visibility and acidity appear not to affect their distribution directly.&#160; They seem to prefer the main channels of rivers and larger lakes where access is not limited by a narrow or shallow channel, while rapids and fast-moving turbulent water are avoided. Tucuxis also generally do not enter the flooded forest. They are mostly found within 50 m of the edges of rivers and channels (Martin <em>et al.</em> 2004). Similarly to the sympatric Boto, the Tucuxi shows a distinct preference for junctions of rivers and channels (da Silva and Best 1996, Leatherwood <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2000, Martin <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2004). The most preferred habitat is where a sediment-rich whitewater channel meets the low pH- carrying black water. The resultant mixing produces productive and obviously attractive conditions for dolphins (Martin <em>et al.</em> 2004). The large seasonal fluctuation in river levels (10m) influences the distribution of Tucuxis. They enter lake systems during periods of high water but leave these environments as the waters recede, thus avoiding entrapment. In the Peruvian Amazon, Tucuxis were not found in waters &lt;3m depth in rivers or &lt;1.8 m depth in lakes. </p>  <p>Individuals may occur in the same area year-round. Two tagged individuals in the Amazon were found within 5 km of the tagging site up to 1 year later (da Silva and Best 1994). A long-term photo-identification study revealed a maximum range for individuals of 130 km in Peru's Pacaya-Samiria Reserve (McGuire and Henningsen 2007). This relatively small range is probably due to limiting features such as small channels and seasonally shallow waters. According to McGuire (2002), encounter rates were highest in confluences, intermediate in lakes, and lowest in rivers and did not differ among seasons in the latter two. During the dry season, Tucuxis persisted longer in the confluences and occurred in higher densities than in any rainy or intermediate season; the reverse pattern was observed during high water.&#160; </p>  <p><em>Sotalia fluviatilis</em> occurs most often in groups of one to six individuals. Groups of more than nine animals are rarely observed (da Silva and Best 1994, Faustino and da Silva 2006). The composition of groups is unknown. Vidal <em>et al.</em> (1997) reported overall mean group size of 3.9 in the upper Amazon. Tucuxis were most frequently seen as singles or pairs in rivers and lakes of Peru's Pacaya-Samiria Reserve; seasonal differences in group size were non-significant (McGuire 2002). </p>  <p>Information on reproduction is sparse. Males attain sexual maturity at approximately 140cm and females at between 132 and 137cm (da Silva and Best 1996). In Brazil, gestation lasts about 11 months and calves are about 80 cm long at birth, which occurs primarily from September to November during the low-water period (da Silva and Best 1996, Flores and da Silva 2009). Neonate Tucuxi were observed in all seasons in the Peruvian Amazon, with a slight peak in encounter rates during high water (McGuire and Aliaga 2007).</p>  <p>At least 28 species of <span lang=""EN-US"">mostly small schooling fish belonging to 11 families are preyed upon by tucuxis in the Amazon region. The characoid family Curimatidae was represented in 52%, Sciaenidae in 39% and siluriforms in 54% of stomachs analysed (n = 29) (da Silva and Best 1994). During the dry season, fish concentrate in the main water bodies and thus are more vulnerable to predation. During the flood season, many species enter the floodplain and are largely out of reach of Tucuxis.</span></p>","<span lang=""EN-US"">There are no records of past or recent commercial fisheries for <em>Sotalia</em> spp. (IWC 2001). River dolphins in the Amazon region are threatened primarily by incidental mortality in fishing gear (IWC 2001). <em>Sotalia fluviatilis</em> consumes 14 of the 30 species of commercially exploited fish in the Amazon, and thus incidental captures during fishing are frequent (da Silva and Best 1994, 1996; Martin <em>et al.</em> 2004). In one study in the central Amazon of Brazil, 74% of 34 Tucuxis examined had been killed in gill nets and 15% in seine nets (da Silva and Best 1985). By-catch in fishing gear, caused by the proliferation of gill nets, and some evidence of poisoning by commercial fishermen, seem to be the main conservation threats to Tucuxis in Peru (Reeves <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 1999).<span lang=""EN-US""><br/><br/>Other potentially important threats are oil spills, boat strikes, chemical and noise pollution, overfishing of prey, and damming of rivers for hydroelectric projects (da Silva and Best 1994, Denkinger 2001, McGuire 2002). Dams can interrupt gene flow and create isolated groups of dolphins with reduced genetic variability and lowered demographic resilience. <span lang=""EN-US"">The use of pesticides banned in many countries continues to be common in some parts of South America (PNUMA 2002). Mercury is used to refine fluvial gold and then, like the pesticides, enters aquatic food webs. Dams, in addition to fragmenting dolphin populations, can have serious effects on migratory fish populations on which Tucuxis feed (such as some siluriform fishes) (da Silva and Best 1994). The increased use of outboard engines and illegal fishing with explosives are also sources of concern in parts of these dolphins' range (e.g. Utreras <em>et al.</em> 2001, Zapata-Rios and Utreras 2004).<span lang=""EN-US""><br/><br/>Although freshwater dolphins have been protected by superstitions in parts of Amazonia (Leatherwood and Reeves 1997), in Colombia and Brazil there was and may still be a small market for the eyes, teeth and reproductive organs of dolphins, used as love charms or aphrodisiacs when prepared in a special manner (da Silva and Best 1994, 1996; Trujillo and Diazgranados 2002; Alves and Rosa 2008). According to V. da Silva (pers. comm.), this market is no longer a significant threat in the Brazilian Amazon, although according to M. Borobia (in IWC 2007) the practice of selling dolphin parts continues in at least some local areas. However, according to V. Da Silva (pers. comm.), fishermen in the central Amazon do not kill Tucuxi deliberately or use parts of its body as love charm. Teeth, eyes and body parts are from <em>S. guianensis</em>, most captured accidentally in the Para coast. Eyes of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">S. guianensis</span>, killed in the nets at the Amazon estuary are often sold in the markets as Boto eyes. Recent molecular analyses have shown that a high proportion of dolphin products sold as amulets and love charms are derived from Guiana dolphins (<em>S. guianensis</em>), even in the Amazon region (Cunha and Solé- Cava 2007, Gravena <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008, Sholl <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008).<span lang=""EN-US""><br/><br/>Recently, Loch <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> (2009) found two Tucuxis and one Boto wounded by perforating and cutting objects, probably harpoons and machetes. Such kills indicate potential conflicts with locals using tucuxi and boto as bait in a catfish fishery (V. da Silva, pers. comm.). Trujillo and Diazgranados (2002) reported one death by harpooning in the Colombian Amazon, in a ten-year monitoring period.</span></span>","To date, there is no information on the population structure of <em>S. fluviatilis</em>. The only data available suggest that the species has moderate to high genetic diversity, since 12 individuals from the same location in the central Brazilian Amazon had five different control region haplotypes (Cunha <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2005), and 21 dolphins from the Peruvian, Colombian and Brazilian Amazon had 13 haplotypes (combining the control region and ND2, Caballero <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2007). Microsatellite variation is also larger in <em>S. fluviatilis </em>(H = 0.531) than in <em>S. guianensis </em>(H = 0.364; Cunha and Watts 2007). The reason for a higher level of genetic variation in <em>S. fluviatilis</em>, in spite of its probably smaller population size, remains to be determined. <span lang=""EN-US"">There are no estimates of the total population size for <em>S. fluviatilis</em>, though it appears to be relatively abundant throughout most of its range (Flores and da Silva 2009). Local estimates of relative abundance exist for some areas. <span lang=""EN-US"">In the Amazon drainage, an average density (encounter rate) of approximately 1.1 dolphins/km of river was estimated between Manaus and Tefé in the Solimões River (Magnusson <em>et al.</em> 1980). Four boat surveys of about 1,525 km each, from Manaus to Letícia, resulted in a mean estimate of 768 (± 104.7 SD) dolphins per trip or 1.02 individuals/km² (da Silva and Best 1994). More recently, mean density along the margins of main rivers in the central Amazon,  Brazil (1,320 km of strip survey) was estimated at 3.2 individuals/km². About 54% of the individuals were found within 50 m of the edge of rivers and channels (Martin <em>et al.</em> 2004). Faustino and da Silva (2006) recorded on average 24 Tucuxis/km in the Mamirauá System, Central Amazon. Higher densities were found in deeper channels with high turbulence and productivity.<span lang=""EN-US""><br/><br/>About 350 Tucuxis were estimated to inhabit the Samiria River system in Peru (Leatherwood 1996). Recent studies indicate that encounter rates in this area were within the range for these dolphins elsewhere in South America and that population numbers were stable over 10 years between 1991 and 2000 (McGuire 2002). Mean encounter rates in the Peruvian Amazon were 0.01-080 individuals/km in rivers and 0.05-2.17 individuals/km² in lakes (28 surveys over a four-year time period; McGuire 2002). The species is reportedly common in Colombia in the Loretoyacu River, in the Tarapoto River and in the El Correo Lake system (da Silva and Best 1994). Vidal <em>et al.</em> (1997) estimated that in 1993 there were 409 Tucuxis (CV=13%) along 120 km of the Amazon River bordering Colombia, Peru, and Brazil. Density (dolphins/km²) was highest in lakes (8.6), followed by areas along main banks (2.8) and around islands (2.0)<span lang=""EN-US"">. Those estimates of density or abundance in small portions of the range are of limited use for assessment of the conservation status of the species as a whole. </span></span>",Unknown,"<p><span lang=""EN-US"">Tucuxis are found in the Amazon drainage as far inland as southern Peru, eastern Ecuador, and southeastern Colombia. They occur in the main tributaries of the Amazon/Solimões River basin and they cross international boundaries in areas such as Leticia, between Brazil and Colombia. The species does not occur in the Beni/Mamoré river basin in Bolivia nor in the upper Rio Negro. Its putative presence in the Orinoco is controversial because of a stretch of rapids and waterfalls that are suspected to block the species movements to this area (Flores and da Silva 2009). <span lang=""EN-US"">During the flood season, Tucuxis may move into smaller tributaries, but apparently they do not move into the inundated forest to feed (as botos, <em>Inia geoffrensis</em>, often do), staying mainly in the main river channels, tributaries and lakes (da Silva and Best 1996).

The small areas of habitat where it occurs (42.4 km² in Rungwe-Kitulo and ~25 km² in Ndundulu), and the species' patchy distribution in Rungwe-Kitulo give grounds for considerable conservation concern. Totalling 68 km², its area of occupancy (AOO) is below the 500 km² upper threshold for an Endangered listing under criterion B2. At 3,518 km², the taxon’s extent of occurrence (EOO) also meets the threshold for criterion B1. In addition, the habitat is fragmented and remote sensing analyses of forest loss in Rungwe-Kitulo indicate a decline over the last 30 years, which although now slowing, is continuing. The management of Mt Rungwe is currently dependent on funds from the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS). Forest loss has been reduced but continues in key areas. Persistent hunting of these monkeys across Rungwe-Kitulo (and possibly Ndundulu) – especially individuals which raid crops – as well as the precarious nature of the small population in Ndundulu, where logging, charcoal making and unmanaged resource extraction are commonplace, lead us to project a continuing decline in AOO, area, extent and quality of habitat, and the number of mature individuals remaining. As a consequence, the species is here listed as EN B1ab+2ab.</p>","Habitat ranges from degraded montane and upper montane forest from 1,700–2,150 m in Rungwe-Kitulo (Davenport <em>et al</em>. 2006, 2008, Bracebridge <em>et al.</em> 2011, 2012) to submontane forest in Ndundulu (Davenport and Jones 2005, Jones <em>et al. </em>2005). In Rungwe-Kitulo, the canopy is often broken and between 10 and 30 m with emergents reaching 35 m. Kipunji prefers steep-sided gullies and valley edges and is rarely found far from streams (Davenport 2013). Ridges and open areas are generally avoided and the animals are not territorial (De Luca <em>et al.</em> 2010). The forest was much reduced by logging from 1960s to 1980s (Lovett 1986, McKone and Walzem 1994, Machaga <em>et al.</em> 2004, Davenport 2005, 2006). Thick undergrowth is typical, with the tree fern <em>Cyathea manniana,</em> wild banana <em>Ensete ventricosum</em>, and large stands of bamboo <em>Sinarundinaria alpina</em> common in the south and southeast of Mt Rungwe and the northwest of Livingstone. The upper limits of this distribution are likely due to the floristic changes at around 2,000–2,200m asl, where bamboo <em>Sinarundinaria alpina</em>, often interspersed with <em>Hagenia abyssinica</em> or <em>Podocarpus latifolius,</em> dominate (Bracebridge <em>et al. </em>2011). The species rarely frequents the bamboo and leaves the forest only to raid nearby crops, especially maize. In southern Mt Rungwe, annual rainfall ranges from <em>ca</em> 185–280 cm and there is an indistinct and short dry season from June to October. In Ndundulu, the <em>Parinari excelsa</em>-dominant forest is undisturbed and the canopy is unbroken, reaching heights of 40–50 m. When comparing predictions from an interpolation analysis for a habitat suitability model with the EOO, the vast majority of the most suitable areas in Rungwe-Kitulo&#160;were already occupied by Kipunji (Bracebridge <em>et al.</em> 2011). The best forest for Kipunji would be at mid to lower altitude with a closed canopy. However, as much of Rungwe-Kitulo contains heterogeneous forest, reflecting a history of disturbance (Davenport <em>et al.</em> 2006, Davenport, 2009), forest is often fragmented and contains a mix of primary, secondary and regenerating forest. This suggests that while not optimal, Kipunji can tolerate disturbed habitat reasonably well (Bracebridge <em>et al</em>. 2011).","The Rungwe-Kitulo forests are degraded. Logging, charcoal making, illegal hunting and unmanaged resource extraction have long been commonplace (Machaga <em>et al.</em> 2004, Davenport 2005, 2006). The narrow Bujingijila corridor linking Mt Rungwe Nature Reserve to Livingstone Forest in Kitulo National Park, and the corridors joining the northern and southern sections of Livingstone, are encroached by farmers and degraded (Davenport 2005, Mwakilema and Davenport 2005). Subpopulations are therefore fragmented even within the same forest protected area. Kipunji is hunted with log traps and with also with dogs (Davenport 2005, 2006), mainly as retribution for the crop-raiding of maize (and the leaves of beans and potatoes) and primarily from January to April. However, the monkey is also occasionally hunted for food. Although Ndundulu Forest is in good condition and largely undisturbed, the species is present there in low numbers (Davenport<em> et al.</em> 2008) and the reasons for this are unclear (Marshall <em>et al. </em>2015). Both Kilombero and Mt Rungwe Nature Reserves lack management resources.","Surveys totalling 2,864 hours and covering 3,456 km of transect were undertaken by Davenport <em>et al</em>. (2008) to determine distribution and group numbers. In addition, 772 hours of simultaneous multi-group observational follows in Rungwe-Kitulo and Ndundulu forests enabled 209 total counts to be carried out. Davenport <em>et al.</em> (2008) estimated some 1,042 individuals in Rungwe-Kitulo, ranging from 25 to 39 individuals per group (µ = 30.65; SE = 0.62; n = 34), and 75 individuals in Ndundulu, ranging from 15 to 25 individuals per group (µ = 18.75; SE = 2.39; n = 4). The total Kipunji population was thus estimated to be 1,117 animals in 38 groups (µ = 29.39; SE = 0.85; n = 38). The Ndundulu population is restricted and the Rungwe-Kitulo population is highly fragmented with isolated subpopulations remaining in degraded habitat (Davenport<em> et al.</em> 2008). Kipunji densities appear to be over three times greater in the secondary forests of Rungwe-Kitulo than in the primary forests of the Udzungwa population (Davenport <em>et al</em>. 2008), which is likely an effect of forest quality, but also perhaps competition with other diurnal primates not present in Rungwe-Livingstone (Bracebridge <em>et al.</em> 2011).",Decreasing,"A Tanzanian endemic known from two populations separated by <em>ca</em> 350 km of non-forested, agricultural land. One population is at 1,750–2,450 m asl in 12.4 km² of Rungwe-Kitulo Forest (Davenport <em>et al. </em>2008) in the Southern Highlands of south-western Tanzania (09.12º-09.18ºS, 33.67º-33.92ºE). The Rungwe-Kitulo Forest includes Mt Rungwe Nature Reserve (150 km²) and the Livingstone Forest (191 km²), which lies within the 412 km² Kitulo National Park (Davenport 2002, Davenport and Bytebier 2004, Davenport <em>et al</em>. 2005, 2006, 2008). Mt Rungwe and Livingstone Forest (in Kitulo) are connected by the Bujingijila Corridor, a 2-km wide degraded forest connection (Davenport 2005, 2006, Mwakilema and Davenport 2005). The Kipunji inhabits the wetter forest of south Mt Rungwe and isolated groups are scattered in the north and south of Livingstone Forest (Davenport <em>et al. </em>2006, 2008, Bracebridge <em>et al. </em>2011).  The other population of <em>R. kipunji </em>is found at 1,300–1,750 m asl in the Vikongwa Valley, Ndundulu Forest (07.67º-07.85ºS, 35.17º-36.83ºE; <em>ca</em> 180 km of closed forest), in the Kilombero Nature Reserve in the Udzungwa Mountains, south-central Tanzania (Jones<em> et al</em>. 2015). The area known to be occupied by the species in the Ndundulu Forest is approximately 25 km² (Davenport pers obs. in Marshall <em>et al.</em> 2015) and Kipunji density is low. Research indicates that the animal is absent from the contiguous Udzungwa Mountains National Park (Davenport <em>et al.</em> 2008, Marshall <em>et al.</em> 2015). The species' area of occupancy (AOO) is estimated to be 42.4 km² in Rungwe-Kitulo (Bracebridge <em>et al.</em> 2011) and ~25 km² in Ndundulu (Davenport pers. obs. in Marshall <em>et al.</em> 2015), with a combined total AOO of only 67.5 km².","<p>Occasionally hunted for food.

However, only the national park has independent management activities and resources, and they remain limited, especially in the forest. The focus of current Kipunji conservation work is the protection and restoration of the montane habitats of Mt Rungwe, especially the forest connections, such as the (2.1 km²) Bujingijila corridor (Davenport 2006, Bracebridge <em>et al.</em> 2011). Protecting corridors is of the highest priority for the conservation of this genus/species and Bujingijila could provide habitat for an additional 88 Kipunji (8% population increase), using density estimates from the 2008 census (Bracebridge <em>et al</em>. 2013). It also has the benefit of reconnecting the Mt Rungwe and Kitulo kipunji subpopulations.&#160;Furthermore, conservation management, while focusing on promoting old growth forest, should also consider populations of some important pioneer tree species such as <em>Macaranga capensis</em>, both in the forest and in reforestation schemes outside the species’ current Area of Occupancy (Bracebridge <em>et al</em>. 2012).</p><p>Kipunji is being used as a 'flagship species' by WCS's long-term Southern Highlands Conservation Program in and around Rungwe-Kitulo, especially in education and awareness raising activities, and as part of a long-term monitoring programme.

22158006,41783,Axis axis,Least Concern,,2015,2014-11-14 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Chital is listed as Least Concern because it occurs over a very wide range within which there are many large subpopulations. Although it is still declining in some sites (particularly outside protected areas), at the species level any such declines are at nowhere near the rate required to qualify for listing even as Near Threatened. Historical declines may have been higher, but these occurred outside of the three generation window (&lt;30 years) used for purposes of applying Red List Criteria. Listing as Least Concern recognizes that there are two significant conservation issues with this species. Firstly, current densities are mostly well below what the habitat could support (and have been for decades), and secondly, the long-term persistence of nearly all subpopulations is dependent upon well secured protected areas: anything which caused the breakdown of current effective protection would allow a rapid rise in hunting levels and perhaps of domestic stock-grazing. These are the factors with which current Chital numbers are in an uneasy and fragile relationship. If such changes were to occur across a significant part of the range, reassessment of Red List status would be required: without effective protection, Chital’s population trend would emulate that of Eld's Deer <em>Rucervus eldii</em>, another herding deer of rather open forests, but with a geographic range covering areas without long-standing effective protected areas. Regular monitoring of the status of Chital subpopulations would be prudent for this species.","Chital thrive in a variety of habitats, but avoid extremes such as dense moist (evergreen) forests and open semi-desert or desert. Moist and dry deciduous forest areas, especially adjoining dry thorn scrub or grasslands, appear to be optimal, and highest densities of Chital are reported from these habitats. Short grasslands of the terai, swampy meadows and glades adjoining forest areas, coastal dry evergreen forests, mixed forests or plantations with Teak Tectona grandis and Sal Shorea robusta are also used, and indeed over much of northern and southern India, its distribution closely matches that of Sal and Teak, respectively (Raman 2013). Chital is particularly frequent in grassland–forest interface, edge, and other ecotones (Krishnan 1972). Eisenberg and Seidensticker (1976) opined that dry deciduous habitats with scrub is the favoured habitat, while Karanth and Sunquist (1992) found mixed forests with teak plantations, moist deciduous patches and swampy grasslands to support high abundance of Chital. Kumar (2010) found that well-watered and well-protected moist deciduous forest patches in gently undulating terrain supported high Chital densities. Short grasslands are important because they provide little cover for predators such as Tiger <em>Panthera tigris</em> (Moe and Wegge 1994). The introduced subpopulation in Andaman Islands inhabits evergreen forests (Sankar and Acharya 2004) but native subpopulations are absent from the rainforest areas of the mainland. They tend to be only visitors to dense forests, to those adjoining more open habitats. Riverine forests within the Bardia National Park in lowland Nepal are highly used by the deer for shade and cover during the dry season. The forest also provides good foraging with regard to fallen fruit and leaves that are high in nutrients needed by the deer. Four factors were identified by Schaller (1967) as delineating Chital’s distribution: (1) the need for water; (2) the need for shade; (3) an avoidance of high, rugged terrain; and (4) a preference for grass as forage. Although several observers have noted that Chital occurs mostly in flat areas and avoids hills and slopes (Schaller 1967, Khan 1996), this may not hold in areas where preferred habitats or forage is also available on slopes (Raman 2013, Kumar 2010). It occurs in both hilly and flatter terrain, mainly the latter, in the Terai Arc Landscape of India (Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004). In the Siwalik hills, Bhat and Rawat (1995) found that Chital preferred slopes of 11–30°, while slopes exceeding 30° were used less. Also, use of south, southeast, and east aspects was higher than of north, northeast, northwest, and west aspects, reflecting the warmer environment of the former aspects. There was no difference in average Chital density in the hills and plains (Bhat and Rawat 1995). A study of coffee estates around Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary, India, recorded Chital widely, including in coffee areas up to 14 km of the sanctuary’s boundary (Bali <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>Habitat use varies seasonally, reflecting food availability. Chital uses more wooded habitat during the cool-dry season and early summer (November to May), where fallen fruit, leaf litter, and browse are available. In open grassland and tropical dry thorn forest, Chital density increases with the onset of monsoon rains and flush of plant growth (Mishra 1982, Moe and Wegge 1994, Khan 1996, Raman <em>et al</em>. 1996). In areas of their distribution with a mosaic of forest and grassland habitats, seasonal patterns in habitat use may be complex. In the Himalayan terai, Chital use of habitats with high grass availability increased substantially in the weeks following cutting and burning of grasses in January–February, attributed to fresh flush of grass growth after the burns and with the onset pre-monsoon and monsoon rains nearly two months later (Mishra 1982; Moe and Wegge 1994, 1997). Similar behaviour has been reported from the grasslands of Bandipur Tiger Reserve (Johnsingh 1983).<br/><br/>Chital easily habituates to human presence, and herds often congregate in open areas near habitation or forest camps to spend the night, possibly due to greater safety from predators and poachers that shy away from these areas (Raman 2013).<br/><br/>Chital eats a wide variety of plants: about 160–190 have been recorded from across the species' range. It is predominantly a grazer but consumes more fallen leaves, flowers and fruits in winter/dry season (Sankar 1994, Sankar and Acharya 2004, Raman 2013). In addition to plant soft matter, crabs (in the Sunderbans; Stanford 1951), mushrooms (in Nepal; Moe and Wegge 1994) and rarely, bark (Raman <em>et al</em>. 1996) are eaten. Close to human habitation, rubbish and even human faeces are occasionally taken (Raman <em>et al</em>. 1996). Antler and bone chewing is also common. In Wilpattu, Sri Lanka, all age and sex classes are osteophagous, but such feeding was more common in velvet-antlered males, doubtless reflecting mineral needs during antler growth and mineralisation (Barrette 1985). Chital usually drinks water once a day, more frequently in summer. This restricts them to forest tracts with assured presence of water, even if only widely scattered.<br/><br/>In lowland Nepal, an individual’s total range incorporates a core area of about 32 hectares surrounded by foraging and cover areas of about 140 ha for females and 195 ha for males (Moe and Wegge 1994). Variation in range size occurs with site, season, sex and age of the animal. The basic social unit is a matriarchal family group, normally consisting of an adult female, her offspring from the previous year, and a fawn (Ables 1974). The usual herd is composed of two or more such family units and is often accompanied by individual deer of mixed sex and age-classes. Chital exhibits a fission-fusion system, or fluid group formation and dissolution (Schaller 1967, Mishra 1982, Barette 1991). Group composition changes frequently during feeding periods, during the rut when males frequently join groups of females (Schaller 1967), and while fleeing from predators (Dinerstein 1980). These social groupings of Chital do not remain permanent (Schaller 1967, Eisenberg and Lockhart 1972). Groups may number up to 150 or more individuals (De and Spillit 1966, Schaller 1967, Eisenberg and Lockhart 1972, Krishnan 1972, Fuchs 1977, Karanth and Sunquist 1992), sometimes even more: N.S. Kumar (pers. comm. 2008) counted 211 in one group during rainy season in Nagarahole and 203 in one group at Pench-Maharashtra near a water reservoir in summer. Measured sex ratios have all been biased towards females (Sankar and Acharya 2004 and references therein). Pariwakam (2006) observed nearly 10,500 Chital in Bandipur and estimated the proportion of Chital in different age and sex classes as stags 27%, does 57% and fawns 16%. In neighbouring Nagarahole, age-sex categories of Chital were adult stags 26%, adult does 36%, yearling males 8%, yearling females 9% and young 21% (Karanth and Sunquist 1992). Breeding can occur at any time of year but there is some peaking at any given locality (Sankar and Acharya 2004 and references therein). Heavy mortality of fawns in early weeks has been observed by several workers and fawn survival appears to be a key determinant of Chital population growth (Schaller 1967). Schaller (1967) estimated an annual fawn mortality of 48% in Kanha, Sharathchandra, and Gadgil (1975) estimated a constant monthly mortality of 26% over first nine months in Bandipur, Raman (1996) estimated a mean monthly mortality of 9.7% in Guindy. Pariwakam (2006) for the first time used a rigorous photographic capture-recapture approach to estimate the fawn mortality rate, and found it to be 66% over a six week study period in Bandipur. Further information on sociality and breeding is synthesised by Sankar and Acharya (2004) and by Raman (2013). Over a 10-year time period, Karanth and Kumar (unpublished data) have observed annual fluctuations in the Chital subpopulations in Nagarahole and Bandipur ranging between population densities of 10 to 40 animals per km<sup>2</sup>.<br/><br/>Chital is a prolific breeder, as documented by several empirical studies of the speed of increase by newly introduced subpopulations or in those where a factor restraining subpopulations was removed (Raman 2013 and references therein). In Bhadra, following the departure from the park of human settlements and consequent removal of anthropogenic pressures on Chital and habitats, Chital subpopulations bounced back by nearly seven times in fewer than four years (K.U. Karanth and N.S. Kumar unpublished data). Karanth <em>et al</em>. (1999) earlier documented their empirical observations of the recovery of Chital subpopulations in Nagarahole. This and its diverse diet and habitats allow high density where threats are controlled. It is even considered to be a pest in the Andamans (Banerji 1955).<br/><br/>The main causes of death are predation, diseases and accidents. Occasionally, stags kill each other when fighting (Sankar and Acharya 2004 and references therein). Predation is by far the major cause of Chital mortality. Older Chital stags are more susceptible to it than are younger stags (Johnsingh 1983, Patel 1992, Karanth and Sunquist 1995). This may be due to their being less vigilant during rut, to their separation from the group after the rut, or to weakening from injuries from conflicts. In Kanha, Chital remains were found in about 52% of Tiger faeces and 59% of Leopard <em>Panthera pardus</em> faeces analysed (Schaller 1967). In Bandipur, Chital is the most important prey in terms of the biomass taken by Dhole (78%), Leopard (55%) and Tiger (19%; Andheria <em>et al</em>. 2007). Even in terms of the relative number of individuals taken, Chital is the predominant prey among the three large sympatric predators (Tigers about 33%, Leopards about 39% and Dholes about 73% in Bandipur; Andheria <em>et al</em>. 2007). In adjoining Nagarahole remains were found in about 31% of Tiger faeces, 44% of Leopard faeces, and 50% of Dhole faeces (Karanth and Sunquist 1995). In Sariska, around 54% of the faeces of Tiger and 21% of Leopard faeces contained Chital remains (Sankar 1994). Chital remains were found in about 53% of Tiger faeces in Pench (Biswas and Sankar 2002) and 61% of Tiger faeces in Ranthambore (Bagchi <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>Each Chital spends a major portion of its life in foraging, resting, and wandering within its range, with the relative extent of these activities determined by season (Schaller 1967). In a day, peak feeding times are around dawn and dusk. There are usually two major resting periods, before dawn and mid-day (Sankar and Acharya 2004).<br/><br/>Considerable further detail on ecology, drawn from the relative wealth of studies on the species, with each item precisely referenced to source, is provided by Raman (2013).","There are presently no major global-level threats to Chital, although densities are widely below ecological carrying capacity, through hunting and competition with domestic livestock. There were substantial declines and local extinctions, driven by hunting for meat, extermination as an agricultural pest, and habitat conversion, particularly during British rule of India and adjacent countries, and immediately after independence (Raman 2013). Fewer than 20 years after independence, Schaller (1967) wrote that ""...the species has declined drastically throughout its range in India, and is now only locally abundant in some sanctuaries and forest tracts. The remaining populations are highly vulnerable to poaching, habitat destruction, and other forms of decimation"". The habitat loss of the past few centuries means that subpopulations are now rather fragmented. Now, in India, most subpopulations appear secure within the modern protected area network (Raman 2013), but those outside (now highly localised) are under rapid decline due to habitat conversion and extensive hunting (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). A relaxation of protection can lead to rapid decreases. For example, Chital used to be numerically the most abundant large herbivore in the Wilpattu National Park (Sri Lanka), but numbers declined significantly due to poaching which increased during management breakdown during the civil war, when its meat was even being sold next to the park. Poaching has also risen, for the same reason, in several other national parks in Sri Lanka (Santiapillai and Wijeyamohan 2003). Where not prevented by effective conservation measures (active protection through patrolling and law enforcement, backed up by adequate awareness), people avidly hunt and poach Chital throughout their Indian range (Madhusudan and Karanth 2000,&#160;Madhusudan and Karanth&#160;2002, Sankar and Acharya 2004, Bali <em>et al</em>. 2007) and there are occasional cases in even the best secured protected areas such as Corbett Tiger Reserve (Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004). Many protected areas are well enough secured that the species has thrived well and, is now locally abundant (Sankar and Acharya 2004) and in such areas poaching of Chital is a more serious conservation problem for the large predators (every deer poached reduces predators’ food base; Karanth <em>et al</em>. 2004) than it is for Chital itself. In many other protected areas (especially those with a lower public profile) and for areas outside the conservation system, subpopulations are severely restrained by hunting. For example, densities in Bhadra Tiger Reserve are very low by comparison with what the habitat should support because of poaching with snares, dogs and shotguns, and also grazing competition with domestic stock (Jathanna <em>et al</em>. 2003), and the density was 87% lower in a heavily hunted area of Nagarahole National Park than in a well secured area (Madhusudan and Karanth 2000, 2002). Even though all hunting is illegal in this protected area, protection efficacy is uneven across the area. The Chital is one of the two most commonly hunted mammal species in the national park, partly because various facets of its behaviour and ecology such as herding behaviour and attachment to open habitat allow its ready detection and killing, and quick entry and exit by poachers. It is therefore exposed to far higher hunting pressure than are the ungulates which are solitary and spend much time in dense cover (Madhusudan and Karanth 2002). Poaching is probably operative to a greater or lesser extent in most subpopulations, but at low enough levels that recent decades have not seen, with Chital, the frequent local extirpations from areas of prime habitat of earlier decades.<br/><br/>The most serious threat, in areas where poaching and habitat conversion are well controlled, is the reduction in carrying capacity through competition with livestock, especially during the pinch season as observed in Sariska (Sankar 1994); Chital and livestock are known to have dietary overlap (Raman 2013). The problem has been documented almost throughout Chital’s range but awareness that it is a problem at all remains so low that it is not even recognised as a key conservation issue in many protected areas (e.g. Mathai 1999). In Gir Lion Sanctuary and National Park, Chital population density increased 14-fold from 3.57 animals per km<sup>2</sup> in 1970–1971 (Berwick 1974) to 50.8 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in 1989 (Khan 1996, Khan <em>et al</em>. 1996). This was attributed to the rapid and complete removal of pastoral settlements, their livestock, and a total ban on several thousand migratory livestock. Dung densities of Chital and livestock were also negatively correlated in Gir, indicating avoidance and possible competitive interaction between the species. With removal of human impact and increase in forage availability, Chital subpopulations increased, as testified by higher Chital densities in the vicinity of abandoned settlements (nesses; Sharma and Johnsingh 1995). Similarly, in Bardia National Park (Nepal), protection from livestock grazing (and logging) in 1975 increased measured Chital subpopulations from 30–34 per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in 1977 (Dinerstein 1980) to over 200 per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in the early 1990s (Naess and Andersen 1993, Moe and Wegge 1994). In Bandipur Tiger Reserve, mean densities of Chital were 11 times higher in livestock-free areas than in adjacent livestock-grazed areas. In shared grazing areas, these Chital densities declined sharply with increasing livestock densities. In the studied grazed area, halving the livestock density allowed an increase in Chital density by a factor of five (Madhusudan 2004). Threats to southern India’s forest ungulates by competition with domestic stock grazing within protected areas are exacerbated where dung is collected for export to adjacent coffee areas. Fuel wood removal may also be at levels sufficient to disrupt nutrient cycles of the habitat (Madhusudan 2005). All these pressures interact to have, overall, a major depression of Chital densities. In Bhadra, following the departure from the park of human settlements and consequent removal of anthropogenic pressures on Chital and habitats, Chital subpopulations bounced back by nearly seven times in fewer than four years (Karanth and Kumar unpublished data). Karanth <em>et al</em>. (1999) earlier documented their empirical observations of the recovery of Chital subpopulations in Nagarahole.<br/><br/>Chital are susceptible to livestock-borne diseases such as rinderpest (Schaller 1967) and foot-and-mouth disease (Sankar 1994) but the current population is too widespread for these to rank as potential global-level threats. Accidents, especially from speeding vehicles, are a cause of Chital mortality but occur rarely within protected areas and cannot be significant at the global level. Many Indian forest areas are severely encroached by exotics such as <em>Lantana camara</em>, <em>Parthenium</em> spp. and <em>Chromolaena odorata</em> (= <em>Eupatorium odoratum</em>), and these are suspected to effect major changes to forest structure (Hiremath and Sundaram 2005): but their effects on Chital warrants further study. Wild-ranging domestic dogs are also likely to be a problem (Raman 2013), but no study quantifying their effects has been traced. There are no predictable threats to the Sundarbans subpopulation of Bangladesh, but as a low-lying area extreme weather events might cause episodic major population removal, as happened with hurricane Sidr in November 2007 (Md Anwarul Islam <em>in litt</em>. 2008).","Chital declined drastically throughout its range up until the first two-thirds of the 20th century (see under Major Threats). Karanth<em> et al. </em>(2010) documented an estimated average extinction rate of 45% over the last 50 years in the Indian sub-continent. It is however ""locally"" abundant in well protected parts of its range in mixes deciduous habitats. In India it occurs in 123 protected areas and forest tracts (National Wildlife Database, Wildlife Institute of India in Sankar and Acharya 2004). There are some large subpopulations in Nepal (e.g. Moe and Wegge 1994) where the population is probably currently stable and is anticipated to remain so in the immediate future (Hem Sagar Baral <em>in litt</em>. 2008). Thousands survive in the Sundarbans mangrove forest, Bangladesh, and there are a few introducedsub populations on coastal islands in the south (Md Anwarul Islam <em>in litt</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>The reported ecological densities of Chital mostly fall within three to 50 animals per km<sup>2</sup> in India: Bhadra Tiger Reserve, 4.51 +/- 1.05 (SE) per&#160;km<sup>2&#160;</sup>(Jathanna <em>et al</em>. 2003); Madhya Pradesh Pench National Park dry deciduous forest, 51.3 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Nichols 2000); Kanha moist deciduous forest, 49.7 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Nichols 2000); Nagarahole moist deciduous forest, 50.6 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Sunquist 1992); Bandipur dry deciduous forest, 20.1 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Nichols 2000); Tadoba-Andhari dry deciduous forest, 3.2 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Kumar 2005); Maharashtra Pench dry deciduous forest, 5.8 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Kumar 2005); Ranthambore semi-arid dry deciduous forest, 38.4 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Kumar 2000); BRT mixed deciduous forest, 9.4 animals per km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth 2012); Dandeli-Anshi mix of evergreen and deciduous forest, 0.6 animals per km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth 2012); Panna dry deciduous forest, 10.2 animals per km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Chundawat and Karanth unpublished data); Kawal dry deciduous forset two animals per km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Siddique 2010),&#160;and Gir semi-arid dry deciduous forest, 50.8 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Khan <em>et al</em>. 1996). Some parts of the well-protected areas in Nagarahole and Bandipur are known to harbour densities as high as 80–100 Chital per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Kumar 2010). Humar (2010) observed high spatial variation in the abundance of Chital in the 1,500 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;of Nagarahole-Bandipur National Parks, which ranged between zero to 100 animals per km<sup>2</sup>. Kumar (2010) also found that Chital densities positively responded to higher levels of protection, forage quality, flat terrain and water availability.&#160;The highest population densities, of around 200 Chitals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>, are reported for the Bardia National Park, Nepal (Naess and Andersen 1993, Moe and Wegge 1994) and for the reintroducedsub population in Guindy National Park, southern India (Menon 1982, Raman <em>et al</em>. 1996). These high densities reflect habitat and food availability in the former area (Moe and Wegge 1994), and supplementary feeding and low predation in the latter (Raman <em>et al</em>. 1996). Population densities in marginal habitats tend to be lower (Raman 2013; K.U. Karanth and N.S. Kumar unpublished data). Chital is the most abundant ungulate in Nagarahole, and reaches higher densities in moist than in dry deciduous forests (Karanth and Sunquist 1992). The recorded Bhadra density is low, reflecting poaching and livestock grazing (Jathanna <em>et al</em>. 2003), and the population density is steadily increasing following removal of these pressures in 2003 (K.U. Karanth and N.S. Kumar unpublished data). A study at Nagarahole National Park compared an area which was only moderately hunted with a heavily hunted site. This found respective densities of 65 and 10 Chitals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Madhusudan and Karanth 2002).<br/><br/>The Chital is almost completely dependent on active protection. Were this to be removed, the species' status in the 1970s suggests that rapid declines would occur. Even now, a very large proportion of its range supports subpopulations at significantly lower densities than the habitat could support.<br/><br/>The only subpopulation in Europe is on the islands of Brijuni (off Istria, Croatia), but B. Krystufek (pers. comm. 2008) has traced no information on its current status. Information has not been sought for this account on introduced subpopulations elsewhere, because they do not contribute to assessing the species’ Red List status.",Unknown,"The Chital occurs over 8–30°N in India (including Sikkim), Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka (Grubb 2005, Raman 2013). The western distribution boundary is formed by eastern Rajasthan (e.g. Sariska, Ranthambore and Keoladeo Ghana) and Gujarat (e.g. Sasan Gir). The northern boundary runs along the bhabar-terai belt of the foothills of the Himalaya from Uttar Pradesh and Uttaranchal through Nepal, northern West Bengal and Sikkim to western Assam and the forested valleys of Bhutan below 1,100 m asl. The eastern boundary runs through western Assam (Golapara and Kamrup district as far east as the Dhunsiri River in Darrang district) to the Sunderbans of West Bengal (India) and Bangladesh. Sri Lanka is the southern limit (Gee 1964, Schaller 1967, Raman 2013). Chital occur throughout the rest of peninsular India sporadically in the forested areas (Sankar and Acharya 2004), but in Bangladesh, it now occurs only in the Sundarbans, having vanished from the central, northeast and southeast regions (Md Anwarul Islam in litt. 2008).<br/><br/>Chital has been introduced to the Andaman Islands (India, during 1925–1930; Banerji 1955), Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Brazil, Croatia (islands of Brijuni; Mitchell-Jones <em>et al</em>. 1999), Moldova, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Ukraine, Uruguay and the USA (California, Florida, Hawaiian Islands and Texas; Grubb 2005, Raman 2013). These introduced subpopulations have not been mapped. Not all introductions have succeeded: for example, some were introduced to west-central Slovenia (from the Brijuni islands) in the late 1940s or in 1950, but this introduction failed and is now therefore frequently reported as having been of Fallow Deer <em>Dama dama</em>. One male, shot on 12 October 1950 and now in the Natural History Museum of Slovenia, proves the identification (Krystufek 1999). Managed herds occur in parks throughout the native and introduced range and in many other areas.","Chital are hunted for food, sport, and a variety of other purposes. It is unclear as to the numbers of captive animals kept within the native range and even if such animals are used to supply the same markets as wild caught animals. Introduced subpopulations almost certainly do not supply the same markets as wild caught animals from the species native range.",Terrestrial,"Chital is protected under Schedule III of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act (1972) (Sankar and Acharya 2004) and under the Wildlife (Preservation) (Amendment) Act, 1974 of Bangladesh (Md Anwarul Islam <em>in litt</em>. 2008). It occurs in many protected areas. Legal protection as a species and a network of functioning protected areas are the two cornerstones of its current healthy conservation status. Subpopulations exceeding 20,000 Chital probably occur in and around a handful of conservation areas within India: the belt of about 3,000&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;between Koh river and Haldwani including the Corbett Tiger Reserve; the Gir Protected Area (about 1,400&#160;km<sup>2</sup>); Kanha Tiger Reserve (about 2,000&#160;km<sup>2</sup>); and the Nilgiris–Western Ghats sector including Nagarahole, Bandipur, and Mudumalai (about 5,000&#160;km<sup>2</sup>;&#160;Raman 2013). Protected areas support more Chitals than do non-protected areas in the Terai Arc Landscape of India, although there is not currently such a great difference in densities as with the grassland species (Barasingha <em>Rucervus duvaucelii</em> and Hog Deer <em>Axis porcinus</em>;<em>&#160;</em>Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004). Ongoing habitat conversion trends outside protected areas will continue to increase the relative proportion of the total Chital population that they hold, and the maintenance of an extensive network of functional protected areas will remain the foundation of this species’ healthy conservation status. Part of this responsibility is vigilance by staff and partners of illegal poaching, which takes place at varying levels in most of the species range. Some recent cases have involved high-profile public role models, such as actors, poaching Chital and these warrant heavy court penalties. There is a strong case for prevention of livestock grazing in protected areas which hold Chital, partly to reduce risks of disease transmission, but mostly to prevent artificially low densities of Chital being forced through competition (see Threat Section).<br/><br/>Chital subpopulations have been studied in: Corbett (De and Spillit 1966), Kanha (Schaller 1967), Bandipur (Johnsingh 1983, Kumar 2010), Nagarahole (Karanth and Sunquist 1992, Kumar 2010), Sariska (Sankar 1994), Gir (Khan <em>et al</em>. 1995, 1996), Guindy (Raman 1996, Raman <em>et al</em>. 1996), Pench (Biswas and Sankar 2002), Ranthambore (Bagchi <em>et al</em>. 2003) in India, Chitwan (Seidensticker 1976, Mishra 1982) and Karnali-Bardia (Dinerstein 1980; Moe and Wegge 1994, 1997) in Nepal, and Wilpattu (Eisenberg and Lockhart 1972) in Sri Lanka.",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global
22158895,10054,Hippocamelus bisulcus,Endangered,"B2ab(i,ii,iii,iv,v); C2a(i)",2016,2015-10-21 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is confirmed to be Endangered because of an ongoing decline due to natural and anthropogenic factors (e.g. habitat loss, hunting, poaching and predation), reduction in range (area of occupancy) and because remaining populations are small and fragmented. The area of occupancy reflects the fact that the Huemul will not usually occur throughout the area of its extent of occurrence, which contains unsuitable or unoccupied habitats. Population estimates for this species are a minimum of 1,048 and a maximum of 1,500 (López <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1998, Povilitis 1983, Díaz and Smith-Flueck 2000). Densities of 5-8.6 Huemul/km² have been reported in well-studied groups (Díaz and Smith-Flueck 2000, Frid 1999, Grosse 1949, Wensing 2005), and based on body size, Huemul are expected to occur at densities of about five deer/km² (Damuth 1987) in their prime habitat. The population is severely fragmented (Vila <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2006, López <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1998, Díaz and Smith-Flueck 2000, Vila <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2006). There were 101 subpopulations recognized, 60% are found within one grid of max. 64 km² (often 10-20 individuals), 15% of groups are found within two grids of max. 128 km² (often 10-30 animals), and 8% of populations are found within areas of only 192 km² (often 10-30 animals) (Povilitis 1998, 2003).<br/><br/>The species is also listed under criterion C because there are fewer than 2,500 mature individuals and there is a continuing and projected decline in numbers of mature individuals (Vila <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2006, López <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1998, Povilitis 1983, Díaz and Smith-Flueck 2000).","<strong>Habitat:</strong><br/>At present, the Huemul occurs mainly in the Andes mountains, from sea-level up to 3,000 m elevation, and now is found mainly at the forest edge and forests of southern beech (<em>Nothofagus </em>spp.). Locally, Huemul are still found in a variety of habitats: from valley flats to steep mountain slopes, from open grasslands to closed shrubby or forested habitats, inclusive of post-fire or mixed habitats. The pattern of using different habitat components has been found to vary and depends on availability, season, phenology, presences of other herbivores and predators, or disturbances, and is reflected in its broad dietary spectrum (see below). Annual home range size in some currently used habitat has been estimated to be about 350-650 ha with daily travel distances of up to 8 km, but rarely more than 5 km (reviewed in Díaz and Smith-Flueck 2000, Gill <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2008). Serret (2001) postulated that in Argentina the optimum habitat was the transition between the forest and the steppe, but the introduction of sheep and cattle farming and the urbanization in this ecoregion displaced the Huemul populations to the forested areas. Much earlier, Onelli observed in 1897 that most lowland areas he visited already had lost Huemul due to human presence and overhunting (cited in Gigoux 1929), and Magne de la Croix (1937) considered that human pressure was responsible for Huemul only remaining in high mountains at that time. The general displacement of Huemul from traditional winter areas, lowlands or habitats far from forested Andes has been summarized by the Huemul Task Force (2012) and Flueck and Smith-Flueck (2011a, 2012a). In the past, Huemul also occurred in completely treeless areas of the Patagonian grasslands (Díaz 1993, 2000, Frid 1994, Huemul Task Force 2012).<br/><br/><strong>Group size:</strong><br/>Huemul may form small unisex or mixed groups of 2-3 individuals in low-density populations (e.g. 1.79 ± 0.33 ind./km², Corti 2008). The main populations of Huemul are now concentrated primarily on the eastern facing slopes of the Patagonian Andes, and along Chile’s southern coast and associated archipelago. Coastal populations in the Bernardo O’Higgings National Park, Regions of Aysen and Magallanes showed a pattern for group size of seven individuals in the area of Fiordo Tempano, and groups of eight individuals at a density of 8.64 ind./km² in Fiordo Bernardo (Wensing 2005), as well as groups of 8 in Torres del Paine National Park (Guineo <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2008). Groups of 10 Huemul during summer were reported by Grosse (1949). In the Protected Park Shoonem of Alto Rio Senguer (Prov. Chubut, Argentina) it is common to see larger groups in autumn and winter. For instance, there are reports of groups of 11 Huemul (Díaz and Smith-Flueck 2000), and local staff report Huemul groups of up to 17. However, historically Huemul formed large wintering groups and reports of 50 or over 100 exist (e.g. Prichard 1902, reviews in Díaz and Smith-Flueck 2000 and Huemul Task Force 2012).<br/><br/><strong>Density:</strong><br/>In Torres del Paine National Park, Magallanes - Chile, in the Grey area, Pehoé and part of Dickson Lakes there is a Huemul population of at least 60 individuals with a density of 0.7 Huemuls/km² (Guineo and Garay 2014). Within the province of Rio Negro - Argentina, population density in the lower Manso River averaged 1 ind./km² (Smith-Flueck and Flueck 1997), similar to the density reported for Lago Cochrane National Reserve (Corti 2008). The lowest density (0.4 ind./km²) was register in Nevados de Chillán, Biobío, the only population of Huemuls remaining in Central Chile (Povilitis 1978, 1998). In Fiordo Bernardo, Chile, Huemul occurred at a density of 8.64 ind./km² (Wensing 2005). <br/><br/><strong>Predators:</strong><br/>Predators of the Huemul include humans, Pumas (<em>Puma concolor</em>), Culpeo Foxes (<em>Pseudalopex culpaeus</em>) and domestic dogs. Predation can be a major limiting factor of Huemul and even threaten the viability of some remaining subpopulations when reduced to small groups (Wittmer <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014). Huemul are particularly at risk from predation from Pumas (primarily known to kill adult Huemul) and Culpeo Foxes (primarily known to kill fawns) in the form of apparent competition (Corti <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010, Elbroch and Wittmer 2013, Wittmer <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013a). A fawn was observed being killed by a fox, then chased off by the Huemul mother (Wensing 2005, Paulo Corti unpubl.). Saucedo and Gill (2004) reported several fawns being killed by foxes. Hershkovitz (1972) described the several species of foxes, like Culpeo Fox, as dog-like or coyote-like in general appearance and habits. However, two studies of Culpeo Fox diet analysis did not find evidence for Huemul fawn in the diet even during partutition in a syntopic area (Zapata <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2005, Jiménez and Martinez 2010). Puma have been shown to be an important ultimate mortality factor in one subpopulation (Smith-Flueck and Flueck 2001). Huemul will escape persistent pursuers by fleeing, by seeking refuge on cliffs or by using lakes, being very efficient swimmers. When threatened by predators, Huemul may attempt avoidance by first remaining motionless or hiding. However, when discovered at close range they will rapidly flee. Huemul have the capacity to learn and have been observed to increase their flight distance in relation to disturbance activity (M.L. Thomas and O. Guineo pers. comm., Frid 2001).<br/><br/>Close to human settlements and near ranches, Huemul also appear at risk from predation from domestic dogs. For example, Corti <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2010) reported that dogs near the town of Cochrane in Chilean Patagonia were responsible for 16% of observed mortalities of marked Huemul fawns. Hunting and poaching have historically been a major limiting and exterminating factor for Huemul, the extent to which poaching continues to affect Huemul is less clear. <br/><br/><em>Feeding behaviour:</em><br/>Studies so far showed the number of plant species in the diet as low as 11 and as high as 120 in Torres del Paine (Guineo <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2008), which is dependent on the vegetation community, pressure from other herbivores, predators and disturbances. On the other hand, females spent 93 % of their foraging time on only two plant species during the summer-fall season at Fiord Tempano in O’Higgins National Park (van Winden 2006). Gramineae in the summer diet was as low as 0.1% (Smith-Flueck 2003) or as high as 16% (Sierralta 2003). The results of these and other studies shows that the diet of Huemul can vary substantially from one subpopulation to another (also see Smith-Flueck 2003, Galende <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2005).<br/><br/><strong>Seasonal movements: </strong><br/>Huemul have high site fidelity when moving from low elevations in winter to high elevations in summer. A few historical reports refer to the vertical movements of the Huemul (Cabrera and Yepes 1960, Giai 1936, Krieg 1940, Housse 1953, Prichard 1902). In contemporary works, this seasonal movement was suggested in Chillán areas (López <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2004, Povilitis 1978) and confirmed in Torres del Paine (Guineo <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2008), Los Glaciares (Serret and Borghiani 1997) and Los Alerces National Parks (Díaz <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013). Results obtained with collared animals at three study sites in Aysen, Chile, show that those Huemul undertake a modest seasonal migration or none at all. The majority of distances covered between successive locations were less than 1 km and only few over 5 km (Gill <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2003, 2008, Saucedo and Echeñique 2003). Previous reports of movements for unmarked Huemul ranged from 2.0 to 6.7 km for a translocated female in Torres del Paine National Park (Rau 1980) and 2.0 to 4.1 km in the Chillán area (López <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2000, Povilitis 1998). <br/><br/>Although in 1992 several factors were hypothesized to explain the lack of Huemul recovery (cattle, exotic trees, irrational forestry, exotic animals, illegal hunting, diseases, dogs, reduced numbers, loss of winter range), each when taken alone is problematic as a key explanation for the general lack of recovery (Flueck and Smith-Flueck 2006, 2011a).","The widespread reduction in numbers and distributional range across the full extent of the historic range (Redford and Eisenberg 1992) was likely due to a combination from overkill, overstocking with domestic livestock (feral and controlled animals), land conversion for agricultural purposes, and building of towns and roads. This process started before the arrival of Spaniards and peaked before the first systematic accounts were made (Miller 1980), more details remain to be elucidated. Based on the chronology of human settlement, the historical impact would have been earlier in the northern than in the southern portion of the distribution, and earliest possibly in the northwestern portion, which is the central valley of Chile. <br/><br/>The major reduction in numbers and distribution resulted in an increased fragmentation of the population. The resulting subpopulations continue to be affected by a variety of factors, which keep their numbers low or decreasing. It is under these specific local circumstances that myriad biophysical factors can become crucial: human infrastructure, livestock grazing, farming, poaching, predators, new diseases, uncontrolled and/or feral dogs, or unregulated tourism. Huemul subpopulations from such a large variety of habitats and circumstances can be expected to be of different average physical condition, and thus might respond differently to any given factor. <br/><br/>One important omnipresent threat is that Chile and Argentina have weak mechanisms to protect Huemul in non-protected areas, and even inside protected areas. The many problematic activities in areas still containing Huemul are mainly related to livestock production, forest products, mining and tourism of all types including fishing and hunting. <br/><br/>Another omnipresent and continuous threat is lack of suitable winter range. Whereas some subpopulations have access to a sufficient altitudinal range within a small area (due to steepness of terrain), others would need to migrate over much longer distances, particularly on the eastern slopes of the Andes. In all cases, if the winter range is basically occupied by humans a subpopulation may be hindered from recovering. Most historical winter ranges on the eastern slopes are private and are used intensely for livestock production and/or hunting. This includes many protected areas including the national reserves of national parks. Notable exceptions are the Torres del Paine (Chile) and Perito Moreno (Argentina) National Parks: livestock production was removed and Huemul eventually recolonized low-lands, even into steppe areas (Guineo <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2008, Mirabelli 2010). However, in the former, horses and cattle still forage freely in Huemul ranges (Jimenez pers. obs.). Besides loss of winter ranges, migratory behavioral patterns have also been eliminated, as Huemul reaching those winter ranges were regularly killed. <br/><br/>The local circumstances of a given subpopulation would determine the need for specific research to address the problems and to find adequate counter measures (Corti <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2005).<br/><br/><strong>Food competition from other herbivores</strong><br/>Currently, but certainly in the past, Huemul formed part of a natural multi-herbivore system. As in any such system, it is the combined herbivore pressure on forage that is of interest. Huemul and red deer diets in a lenga forest habitat overlapped between 42 to 62%, depending on the season (Smith-Flueck 2003). Some Huemul populations persist, even after having been in the presence of cattle production for over 110 years (Flueck 2010). The broad dietary breadth of Huemul and the variety of environments occupied historically and concurrently corroborate the co-existence of Huemul with native Pudu, Guanaco, and feral cattle during several hundred years (Flueck 2010).<br/><br/><strong>Diseases</strong><br/>In Argentina, veterinary records indicate the presence of dangerous diseases near Huemul populations, as raising livestock is a major economy for the region. In Chile, screening of 18 Huemul for infectious agents did not detect antibodies for bovine herpesvirus-1 nor Brucella abortus, only two Huemul had antibodies for bovine viral diarrhea even though this population had been exposed to sheep and cattle for at least 80 years (Corti <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013). Flueck and Smith-Flueck (2012c) reported on several disease agents: adult females did not reveal ectoparasites (n=73) and testing for antibodies for foot-and-mouth disease viral antigen was negative (n=41). <em>Fasciola hepatica</em> was encountered in three surveys at prevalence from 9% to 50% (n=108). <em>Taenia ovis krabbei</em> was identified, and <em>Cysticerus tenuicollis</em> was found at a prevalence of 8% (n=12). <em>Ostertagia </em>sp., <em>Bunostomum </em>sp. and Dictyocaulus sp. had a prevalence of 75%, 25% and 13% (n=9), respectively. Several gastrointestinal parasites reported at low prevalence in Huemul are common in livestock and are considered commensals in domestic ruminants.<br/><br/>Flueck and Smith-Flueck (2008) reported on bone disease in Huemul from Argentina. Osteopathology was found in 57% of adults, 63% showed mandibular, 100% maxillary and 78% appendicular lesions. These skeletal lesions would affect the capacity for predator avoidance, suggested as an explanation for the population's low average adult age (3.1 years) and lack of recovery. <br/><br/>Recently, Selenium (Se) deficiency was found in the first Huemul population examined so far (Cochrane, Chile), with plasma Se deficient in 73% of individuals (Flueck <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014a). The examination of skeletal remains from the same population revealed bone lesions with a pathophysiognomy similar to Argentine cases, but more severe, and importantly, occurring in a population of Se deficient Huemul (details under 'Seasonal movements' in the section Habitat and Ecology). The role Se deficiency plays in limiting Huemul is ambiguous, because there is no single definition for “healthy population” for either wild or domestic animals (Chihuailaf and Corti 2014) and Huemul has survived since the Pleistocene (Marín <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013) in habitats dominated by volcanic soils lacking in Se (reviewed by Chihuailaf <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014).<br/><br/><strong>Predation</strong><br/>Corti <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2010) reported dogs were responsible for 16% of observed mortalities of marked Huemul, based on tracks, scats, hair, state of the carcass and predator sightings (Corti <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013). Other subpopulations though have declined in the absence of dogs, and the nature of local threats has to be determined for each subpopulation. Where predation is severe, including by native predators, small Huemul subpopulations may not be able to recover without management intervention (Wittmer <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014). Recovering Huemul populations affected by predation might require reducing abundant primary prey and simultaneous predator reductions, at least temporarily (Wittmer <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013b). Culpeo Fox were identified as a major source of Huemul fawn morality during one radiocollar study in Southern Argentina (Corti <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010), but not during a fox diet study in the same region (Zapata <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2005). Also, Jiménez and Martinez (2010) did not find evidence of Huemul preyed or scavenged at Tamango National Reserve when examining 409 Culpeo scats along one year in a high density breeding Huemul area. More study on the source of fawn mortality is warranted. <br/><br/><strong>Genetic problems</strong><br/>Corti <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2011) assessed genetic variability using 14 microsatellite loci in one isolated population in Chile. They sampled 56 individuals between 2005 and 2007 and found low genetic variability, whereas the low inbreeding coefficient suggested nearly random mating which would maximize the maintenance of genetic variation. As there is no apt information on Huemul, the precautionary principle indicates that increasing the size of subpopulations by all means should be a major objective.","The species occurs in fragmented subpopulations with reported densities ranging from 0.02 - 5.66 deer/km² and averaging 1.25 (n=17) (reviewed in Díaz and Smith-Flueck 2000), however, some estimates included unoccupied areas. Wensing (2005) measured 8.64 Huemul/km² in coastal Chile. It has been estimated that no more than 1,000 animals survive in Chile (Drouilly 1983) and 500 in Argentina (Flueck and Smith-Flueck 2006), resulting from reductions of over 99% in population size and of over 50% in distribution (Redford and Eisenberg 1992). In Argentina, the remaining Huemul reside along 1,850 km of Andes in about 50 subpopulations, which are mostly fragmented (Flueck and Smith-Flueck 2006). In 2006, there was an estimated 101 subpopulations of Huemul, but 60 of these only lived within 8x8 km², whereas another 15 lived within 8x16 km². Of these 65 subpopulations, 67% are outside of protected areas (Vila <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2006). In Chile, most Huemul populations are concentrated in coastal Patagonian, where extensive habitat is still present in almost a continuous form. However, fragmentation increases northwards on the mainland. Only a few subpopulations of Huemul in Chile seem to be stable (Tamango and Castillo National Reserves, Torres del Paine National Park, some southern coastal subpopulations). One subpopulation in central Chile has been declining (Povilitis 1998), but trends for most subpopulations are unknown, or only became clear when local extinctions were evident. Although in some localities in Chile and Argentina sightings have increased in recent times, it has not been shown to be due to a numeric response.",Decreasing,"The Huemul is endemic to Chile and Argentina and currently only inhabits the Andes of southern Chile and Argentina (Vila <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2006). The subpopulation in the Nevados de Chillán area (VIII Region of Chile) has the greatest degree of isolation, with a distance of about 400 km from the nearest subpopulation to the south in Nahuel Huapi National Park (Argentina, 40º30'S, SIB-Administración de Parques Nacionales, <a href=""http://www.sib.gov.ar"">www.sib.gov.ar</a>). The southern part of Lanin National Park (Argentina) may still have a subpopulation, but the latest surveys did not detect the specie (Pastore <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013).<br/><br/>However, there were skeletal remains reported in Laguna Fria, Lanin National Park. A male was photographed in Nahuel Huapi National Park and sightings have been reported in this park (SIB-Administración de Parques Nacionales, www.sib.gov.ar). The current distribution has a high degree of fragmentation, with the coastal populations in Chilean Patagonia being the least fragmented, and the most continuous stretch of populations being in areas that are nearly void of human presence (Corti <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2005). The degree of isolation of subpopulations within much of the region, or its effects, remains, however, unclear.<br/>&#160;<br/>The historical distribution range of Huemul covered a latitudinal range of 20 degrees along about 2,000 km. In southern Patagonia Huemul reached the Atlantic, and whereas it occurred in the Patagonian steppe to the north, it is presently uncertain how far east they might have reached (Díaz and Smith-Flueck 2000). Formerly the Huemul occurred along the Andes south of River Cachapoal (34°) to the Strait of Magellan (54ºS) in Chile, and from approximately 36° 50’S to southern Santa Cruz Province, Argentina (Díaz and Smith-Flueck 2000). However, even recently a Huemul was photographed at 36° 41’S near the Argentine border (Vidoz 2012). As a result of pre- and post-Columbian events, there are few historic documents of Huemul existing in extra-Andean landscapes (reviewed in Huemul Task Force 2012), but the suitability of lower elevations for Huemul is evidenced from fossil remains (Perez and Batres 2008) and anecdotal reports (see Díaz 1993, 2000).","Commercialized illegal hunting may no longer occur, or would be limited likely due to increased public awareness. Poaching is mainly by local people, occurs for various reasons: for fish bait along the Pacific coast, for food for ranch dogs and people, and simply to collect a trophy. A risk for accidental or intentional kills occurs in areas with officially permitted commercial hunting of exotic game species. Commercial sport hunting of Red Deer and feral pigs, for instance, is allowed in several areas with Huemul (including some in National Parks). In Huemul areas, these commercial activities should not be allowed; if control hunting is deemed necessary, it should be preferably a task only for the government agencies' staff -if this is not possible, it should be under strict supervision from these agencies. In any case, control should be performed only if a sound and scientifically based plan is in place. The use of dogs should be strictly regulated in all the areas of Huemul distribution. In National Parks in Argentina, a new stricter regulation is in place (Res. HD 59/13), which is being enforced successfully in some Huemul areas but not yet in others. In Chile, a new law that ban dogs from protected areas was just passed. Aside from intentional poaching, dogs accompanying local people may kill Huemul which are then utilized. Hunting with dogs for other species like feral pigs may result in by-catch kills of Huemul. Eco-tourism also exists with organized viewing Huemul in the wild (for instance <a href=""http://doslagoslodge.com"">http://doslagoslodge.com</a>), but no formal management of these activities has been established.",Terrestrial,"As 63% of all subpopulations are outside of protected areas (and another 9% are partially outside), there is an urgent need to establish management plans for most of the remaining Huemul subpopulations. The Huemul is classified as Endangered in the Chilean and Argentinean Red Data Books of Vertebrates (Glade 1988, Díaz and Ojeda 2000) and is also listed in the Appendix I of CITES and UNEP/CMS Conventions. This species has been protected by law since 1929 in Chile and 1989 in parts of Argentina (Díaz and Smith-Flueck 2000). In order to promote Huemul conservation, six binational workshops have been conducted since 1992. In 2001, both countries developed their national Huemul conservation plans (Chile began with an update in 2007), but funding constraints have thus far impeded their implementation. The species occurs in 13 Chilean national parks and reserves (Corti <em>et al.</em> 2005), and details about populations occurring outside of protected areas are either barely known or unknown. In Argentina, Huemul occur in five national parks plus several provincial reserves. Both countries also have some private reserves with Huemul populations. Nevertheless, only 28% of the 101 identified subpopulations in both countries were found within existing protected areas, 63% were located outside of protected areas, while 9% were found partially within protected areas (Vila <em>et al.</em> 2006).The public system of protected areas contains extensive habitat formerly and currently still used by Huemul, making it a prime candidate for contributing significantly to Huemul recovery (Flueck and Smith-Flueck 2006). An urgent task is thus to find ways to extend the implementation and control of existing policies established for protected areas (Martin and Chehebar 2001, Rusch 2002). <br/><br/>Some conservation measures currently prioritized by government agencies of both countries include: increase efforts to obtain more information on Huemul subpopulations such as the current distribution, abundance, and threats; encourage more effective protection of the identified subpopulations (emphasizing an increase of protection in the VIII and XI regions of Chile and in the Province of Chubut of Argentina); promote the creation of private protected areas with presence of Huemul (or suitable habitat) to facilitate connectivity and dispersal; promote training to improve local skills in wildlife management and monitoring techniques; and encourage educational activities and media campaigns to raise awareness about the Huemul´s status (Smith-Flueck <em>et al.</em> 2014). Achieving these measures would be more likely through coordination (also binationally) among the several administrative jurisdictions, private owners, and local communities.<br/><br/>The present state of Huemul with its high degree of spatial fragmentation, small subpopulation sizes, and low total number (Vila <em>et al.</em> 2006) indicates that the situation is not viable, and may be less so in Argentina with only a few hundred remaining Huemul. The trend follows a continued loss of subpopulations, i.e., a reduction in numbers and area of occupancy, even within national parks (Franke 1949, Povilitis 1998, Serret 2001). The goal is the species’ recovery (e.g. Argentina National Huemul Conservation and Recovery Plan, 2001), which implies an increase in numbers and distribution to a viable level. For recovery to succeed, threats to individual remaining Huemul subpopulations need to be understood (Corti <em>et al.</em> 2005). Making decisions about corrective measures should be based on understanding these threats, and would take conservation beyond the creation of protected areas. Basic information on the species and on most subpopulations is very scarce, which complicates interpretations of some observations. A recovery strategy for Huemul must also include <em>ex situ</em> tools, as for many of the questions, the most efficient, and sometimes only, approach would be controlled studies of semi-captive animals (a successful captive center occurs in Chile since 2005, Vidal <em>et al.</em> 2011). It would also provide opportunities to study re-introduced groups (stemming from the captive breeding center), taking an adaptive management approach (Flueck and Smith-Flueck 2006, Armstrong and Seddon 2007). The Huemul captive centre in Chile is planning their first re-introduction of five Huemul for later in 2015. In consequence, several additional conservation measures surfaced that need to be incorporated: 1) Scientific research should be facilitated by all agencies involved and for any existing Huemul subpopulation; 2) Centres with semi-captive Huemul for studies and re-introductions function as a valuable recovery tool and should be facilitated, particularly when non-competing funds are available. Efforts should be directed to gain a maximum of information through research under controlled conditions and through reintroductions; 3) Once subpopulations are known to be recovering numerically and spatially, they should become a research focus in order to determine the reasons for the recovery; and 4) The groups assigned to coordinate a centralized and country-wide conservation effort based on Huemul National Plans (“Comisión Nacional” in Chile, “Comité de Gestión” in Argentina) need to adopt a policy of transparency.",Neotropical,,false,false,Global
22160030,15803,Ozotoceros bezoarticus,Near Threatened,,2016,2015-10-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The species is listed as Near Threatened as it almost qualifies for listing in a threatened category under criterion A2c. This is based on an inferred population decline as a result of habitat loss, which may have approached 20-25% over the last ten years. Habitat conversion to agriculture and cattle farming, and hunting and persecution by feral dogs are constant threats, and the species is confined to a human dominated landscape with only patches of remaining habitat. The former Pampas Deer range has been dramatically reduced from 95 to 99% of the original habitat in the last century. Today less than 1% of the habitat remains (González<em> </em>1993, 1996). Although the Pampas Deer is adaptable to some degree of habitat modification, it should be monitored to ensure rates of decline do not increase. Habitat fragmentation is a serious threat to the existing population (González 2004, González <em>et al.</em> 2010).","The species occupies a range of open habitats in the Neotropics, in particular grassland areas and the cerrado shrublands. In Argentina, it also occurs in coastal salt marshes.","Habitat conversion for agriculture and competition with domestic livestock have been reported as threats to the Pampas Deer (Wemmer 1998). Due to the fragmentation of the remaining habitat the small and isolated populations face other threats. Other threats include over-exploitation for food, hides, and sport, predation by feral dogs, and possibly bovine disease (Wemmer 1998). In Brazil in Paraná State, another cause of mortality, outside of the Conservation Units, is the juvenile and fawn mortality during the crop harvest (Braga 2004). Predation of fawns by feral pigs occurs in both San Luis and the Bahia Samborombon; and fawns are kept as pets by local people (J. Jackson pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Breeding of cattle and sheep is also signaled as one of the negative factors for the species, due to competition for food and habitat, or transmission of diseases (Jackson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1980, Cosse <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009, Giménez Dixon 1987). However, there are situations where agricultural activity is compatible with the conservation of the Pampas Deer (Merino <em><em>et al.</em></em>&#160;2011). The presence of dogs related with the cattle activities and, even more, of feral dogs that attack the deer is a serious threat (Jackson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1980, Beade <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2000).","There is not update information of total population size there are partial estimation for population specifically in the Southern part of South America<em>.</em> The populations from Argentina and Uruguay show a declining trend (González <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2002, González <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010). A minimum estimate for the total population size is 20,000 (Pinder 1994), while the maximum population size is estimated at 80,000 (Pinder 1994) individuals.<br/><br/>The largest extant populations are found in Brazil, in the northeast cerrado ecosystem where about 2,000 individuals live, and in the Pantanal where 20,000 to 40,000 exist (Pinder 1994). While in the last years two subpopulations were discovered, one further north on the island of Marajo, at the mouth of the Amazon River (Rossetti and de Toledo 2006), extending the species range, and the other in the south of the country a small subpopulation in Paraná State estimated to be less than 100 individuals (Braga <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005). <br/><br/>In Uruguay there are two main subpopulations: El Tapado (Salto Department) with 800 individuals, and Los Ajos (Rocha Department) with approximately 300 deer (Weber and González 2003). At the turn of the 20th century, the Argentinean population was likely very large since over 500,000 km² of grassland habitat was available. However, today only three small subpopulations remain: Corrientes (Ituzaingo Department) with about 170 individuals (Merino and Beccaceci 1999), in San Luís Province) with approximately 800-1000 individuals (Merino <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011) and coastal Bahía de Samborombóm (Buenos Aires Province) with about 200 individuals (Merino <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1997) and in Santa Fé “Bajos Submeridionales” area there is a small subpopulation estimated to be less than 50 individuals which lives in an area of 23,000 ha. (Vera Department, Pautasso 2011). A small subpopulation may still be extant in the southeastern part of Bolivia (Weber and González 2003). Small subpopulations of Pampas Deer may still be extant in the National Park Noel Kempff Mercado (Santa Cruz Department), in southwestern Bolivia (Anderson 1985, 1993; Tarifa 1993). However, it is restricted to relatively small patches of suitable habitat and may have become locally extinct in some of them.",Decreasing,"The Pampas Deer occurs in insular populations in western, northern, and  central Argentina, eastern Bolivia, central and southern Brazil,  Paraguay, and Uruguay. Prior to the 1800s, the species was abundant  throughout the grasslands of South America (Wemmer 1998, González <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em>  2010). The Pampas Deer was a widespread species occupying a range of  open habitats, including grasslands, pampas and the Brazilian savanna  known as the Cerrado, in eastern South America from 5º to 41ºS (Cabrera  1943, Jackson 1987, Merino <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1997, González <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1998, 2002, González 2004, Weber and González 2003, González <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em>&#160;2010). However, the area encompassed by these habitats has been  dramatically reduced to less than 1% of that present in 1900 (González <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1998). Currently, Pampas Deer populations are generally small and highly isolated (Jackson and Langguth 1987; González <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1998, 2002).","For information on use and trade, see under Threats.",Terrestrial,"Included on CITES Appendix I. <br/><br/>In Argentina the entire Samborombón Bay area has been a protected area since the 1970s. The area currently includes two provincial reserves (Bahia de Samborombón and Rincón de Ajó) and one national park “Campos del Tuyú”; all of which were created with the purpose of providing refuge and protection to Pampas Deer. The entire Bay was included in the List of Wetlands of International Importance of the Ramsar Convention and was declared as Wildlife Refuge in 1997.<br/><br/>A Pampas Deer PHVA workshop was conducted in Uruguay in 1993 and conservation recommendations were listed for the main populations in Uruguay (González&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1994). Several conservation deer workshops were facilitated by Deer Specialist Group to plan management and conservation strategies for this species. These have been followed up by diverse research and conservation activities in the region.<br/><br/>Recommended conservation actions include further population surveys, ecological research, strengthening of existing management of protected areas, creation of new protected areas, establishment of a collaborative captive breeding programme, and enlisting the co-operation of local landowners in maintaining this species (Wemmer 1998). In 1984 the Province of Buenos Aires declared the species a ""Natural Monument"" in Argentina (Gimenez Dixon 1991). The provinces of Corrientes, and San Luis did likewise in the 1990s. Uruguay also declared it Natural Monument in 1985 (decree 12/9/85).<br/><br/>In spite of all these efforts, the majority of populations remain in fragile condition. Recommended conservation actions include further population surveys, ecological research, strengthening of existing management of protected areas, creation of new protected areas, establishment of a collaborative captive breeding programme, and enlisting the co-operation of local landowners in maintaining this species (Wemmer 1998). Some measures must be implemented to develop privately owned protected areas in order to preserve these last populations. These measures must include exoneration of taxes by government agencies and other fiscal incentives to stimulate private conservation action (González <em>et al.</em> 2002.).",Neotropical,,false,false,Global
22164089,18848,Pudu puda,Near Threatened,,2016,2016-01-25 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Southern Pudu is a small sized deer endemic to the South American Temperate forests (Jiménez 2010). This deer was previously listed as Vulnerable under criterion A2cd+3cd (Jiménez and Ramilo 2008). The population of this species is inferred to have declined as native forest (its primary habitat) has declined almost 50% in the last 500 years (Lara <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2012). In the last 12-15 years (3 generations) the species has probably declined up to 20% due to the combination of forest loss, predation by domestic dogs and other threats, and is expected to continue declining. In this scenario, the Southern Pudu would be close to meeting criterion A2cde+3cde. The extent of occurrence of the species is much larger than 20,000 km² (see Pavéz-Fox and Estay 2016), and although population size is unknown, it is suspected to be larger than 10,000 individuals. Therefore, since the Southern Pudu does not meet the criteria for Vulnerable but is close to meeting criterion A, it is listed as Near Threatened.","The Southern Pudu occurs between the sea level and 1,700 m (Miller <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1973, Jiménez 2010). Pudus can use both mature and disturbed forests (Eldridge <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1987, Jiménez 2010), and are associated to dense understory (Eldridge <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1987, Meier and Merino 2007, Silva-Rodríguez and Sieving 2012). In the Valdivian Coastal Range, Pudu uses primary and secondary evergreen forest, eucalyptus plantations (Silva-Rodríguez and Sieving 2012) and alerce (<em>Fitzroya cupressoides</em>) forests (Silva-Rodríguez pers. obs.) whereas in other areas it is associated to dense Chusquea sp. bamboos (Jiménez pers. obs.). In Argentina, Meier and Merino (2007) reported the presence of Pudu in <em>Nothofagus dombeyi</em> forests and was associated to dense understory. Eldridge <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (1987) reported home-ranges between 10.2 and 26.1 ha. Pudus are considered solitary deer, although home-range overlapping occurs (Eldridge <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1987, Jiménez 2010).","The species has likely experienced important declines over historical time. Nearly half of the native forests in the Valdivian Ecoregion in Chile (35º-43º30’) were lost between 1550 and 2007 (Lara <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012). This area comprise most of Pudu distribution. Forest loss has been more severe in the northern part of Pudu distribution. For example, in coastal areas of the Maule region 67% of forest was lost between 1975 and 2000 (Echeverría <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2006). In La Araucanía, deforestation rates have reached 2.9% for the period 1999-2008, rates that are higher than in previous periods (Miranda <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015). Deforestation rates are lower (but still important) from Los Rios to the south. Lara <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2012) reported that 66% and 74% of the forest present in 1550 was extant in Los Rios and Los Lagos, respectively in 2007. For coastal forests of Los Ríos region, net forest loss between 1985 and 2011 was 5.1% (Zamorano-Elgueta <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015). According to Echeverría <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2012), in three areas of Los Lagos region forest loss occurred at annual rates of 1% (northern Chiloé, 1985-2007), 1% (Maullín, 1985-2007) and 0.8% (Rupanco, 1986-2006). Forest lost is often replaced by exotic tree plantations (e.g., Echeverría <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2006, Miranda <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015, Zamorano-Elgueta <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015). Pudus can use plantations if there is dense understory (e.g., Silva-Rodríguez and Sieving 2012, Simonetti <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013). However, considering that the final destiny is exploitation, plantations should be—at best—considered poor quality habitat.<br/><br/>Attacks by domestic dogs are a common threat. Dogs are associated to human houses (Silva-Rodríguez and Sieving 2012, Sepúlveda <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015) and roads (Sepúlveda <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015, Moreira-Arce <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015). Dog attacks on Pudu occurs in multiple areas (Silva-Rodríguez <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010, Silva-Rodríguez and Sieving 2011, 2012, Sepúlveda <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014), even within national parks (Chang Reissig <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013), and is a frequent reason for Pudu admission to rescue centers (Silva-Rodríguez <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010). In the Valdivian Coastal Range, Silva-Rodríguez and Sieving (2012) reported that the probability of Pudu presence was higher in areas with lower probability of dog presence. Similar scenarios may occur in other areas such as Chiloé (J. Jiménez, pers. obs.). The importance of dogs as a threat is expected to be critical in fragmented landscapes, where the area free of dog influence may be small (Silva-Rodríguez and Sieving 2012).<br/><br/>Invasive deer and wild boar (<em>Sus scrofa</em>) are present in part of Pudu distribution (Meier and Merino 2007), whereas cattle is widespread (e.g., Meier and Merino 2007, Silva-Rodríguez <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010). Within Pudu distribution, non-native herbivores lead to habitat degradation, affecting understory (e.g., Veblen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1989, 1992; Raffele <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007), and forest regeneration (Zamorano-Elgueta <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). The potential ability of these invasive species to occupy and modify diverse habitats (Barrios and Ballari 2012) might affect the distribution of Pudu (Meier and Merino 2007). The presence of cattle-related pathogens has been documented in Pudu (e.g., pestivirus, Pizarro-Lucero <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005;<em> Mycobacterium avium</em> subsp. <em>paratuberculosis</em>, (Salgado <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015)), although the significance of these findings for Pudu populations in the wild is unclear. Wild boar could eventually prey on Pudu fawns, but to our knowledge this has not been documented.<br/><br/>Roads are an additional threat that deserves attention. Animals are in occassion hit by cars (Silva-Rodríguez <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010) even inside protected areas (Pastore and Ramilo pers. obs., Jiménez pers. obs.) and highways could be a barrier to movement, although this has not been tested. However, roads and road development is a concern because of the indirect effects associated. Roads facilitate the movement of dogs (Sepúlveda <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015), one of the key threats for Pudus and land-cover change often occurs associated to roads (Wilson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005). In Chile, the projected bridge between Chiloé and mainland deserves attention, as it may connect Chiloé and mainland populations (that present genetic and morphological differences, see Fuentes-Hurtado <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011) and may facilitate the invasion by carnivores that are native in mainland, but absent from Chiloé, such as foxes and pumas. Thus, road development cannot be seen simply as animals killed by cars, but as an important driver of other threats.","Up to recently, total population was thought to be less than 10,000 animals (e.g., Wemmer 1998, Jiménez and Ramilo 2008, Jiménez 2010), however there are no field data-based estimations (Jiménez 2010). Pudus are abundant in Chiloé (Jiménez 2010), and are frequently detected in camera traps in the Coastal Range of Los Ríos and Los Lagos regions (Silva-Rodríguez and Sieving 2012, Silva-Rodríguez pers. obs., A. Farías pers. com.) as well as in the coastal forests of the Nahuelbuta range (Jiménez pers. obs.). In the Central Valley of the Araucania region Pudus are very rare, nearly absent, whereas in the Andes of the same region it is considered rare but its presence is associated with riparian vegetation of major rivers and native forest within small valleys that surround protected areas (N. Gálvez pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Simonetti and Mella (1997) estimated that the area needed to sustain a population of 500 Pudus (assuming 100% suitable habitat) would range between 79 and 128 km². Following the same reasoning and assuming that 10% of the native forest was occupied by Pudu, the area needed to sustain 10,000 Pudus would range betwen 15,800 and 25,600 km² of native forest. Remaining forests between Maule and Los Lagos in Chile (35º-43º30’S) cover an area of approximately 57,626 km² (Lara <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012), therefore the Pudu population is likely to exceed the 10,000 figure in this area (that represents a portion of its distribution). Although there is no data on population trends, population is suspected to be declining as a result of forest loss and degradation, predation by domestic dogs, as well as potential impacts from other alien species and poaching (Jiménez and Ramilo 2008, Jiménez 2010; see Threats).",Decreasing,"The Southern Pudu occurs in southern Chile and southwestern Argentina from 35º10’ to 46º45’S (Jiménez 2010). In Chile, recent records within this range include Trehualemu at the coastal range of the Maule region (Simonetti <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013), Valdivian Coastal Range (Silva-Rodríguez <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010, Silva-Rodríguez and Sieving 2012), Nahuelbuta Mountain Range, Puyehue, Perez-Rosales and Chiloé National Park (Jiménez pers. obs.) and Huinay, Palena (Delibes-Mateos <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014). In southern Chile, Pudus are also commonly recorded in Puma <em>(Puma concolor) </em>scats (Rau and Jiménez 2002). In Argentina, 54 localities have been recorded (Pastore 2004, Meier and Merino 2007) between Lago Quillén, Lanín NP (39º23’ S, 71º17’ W) and Arroyo Pirámide, Los Alerces NP (42º58’S, 72º00’W). The extent of occurrence of this species is much larger than 20,000 km² (see Pavez-Fox and Estay 2016).","Pudu poaching still occurs in some areas (Jiménez 2010, Silva-Rodríguez <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010). However, attitudes towards Pudu seem to be positive at least in the Valdivian Coastal Range (Stowhas 2012), Chiloé (Jiménez pers. comm.) and the Maulino forests (Zorondo-Rodríguez <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014). This suggest that poaching could be less common than before, at least in these areas. In the Valdivian Coastal Range, Pudus are often saved by people from dog attacks (Silva-Rodríguez and Sieving 2012). In Argentina, poaching has not been documented in recent years (Ramilo 2001, Meier and Merino 2007). However, in other areas poaching for subsistence purposes occurs (Silva-Rodríguez <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010, Jiménez 2010), and in some cases poaching is the final result of a dog attack (Silva-Rodríguez <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011).<br/><br/>Poaching for (illegal) commercial purposes as well as to supply private collections is likely to occur. During the 1980’s over 600 Pudus were captured in Chiloe island (Astorga 1987 as cited in Jiménez 1995) and between 1985-1993 42 animals were legally exported from Chile (Iriarte <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1997). The current magnitude of poaching for commercial purposes is unknown, but it is suspected that the captive population is supplemented with wild animals (Jiménez 2010).",Terrestrial,"<u>Conservation actions in place</u><br/>This species is listed on CITES Appendix I. Hunting is illegal in all the territory of Argentina (Law 22.421) and Chile (D.S. Nº 5/1998 MINAGRI). The Southern Pudu is listed as vulnerable in Chile (D.S. 151/2007 MINSEGPRES). Also, it is considered as a “Special Value Species” in Argentinean national parks where the species is present (Res. 284/91).<br/><br/>There is a large number of protected areas within Pudu distribution, and Pudu is known to be present in many of them (Jiménez 2010). In Argentina, 98% of localities recorded are located within national parks (Pastore 2004). A high proportion of the protected areas within the distribution of Pudu in Chile are larger than the minimum needed to sustain 500 individuals (Simonetti and Mella 1997). In addition, in Chile there are several private protected areas within Pudu distribution (Maule to Aysen, e.g., Valdivian Coastal Reserve, Tantauco, Pumalin, etc.), that as a whole, protect several hundreds thousands of hectares (see Praus <em>et al.</em> 2011).<br/><br/>Pudu is a conservation target for the Valdivian Coastal Reserve (Delgado 2005, Silva-Rodríguez <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015). In this area, monitoring is in place, and different strategies such as promoting better care of dogs, forest restoration and cattle management are in different stages of implementation (Silva-Rodríguez, pers. obs.).<br/><br/>Finally, there is an important stock of Pudus in captivity. There is an international studbook for the species that, between 1966 and 2013, had registered 1159 individuals, including 122 animals that were alive (May 2013) in 40 different institutions (Stadler and Aurich 2013). In February 2016 there were 136 Pudus registered in the Zoological Information Management System (ZIMS) (International Species Information System&#160; 2016). In addition, captive Pudus in Chile were estimated in 295 (Jiménez 2010). The captive stock has allowed to conduct a large number of studies on the biology (especially reproductive biology) of the species (e.g., Reyes <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1988, Bubenik <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2000,&#160; Stadler and Aurich 2015, see review in Jiménez 2010).<br/><u><br/>Important conservation actions needed</u><br/>As stated above there is a large number of protected areas within the distribution of the Pudu. However, there are some key issues that may affect the effectiveness of these areas in Chile. First, there is an important gap between the funds needed to manage adequately the protected areas and the funds available (Ladrón de Guevara <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). Consequently, adequate funding for protected areas is a fundamental issue to address. Second, private protected areas are important, but currently lack a normative framework (Praus <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011), and consequently, securing the long term conservation of private protected areas is an important challenge.<br/><br/>Efforts to address the dog problem are being implemented in both Argentina’s (Pastore pers. obs.) and Chile’s Protected Areas System (CONAF 2015), through regulations that limits the entrance of dogs into officially protected areas. However, there is still an impact by dogs from the surrounding areas (Silva-Rodríguez and Sieving 2012), therefore limiting the ranging behavior of local dogs is fundamental but at the same time challenging due to the important roles that dogs play for rural households (e.g., Silva-Rodríguez and Sieving 2012, Sepúlveda <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015). These measures, need to be supported by better nation-wide policies on dog-ownership and responsibility.<br/><br/>Rehabilitated, rescued and confiscated Pudus are often released, but this management has been innefective in the coastal range as released individuals are quickly killed by pumas (A. Aleuy pers. comm.). Additionally, the release is a concern (Silva-Rodríguez <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011, 2015), because released animals may represent a risk for the receptor population if protocols are inadequate. Animals should not be translocated between mainland and Chiloé because they present important genetic and morphological differences (Fuentes-Hurtado <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011). Following international standards (e.g., IUCN 2000) for the release (or not) of the rehabilitated animals is fundamental and animals that can not be released could be allocated to environmental education (Silva-Rodríguez <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011).<br/><br/><u>Research needed</u><br/>Pudu conservation has been limited by the fact that up to recently most information available was anecdotal (Jiménez 2010). In recent years, this has began to change (e.g., Meier and Merino 2007, Fuentes-Hurtado <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011, Silva-Rodríguez <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010, Silva-Rodríguez and Sieving 2012). However, and despite major advances, still there are no estimates of Pudu population size or density. This major gap requires urgent attention.<br/><br/>There has been recent advances in the understanding of some of the threats that affect Pudu, including exotic plantations (Silva-Rodríguez and Sieving 2012, Simonetti <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013) and domestic dogs (e.g., Silva-Rodríguez <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010; Silva-Rodríguez and Sieving 2011, 2012; Sepúlveda <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). However, there are still very important gaps in understanding. First, recent evidence suggest that the presence of native understory is a key factor explaining the use of exotic plantation by forest mammals, including Pudu (Simonetti <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013), however it is unclear how the long-term management of plantations (including clearcuts), affect or will affect Pudu. Second, Pumas, the main native Pudu predator, commonly prey on invasive species such as the European hare (<em>Lepus europaeus</em>) (Rau and Jiménez 2002). This alternate prey may keep high puma population that in turn may prey on Pudus (Silva-Rodríguez and Sieving 2011, Jiménez per. obs.). Third, the potential impact of wild boar on Southern Pudu habitat need to be clarified as this invasive species might affect the distribution of Pudu (Meier and Merino 2007). Forth, the potential effect of cattle-related pathogens on Pudu, such as pestivirus (Pizarro-Lucero <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005) and <em>Mycobacterium avium </em>subsp. <em>paratuberculosis </em>(Salgado <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015), is unknown and should be elucidated by further research. Fifth, it is important to determine whether poaching for commercial or subsistence purposes is a threat for some of the populations of this species. Finally, there are multiple threats, so assessing their relative importance (and the contexts in which they become important) is fundamental (Silva-Rodríguez <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011).<br/><br/>Fuentes-Hurtado <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2011) suggested that Chiloé and mainland Pudu populations were different Evolutionary Significant Units. The authors proposed nomenclature for potential subspecies, however D’Elia (2012) indicated that minimum criteria to establish the new nomenclature was not met. Whether populations from Chiloé should be named as a different subspecies or not, is still waiting for an answer.",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

There are threats within its range, primarily due to agricultural expansion, as well as other threats.&#160; The species is experiencing local extinctions in some parts of its range and is sensitive to habitat changes - it cannot tolerate desert habitat. Further survey work to refine its distribution and establish the rate of declines across its range should be prioritised.</p>","The species occurs in steppe and semi-desert habitats. There are some records from cultivated plains (Misonne 1957). Like all <em>Allactaga</em> species, this species is not found in loose sands. Primarily, jerboas are nocturnal rodents spending most of the daylight hours in underground burrows emerging at night to forage. Most species have a vegetarian diet. Females may give birth to up to nine young. March to July is the breeding season in Turkey, February to May in Iraq (Harrison and Bates 1991). There may be more than three litters per year (Çolak and Yigit 1998).","The major threat to the species is agricultural expansion in Jordan and Syria. In Jordan, the species declined by approximately 50%&#160;from 1985 to 2005&#160;owing to agricultural expansion; its population there continues to decline (Z. Amr pers. comm. 2005). The species' range is threatened by irrigation for cotton in Turkey. It is considered edible by several tribes of Bedouin in Jordan (Qumsiyeh 1996). Also, the species is hunted in some areas of Turkey. In Syria, there is massive capture (using spotlights at night) of the species which is sold to falconers for food (Serra pers. comm.).","When found together with <em>Jaculus jaculus</em>, <em>A. euphratica</em> is always less common (Qumsiyeh 1996).

The populations in Iraq are unknown, as there have been no recent studies, while it has recently been recorded from Ilan province in western Iran (Darvish <em>et al. </em>2012). In Jordan surveys have shown a decline in the species, in 2005 the species was very infrequently encountered in areas where it was previously considered common; the situation in Syria is similar with surveys from 2000-2003 showing a marked decrease in the population (Z.

The species may also meet the threshold for Critically Endangered under D, as there may be less than 50 mature individuals in the wild.</p>","The primary habitat is arid and semi-arid bushland and grassland. In Eritrea and Ethiopia, the African Wild Ass lives in volcanic landscape of the Great Rift Valley where they range from below sea level in the Dalool Depression to 2,000 m (Moehlman <em>et al.</em> 2013). In Eritrea and Ethiopia, limited observations indicate that African Wild Asses are primarily grazers, but that they will also utilize browse. Typical of arid habitat equids, the only stable groups are composed of a female and her offspring. Females do associate with other females or with males, but even temporary groups are small. Low density and low sociability may be due to low forage quality and availability. In the Mille-Serdo Wild Ass Reserve the preferred forage is <em>Aristida</em> sp., <em>Chrysopogon plumulosus</em>, <em>Dactyloctenium schindicum</em>, <em>Digitaria</em> sp., <em>Lasiurus scindicus</em>, and <em>Sporobolus iocladus</em> (Kebede 1999, Moehlman 2002, Moehlman <em>et al</em>. 2013).  In Eritrea, <em>Pannicum turgidium</em> is an important forage species (Teclai 2006).","<p>The major threat to the African Wild Ass is hunting for food and medicinal purposes; for example, body parts and soup made from bones are used for treating tuberculosis, constipation, rheumatism, backache, and bone ache (Kebede 1999, Moehlman 2002, Moehlman <em>et al. </em>2013). Limited access to drinking water and forage (largely due to competition with livestock) is also a major constraint, with reproductive females and foals less than three-months old most at risk. Hence, it will continue to be important to determine critical water supplies and basic forage requirements, allowing management authorities to determine (in consultation with local pastoralists) how to conserve the African Wild Ass (Kebede 1999, 2007; Moehlman 2002; Teclai 2006; Moehlman <em>et al.</em> 2013). The third possible threat to the survival of the African Wild Ass is potential interbreeding with the domestic donkey (Moehlman 2002, Moehlman <em>et al. </em>2013). However, there is no scientific evidence that indicates hybridization of <em>Equus africanus somaliensis </em>with domestic donkeys (Kebede 2013). &#160;</p>","In Ethiopia, there has been a severe population decline since the early 1970s. Klingel (1977) recorded group sizes of 10-30 individuals in the Danakil, and he estimated a density of 18.6 wild asses per 100 km<sup>2</sup> in an area of approximately 10,000 km<sup>2</sup>. During that survey, Yangudi-Rassa National Park (NP) had the highest density (30 wild asses per 100 km<sup>2</sup>). In 1994, Moehlman and Kebede did a ground survey of the Yangudi-Rassa NP, but no wild asses were seen, although local Issa pastoralists reported that they were present but rare and occurred at an approximate density well below one animal per 100 km2 (Moehlman 1994, Kebede 1995, Moehlman <em>et al</em>. 1998). Surveys conducted from 1994-1998 in an area of 2,000 km2 indicated that there were approximately 0.5 wild ass per 100 km<sup>2</sup> (Moehlman 2002). In 2007, Kebede surveyed the historic range of the African Wild Ass in Ethiopia (Kebede <em>et al</em>. 2007) and determined that they have been extirpated from the Yangudi-Rassa NP and the Somali Region and that the only remaining population is in the northeastern Afar Region. The total number of wild ass observed during this survey was 25 in an area of 4,000 km<sup>2</sup> yielding a density of 0.625 animals per 100 km<sup>2</sup>. In 2009 and 2010, Kebede (2013) did quarterly ground surveys in the African Wild Ass range and sampled 17% of the total African Wild Ass range in Ethiopia (12,300 km<sup>2</sup>). The density estimate was computed applying D=N/A where D=density, N total number of individuals recorded, A= sample area (km<sup>2</sup>). Then the result obtained was extrapolated to the suitable habitat determined using the Maxent model to estimate the population (Kebede <em>et al</em>. 2014). The 2009-2010 survey results indicated that the species’ distribution is restricted to few localities in the Danakil. The current population estimate indicated that this species occurs in low density, approximately one African Wild Ass per 100 km<sup>2</sup>. Current population estimates indicate that the population size has declined significantly (~94%) since the 1970’s and 112±4 individuals of African Wild Asses are estimated to survive in the Danakil desert (Kebede 2013).<br/><br/>In Eritrea, there are limited long-term data. The first successful survey was made in 1996 (Moehlman <em>et al</em>. 1998) and there has been a research and conservation programme with the Ministry of Agriculture and Hamelmalo Agricultural College. The main study site in the Northern Red Sea Zone has had a population of roughly 47 individuals per 100 km<sup>2</sup> (Moehlman <em>et al</em>. 1998, Moehlman 2002). This is the highest population density found anywhere in the present range of the species and is similar to population densities recorded in Ethiopia in the early 1970s (Klingel 1977). This is a limited study area (100 km<sup>2</sup>), but recent research indicates that African Wild Ass currently inhabit approximately 11,000 km<sup>2</sup> in the Denkelia desert (Teclai 2006). Surveys and Maxent analyses of suitable habitat are needed to determine the distribution and density of African Wild Ass in this larger area. A rough estimate of African Wild Ass in Eritrea would yield a total of possibly 400 individuals.<br/><br/>In 1978-1980, Watson (1982) did aerial surveys in northern Somalia and estimated that there was a population of 4,000-6,000 African wild ass in the area from the Nugaal Valley to the Djibouti border. Given the area covered by the survey, this would indicate approximately six African wild ass per 100 sq km.&#160; In 1979/82 Simonetta and Simonetta (1983) estimated that there were about 250 African Wild Ass in the northwestern Nugaal Valley and that there were about 50 African Wild Ass near Meit, with scattered groups along the coast in the Erigavo region. In 1989 (Moehlman 1998) a ground survey with limited aerial reconnaissance in the Nugaal Valley yielded population estimates of roughly 135 to 205 wild asses or approximately 2.7 to 4.1 asses per 100 km2. This indicates that there perhaps has been a significant reduction in the African wild ass population during the decade between those surveys. In 1997, Moehlman returned to the Nugaal Valley but was not able to survey the entire area. Local pastoralists said that there was less than ten African wild ass left in the Nugaal Valley (Moehlman et al. 2013). Some animals may remain near Meit and Erigavo, but this area has not been surveyed since the 1970s (Moehlman <em>et al</em>. 2013). It is not known if African Wild Ass currently persists in Somalia.<br/><br/>In summary, the total number of observed African Wild Ass in Eritrea and Ethiopia is roughly 70 individuals; there may be as many as 600 individuals in these two countries, but this figure is a very rough extrapolation from more intensely studied areas. The number of mature individuals is approximately one-third of the population (Feh <em>et al</em>. 2001), hence the minimum number of mature individuals is 23 and the maximum might be 200. In Ethiopia, in the last 35 years there has been a greater that 95% population decline and in the last 12 years the African Wild Ass has been extirpated from roughly 50% of its range (Kebede <em>et al</em>. 2007). In Eritrea, the population is stable and slowly increasing. However, it is difficult to predict population trends into the future. The desert habitat of the African Wild Ass in both Eritrea and Ethiopia suffers from recurrent and extreme droughts (Kebede 1999).",Decreasing,"The African Wild Ass occurs in Eritrea and Ethiopia, and some animals may persist in Djibouti, Somalia, Sudan and Egypt, but there is no recent information available (Moehlman <em>et al</em>. 2013). Yalden <em>et al</em>. (1996) recorded them to 1,500 m in Ethiopia.<br/><br/>Two subspecies are recognized. The Nubian Wild Ass, <em>E. a. africanus</em>, lived in the Nubian desert of north-eastern Sudan, from east of the Nile River to the shores of the Red Sea, and south to the Atbara River and into northern Eritrea (Watson 1982). During aerial flights in the 1970s, wild asses were seen in the Barka Valley of Eritrea and in the border area between Eritrea and the Sudan (Watson 1982). The Somali Wild Ass, <em>E. a. somaliensis</em>, was found in the Denkelia region of Eritrea, the Danakil Desert and the Awash River Valley in the Afar region of north-eastern Ethiopia, western Djibouti, and into the Ogaden region of eastern Ethiopia. In Somalia, they ranged from Meit and Erigavo in the north to the Nugaal Valley, and as far south as the Shebele River (Moehlman 2002, Moehlman <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>The current range of the African Wild Ass in Ethiopia and Eritrea is approximately 23,000 km<sup>2</sup> (Kebede 2013, Teclai 2006). DNA extracted from faecal samples collected from animals in Eritrea and Ethiopia resulted in the identification of five mitochondrial DNA haplotypes: one haplotype (group of polymorphisms) is specific to the Eritrean population (haplotype D); one haplotype specific to the Ethiopian population (haplotype E); and three shared haplotypes (A, B, and C). These results suggest that there is and/or has been gene flow between the subpopulations (Afrera, Serdo) in Ethiopia and the population in Eritrea (Oakenfull <em>et al</em>. 2002).",The African Wild Ass is hunted for food and medicinal products. It is only hunted at the subsistence level.,Terrestrial,"In Ethiopia, the Yangudi-Rassa National Park (4,731 km<sup>2)</sup> and the Mille-Serdo Wild Ass Reserve (8,766 km<sup>2</sup>) were established in 1969. However, the former has never been formally gazetted, and both areas are utilized by large numbers of pastoralists and their livestock. These areas are remote and extremely arid, and the Ethiopian Wildlife Conservation Authority (EWCA) has not had sufficient funds or personnel for appropriate management (Kebede 1999). In Eritrea, the government designated the African wild ass area between the Buri Peninsula and the Dalool Depression as a high-priority area for conservation protection as a nature reserve. In both Eritrea and Ethiopia, research and conservation programs (Ministry of Agriculture and EWCA) have been critical for sustaining African Wild Ass populations by involving local pastoralists in their conservation. There are no protected areas in the range of the species in Somalia.<br/><br/>The African Wild Ass is listed as CITES Appendix I in both Ethiopia and Eritrea. Populations of Somali Wild Ass are maintained in captivity (Moehlman 2002, Kebede 2013). <br/><br/>Recommended research and conservation actions, include:<br/><ul><li>Ecosystems based and population dynamics research on the African Wild Ass in Eritrea and Ethiopia</li><li>Research on interactions among pastoralists, livestock, wildlife and the environment</li><li>Awareness campaign with local communities in Ethiopia on medicine/veterinary care</li><li>Continued employment and training of local pastoralists as scouts</li><li>Continued education and awareness campaigns on the ecological and cultural roles of wildlife</li><li>Continued workshops and active involvement of local pastoralists in the preparation of management plans</li><li>Post-graduate training of personnel in Eritrea and Ethiopia</li><li>Surveys in Eritrea, Djibouti, Sudan and Egypt to determine current distribution of African Wild Ass</li><li>Genetic research on the African Wild Ass and local domestic donkey populations to clarify the genetic status of the two subspecies.</li></ul><p></p>",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

The species is confirmed Least Concern.","Mexican Cottontails have quite broad ecological preferences, being found  in tropical, semi-arid, and temperate forest, open forest, dense shrub,  and grassland. From southern Sinaloa to western Michoacán, they occur  along the coastal plain at sea level to the mountain slopes (Chapman and  Ceballos 1990). In central Mexico they occur in pine and pine-oak  forest, particularly with clumped understory grasses, xeric scrub  dominated by Kidneywood Tree (<em>Eysenhardtia polystachya</em>), Shadbush  (<em>Amelanchier </em>spp.) and Sumac (<em>Rhus </em>spp.), grasslands of Mexican  Broomroot (<em>Muhlenbergia</em> <em>macroura</em>) and Peruvian Feather Grass (<em>Stipa  ichu</em>), Alligator Juniper forests (<em>Juniperus deppeana</em>), and oak forests  (<em>Quercus </em>spp.) (Lorenzo <em>et al.</em> 2018). In western Mexico they  occur in pastures, dry deciduous forest, and areas of disturbed  vegetation (Chapman and Ceballos 1990), they can also be found in upland  valleys of tropical deciduous and mixed pine-oak (Lorenzo <em>et al.</em> 2018). <br/><br/>Home  range size is around 3.3 ha and 4.06 ha for both females and males,  respectively, with overlap in ranges between the sexes (Vázquez <em>et al.</em> 2013, Rodríguez-Martínez <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>Although  they are able to reproduce throughout the year, peak reproduction  occurs during the warmer and wetter summer from March through October  (Vázquez <em>et al.</em> 2006, Vázquez <em>et al.</em> 2007). Up to six young are produced per litter and gestation time is 28-34 days (Cervantes <em>et al.</em> 2005, Aguilar <em>et al.</em> 2014, Lorenzo <em>et al.</em> 2018). Total length for this species ranges from 48.5-51.5 cm (Cervantes <em>et al.</em> 2005).<br/><br/>The  Mexican Cottontail is sympatric with other Lagomorphs in portions of  its range, including the Volcano Rabbit (<em>Romerolagus diazi</em>), Desert  Cottontail (<em>Sylvilagus audubonii</em>), the Eastern Cottontail (<em>S.  floridanus</em>), White-sided Jackrabbit (<em>Lepus callotis</em>), the Black-tailed  Jackrabbit (<em>L. californicus</em>), and the Antelope Jackrabbit (<em>L. alleni</em>)  (Cervantes <em>et al.</em> 2005).

They are also primary consumers and seed  dispersers, especially for Alligator Juniper (Lezama-Delgado <em>et al.</em> 2016).<br/><br/>Although  they engage in group feeding and running in pairs, this species can  also be strongly aggressive and can be contained in a maximum group size  of 3-4 females and 2 males within a 530 m2 habitat (Lorenzo <em>et al.</em> 2018).","The Mexican Cottontail is threatened in some areas by overgrazing,  hunting, habitat fragmentation, and habitat destruction, which has  caused the decline of some populations (Chapman and Ceballos 1990). It  is also vulnerable to human-induced fires and volcanic activity. Habitat  reduction has been estimated to be between 13-23% over the last three  generations (Cuarón and de Grammont pers. comm.). A climate change model  generated for 2050, indicated that there will be 22% range reduction  (primarily along the Pacific coast, impacting <em>S. c. pacificus</em>) from the  current potential range of this species (Martinez-Villeda 2006).","The Mexican Cottontail was previously considered to be abundant (Chapman  and Ceballos 1990), but has experienced recent declines in portions of  its range (Lorenzo <em>et al.</em> 2018). It has been reported that the  average density was 27 ± 5.4 individuals/km² in central Mexico at La  Malinche National Park, Tlaxcala, which varies according to the rainy  and dry seasons (Gonzalez <em>et al.</em> 2007). Recent declines have been  associated with areas where overgrazing, hunting, and habitat  degradation occur (Gilcrease 2014).",Decreasing,"The Mexican Cottontail is endemic to Mexico and has the widest  distribution of all endemic cottontails in Mexico.

45223529,2055,Arctocephalus australis,Least Concern,,2016,2016-01-28 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The total number of South American Fur Seals is estimated at about 238,000 and population size of the South American subspecies is likely increasing. The species does not meet any IUCN criteria for a threatened listing and should be listed as Least Concern. However, the Peruvian subspecies is much less abundant (about 21,000 total) and the IUCN Pinniped Specialist Group has listed it as Vulnerable.","South American Fur Seals are sexually dimorphic. Adult males are approximately 1.3 times longer and 3.3 times heavier than adult females. Adult males can reach 2 m and 90–160 kg, and possibly 200 kg; females do not exceed 1.5 m long and weigh on average 60 kg. Males of the Peruvian subspecies are smaller than the South American subspecies and females are slightly larger (Oliveira <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005, 2008a). Newborns are 50-65 cm and 3-7.5 kg (Vaz-Ferreira 1982, Punta San Juan Program unpublished data), with initial mass being significantly greater for male pups (Baladán Corbo 2012). Females reach their maximum reproductive value at 3-5 years old (Lima and Páez 1995, 1997). Their reproductive cycle has a duration of 11 months, with a 3-4 month embryonic diapause (Vaz Ferreira <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1982, Katz <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013).<br/><br/>Breeding takes place from late October through mid January (Majluf 1987a, Franco-Trecu 2005). Pupping peaks in mid November to mid December, and mating occurs 1-6 days after the female gives birth (Franco-Trecu 2005, Pavés and Schlatter 2008). Following birth, the mother suckles her pup and fasts on shore for almost 11 days (Franco-Trecu 2010). Then the female begins to make foraging trips punctuated by time attending the pup ashore, spending up to 4-5 days foraging at sea and 1-2 days feeding offspring at rookeries (Bastida and Rodriguez 2003). During the first three months of maternal care, duration of foraging trips by females is highly variable, which affects the survival of offspring since longer trips increase pup mortality (Franco-Trecu <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010b).<br/><br/>Time spent on feeding trips and attending offspring likely varies with location, changes in marine productivity, and age of offspring, or a combination of these factors. Trip distances, trip durations and lengths of visits increase throughout the season. During the early lactation females perform short nocturnal foraging trips. Trip duration starts increasing during mid-lactation, but the majority of foraging effort still concentrates close to breeding sites. Later in the season, when pups are capable of withstanding longer fasts and metabolic demands of pregnancy and lactation are higher, females may stay at sea longer and forage in more distant prey patches (Thompson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003). In the Atlantic, the effects of El Niño-La Niña are less strong. Within the usual variability, the differences between years are relatively minor and the effects of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are relatively moderate. In the absence of drastic changes in the ecosystem, attendance patterns are not affected (Franco-Trecu 2010).<br/><br/>Colonies are generally found along rocky coasts, on ledges above the shoreline or in boulder strewn areas. Most areas utilized have some source of shade such as at the base of cliffs or under boulders, and easy access to the ocean or tidal pools (Stevens and Boness 2003). Around midday, Fur Seals make daily movements from high and dry levels of the rookeries to cool off in low and wet areas or in the sea (Cassini 2001, Vaz-Ferreira and Ponce de León 1984). During the reproductive season, these movements can often cause female aggression towards conspecifics, mostly at other females, in order to protect their new-born pups and maximize their offspring’s survival (Cassini 2001).<br/><br/>Males are polygynous and territorial, and fighting can result in serious wounds and scars (Cappozzo 1995). The number of breeding females associated with a territorial male varies between 3-6 in southern Chile (Pavés and Schlatter 2008) and 6-20 at Punta San Juan (Majluf 1987a). The highest number of territorial males at the colonies can be found in late December, decreasing in January (Franco-Trecu 2005, Franco-Trecu <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). Individual bulls can occupy territories for up to 60 days (Cappozzo 1995) until most of the females are mated, and then they leave their territories to start foraging at sea (Pavés and Schlatter 2008). Only a few adult males out of the total population achieve mating, and a large proportion is excluded to peripheral or male exclusive areas. In Uruguay, the breeding pattern is a ""lek"" system where females have extensive home ranges that overlap with the small territories of many males. Females move freely in the colony and males do not monopolize access to females (Franco-Trecu <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>Most pup mortality take place at the beginning of the breeding season, during the peak of birthing (Franco-Trecu 2010). In general, the principal causes of death of South American Fur Seal pups are enteritis with microscopic lesions of bacteremia (associated with the presence of hookworms) (28%), and starvation, trauma, and drowning (63%) (Seguel <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013). Locally, pup mortality is also caused by predation by adult male South American Sea Lions that can be significant at some colonies (Harcourt 1993). Maternal aggression was also recognized as an important source of mortality for Peruvian Fur Seals before the 1997-98 ENSO (Harcourt 1991,1992; Majluf 1992).<br/><br/>Based on satellite tracking data, South American Fur Seals apparently forage between 50 and 600 m with no clear water-depth preference, and mean duration of the female foraging trips during the breeding season is 126 hours (Thompson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003). Lactating females in Uruguay forage 41-185 km from the breeding sites (Vaz-Ferreira 1976, York <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1998). For the Peruvian Fur Seal, ENSO years have a negative impact on animals and during those years females must spend much more time attempting to forage, which affects offspring growth and survival (Majluf 1987a, Gentry and Kooyman 1987). During the 1983 ENSO, adult female Peruvian Fur Seals showed mean dives to 29 m, with a maximum of 170 m and mean duration of 2.5 minutes and maximum of 7 minutes (Majluf 1987b). During the 1997 ENSO, adult females had to spend longer periods at sea foraging (10-20 days) causing their pups to die of starvation.<br/><br/>The location of foraging grounds almost certainly depends on the distribution of preferred prey (Laptikhovsky 2009). The foraging area of the South American Fur Seals southwest of the Falkland Islands coincides with the region of the highest abundance of the Lobster Krill (<em>Munida </em>spp.), the most important food resource of Fur Seals off the Falklands (Laptikhovsky 2009). Seasonal variations in intensity and position of both the Falkland Current and Argentine Drift could also be a reason for seasonal changes in female foraging grounds (Thompson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003).<br/><br/>The Southern Fur Seal diet varies according to prey availability. Although they are trophic generalists with the potential to prey upon many species, a few species dominate their diet. Pelagic and demersal fishes and cephalopods are the most common prey (Vásquez 1995; Zavalaga <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1998, Arias-Schreiber 2000, 2003; Oliveira <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008b, Vallejos 2010, Franco-Trecu <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012, 2013, 2014).","Development of large and small scale commercial fisheries have a negligible effect on South American Fur Seals in the Atlantic due to the minimal overlap between Fur Seal prey items and target commercial species (Crespo pers. comm.). In contrast, industrial fishing along the coast of Peru may threaten the pelagic resources on which Fur Seals depend. Those fisheries started in the 1950s and 1960s, and contributed to several declines in biomass of Anchoveta which is a major prey of Fur Seals (Pauly and Palomares 1989, Pauly and Tsukayama 1987).<br/><br/>Mortality due to bycatch and interactions is known to occur occasionally in artisanal and other fisheries (Maijluf <em>et al.</em> 2002, Franco-Trecu <em>et al.</em> 2009, De Maria 2012, Sepúlveda pers. comm., Cárdenas-Alayza unpublished data). Incidental captures of Fur Seals in shark nets have been reported in Uruguay (Scialabba 1989, Franco-Trecu <em>et al.</em> 2009). <br/><br/>During the 1970s and part of the 1980s, South American Fur Seals (and other wildlife) were hunted illegally in southern Chile and Argentina to bait traps set for Southern King Crab. Bait used between 1976 and 1980 was estimated as 200–400 tons per year (Cárdenas <em>et al.</em> 1987). Because this fishery is decreasing due to overexploitation, hunting pressure on the Fur Seal is being reduced. In Peru, Arias-Schreiber (1993) reported that it is common for some fishermen to kill and use pinnipeds as bait to catch saltwater Snails. However, the incidence of illegal Fur Seal catches and their impact on populations are not known. <br/><br/>The limited number of large, dense breeding aggregations could make this species particularly sensitive to the effects of oil spills and disease epidemics. Like other Fur Seals, South American Fur Seals are vulnerable to oil spills because of their dependence on their thick pelage for thermoregulation. In February 1997, 5,000 metric tons of crude oil were spilled from the vessel San Jorge onto on the coast of Isla de Lobos in southern Uruguay. Nearly 5,000 South American Fur Seal pups (2-3 months old) were heavily oiled and/or died (Mearns <em>et al.</em> 1999).<br/><br/>With the breeding population located at a limited number of rookeries, human activities could have populations consequences if disturbance occurs (Cárdenas-Alayza 2012).","Available data on South American Fur Seal abundance were compiled and reviewed in the 2016 IUCN Red List assessments for the two recognized subspecies. Estimates of the number of mature individuals, and population trend, for each of those subspecies were as follows:<br/><ul><li>South American Fur Seal--99,000, trend increasing weakly; </li></ul><ul><li>Peruvian Fur Seal--10,500, trend unknown.&#160; <br/></li></ul>The figures indicate the total number of mature Southern Fur Seals is approximately 109,500, and 219,000 is a reasonable estimate of the total population size. Since the much more abundant South American subspecies is known to be increasing it is likely the species as a whole is increasing also.",Increasing,"The South American subspecies is distributed along the western South Atlantic (southern Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, and the Falkland Islands), and eastern South Pacific (southern Chile) coasts. On the Atlantic side, haulouts can be found along the coasts of Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil (approximately from 29º to 32º S) (Muelbert and Oliveira 2006, Oliveira 2013), although the northern limit for breeding colonies is at Islas del Castillo, Uruguay (34º21’S, 53º44’W). Throughout the coast of Argentina, breeding and non-breeding colonies continue to be found until Tierra del Fuego-Isla de los Estados at the extreme south, also including the Falkland Islands (Túnez <em>et al</em>. 2008, Crespo <em>et al</em>. 2015). Their distribution continues all around the southern tip of South America to the Pacific side, to Isla Guafo in southern Chile (43º33’S, 74º51’W) (Oliveira 2004). <br/><br/>The Peruvian subspecies is distributed along the coast of Peru and northern Chile. In Peru they occur from Isla Mazorca (11° 20’S) to Ilo (17°42’S), with a small isolated colony occurring in northern Peru at Isla Foca (5°&#160;20’S) (Oliveira <em>et al</em>. 2012). At the southern limit of Peru, colonies continue on the north coast of Chile (from 17°- 2° S) (Torres 1985, Guerra and Torres 1987), although the distribution of this species in Chile is now expanding to the South, reaching to 29°S (Sepúlveda, pers. comm.). Thus, the majority of the breeding population occurs in Peru from 15° to 17°S.","Human subsistence hunting of South American Fur Seals undoubtedly began with first contact and continues today. Commercial exploitation began after the discovery of South American Fur Seals by Europeans in the 18th century. As an example, in 1775 the ship States from Boston, loaded 13,500 skins from the Falkland Islands area (Bonner 1982). A managed harvest was conducted in Uruguay, and between 1965 and 1991 (when harvesting ceased) 234,000 Fur Seals were harvested. Harvest levels generally declined in the 20th century bringing about the cessation of hunting at many locations (Ximenez and Languth 2002). In Peru, commercial harvests are believed to have reduced Fur Seal numbers to the point that it was thought that few, if any, Fur Seals were left by the late 20th Century (Majluf and Trillmich 1981, Muck and Fuentes 1987). That led to the banning of all sealing in 1959, and population numbers increased following protection.",Terrestrial|Marine,"South American Fur Seals are protected and managed by laws in most of the countries where they occur. In Peru it is illegal to poach, export, or transport Fur Seals for commercial purposes (Decreto Supremo No. 013-99-AG). The catastrophic decline that followed the 1997-1998 ENSO led to South American Fur Seals being categorized as in danger of extinction in Peru (Decreto Supremo No. 034-2004-AG), and this decree was recently revised and Fur Seals remain in the same category (Decreto Supremo No. 004-2014-MINAGRI). In Chile, the status of total protection was given to all <em>Arctocephalus </em>species in 1978 (Torres 1987, Reijnders <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1993), and in 1995 the protection was extended for 30 years (Decreto Supremo No. 225-Subsecretaría de Pesca; Sielfeld 1999). In Argentina, marine mammals are under the administration of the provinces. At the Falkland Islands, Fur Seals are protected by British law. In Brazil, all the pinniped species have been protected by law since 1986 (Portaria SUDEPE n0 N-11, de 21-02-1986) and also by the National Action Plans for Conservation of Brazilian Aquatic Mammals (IBAMA 2001, Rocha-Campos <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011). In Uruguay, the South American Fur Seal was named as a focal object of conservation in the Marine Protected Area of Cabo Polonio by the National System of Protected Areas. South American Fur Seals have also been afforded protection by the establishment of numerous reserves and marine protected areas, including privately owned sites.",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

The sum of the few population estimates that exist is around 320,000 individuals, however, surveys have covered only a fraction of the total distribution of the species, and therefore total abundance is likely to be substantially higher. This species is widely distributed, generally far from land. There have been no reported population declines and no major threats have been identified. Therefore, Fraser’s Dolphin is assessed for the IUCN Red List as Least Concern. The species is, however, data-poor throughout much of its range so the assessment must be considered provisional pending better information.","<p>Fraser’s Dolphin is an oceanic species that prefers deep offshore waters, but it can be seen near shore in some areas where deep water approaches the coast (such as the Philippines, the Lesser Antilles, Mayotte and the Comoros islands, La Réunion, Taiwan, and the Indo-Malay Archipelago) (Perrin <em>et al</em>. 1994, Dulau-Drouot <em>et al. </em>2008, Kiszka <em>et al. </em>2010). Sightings in coastal waters over the continental shelf are rare.<br/><br/>In the eastern tropical Pacific Fraser’s Dolphins occur most often in equatorial-southern subtropical surface water and other waters typified by upwelling and generally variable oceanic conditions (Au and Perryman 1985). Along the east coast of South Africa, records are associated with the warm Agulhas Current that flows southward in the summer (Perrin <em>et al</em>. 1994).<br/><br/>Fraser's Dolphins are relatively high trophic-level oceanic predators and feed mostly on mesopelagic fishes (myctophids), cephalopods, and crustaceans (Dolar 2018, Kiszka <em>et al. </em>2011, Dolar <em>et al</em>. 2003, Wang <em>et al. </em>2012). Physiological and dietary studies indicate that Fraser’s Dolphins are capable of quite deep diving and that they do most of their feeding deep in the water column, in waters up to 600 m deep. However, they have been observed to feed near the ocean surface (Watkins <em>et al</em>. 1994). They are frequently observed in association with other species, particularly Pantropical Spotted Dolphins (<em>Stenella attenuata</em>) and Melon-headed Whales (<em>Peponocephala electra</em>). </p>","<p>Small numbers of Fraser's Dolphins have been taken regularly or opportunistically by harpoon in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, the Philippines, Taiwan and probably elsewhere in the Indo-Pacific (Leatherwood and Reeves 1989, Jefferson and Leatherwood 1994, Kahn 2004, Dolar <em>et al.</em> 1994, Perrin <em>et al.</em> 2005). A few have been taken in drive fisheries in Taiwan and Japan (Perrin <em>et al</em>. 1994). Dolar <em>et al</em>. (1994) investigated directed fisheries for marine mammals in the central and southern Visayas, northern Mindanao, and Palawan, Philippines. Some of the hunters take dolphins for bait or human consumption and the species taken include Fraser's Dolphins. Dolar <em>et al. </em>(1994) reported that around 800 cetaceans, including Fraser’s Dolphins, were taken annually by hunters at the seven sites, mostly during the inter-monsoonal period of February-May.<br/><br/>A small number of Fraser’s Dolphins were killed incidentally in the tuna purse-seine fishery in the eastern tropical Pacific: 26 were documented to have been taken during the period 1971–75 (Gerrodette and Wade 1991). Some are also taken in gillnet fisheries in the tropics (e.g., in Sri Lanka, Philippines, Taiwan). Some have been killed in anti-shark nets in South Africa (Perrin <em>et al</em>. 1994, Cockcroft 1990). Incidental catches are also known to occur in purse seines (Philippines) and trap nets (Japan) (Jefferson and Leatherwood 1994). In the French West Indies (Guadeloupe, Martinique), Fraser’s Dolphins are relatively common and regularly exposed to increasing cetacean-centered tourism, which could affect their behavioral budgets.</p>","<p>Fraser’s Dolphins are widespread, but are among the less abundant cetaceans in tropical oceans, except in a few areas such as the Lesser Antilles and the Philippines where sighting rates are relatively high (Gero and Whitehead 2006, Dolar <em>et al</em>. 2006). Few abundance estimates are available. Based on annual surveys conducted from 1986 to 1990, there were estimated to be about 289,300 (coefficient of variation (CV)=34%) Fraser’s Dolphins in the eastern tropical Pacific (Wade and Gerrodette 1993, Perrin <em>et al</em>. 1994). Pooled data from 1996 to 2001 yielded an estimate of about 726 (CV=70%) in the northern Gulf of Mexico (Waring <em>et al</em>. 2006). A shipboard line-transect survey of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) around the Hawaiian Islands resulted in an abundance estimate of 16,992 (CV =0.66) in 2010 (Bradford <em>et al</em>. 2013). Fraser’s Dolphins were among the most commonly encountered cetaceans in the Sulu Sea of the Philippines in 1994-95, with an estimated total abundance of 13,518 (CV=27%) (Dolar <em>et al</em>. 2006). They were encountered infrequently in areas surveyed in the northern and western Indian Ocean (Ballance and Pitman 1998, Braulik <em>et al</em>. 2018, Dulau-Drouot <em>et al. </em>2008, Kiszka <em>et al. </em>2011, Kumarran 2012, Minton <em>et al.</em> 2010). The sum of the above abundance estimates is approximately 320,000 individuals; however, the reported surveys covered only a small fraction of the total range of the species and therefore total abundance is likely to be considerably higher.</p>",Unknown,"<p>Fraser's Dolphin has a pantropical distribution, mainly between 30°N and 30°S in all three major oceans (Jefferson and Leatherwood 1994, Dolar 2018). Strandings in temperate areas (Victoria in Australia, Brittany in France, Argentina, and Uruguay) are believed to represent extra-limital forays connected with temporary oceanic anomalies. For example, a mass stranding occurred along the Atlantic coast of France in Brittany (Perrin <em>et al</em>. 1994) during the world-wide El Niño phenomenon in 1983–84. Bones <em>et al</em>. (1998) reported on a stranding on the coast of Scotland which is also considered to be outside of the usual range. Fraser’s Dolphins have been recorded in the wider Caribbean and in the Gulf of Mexico (Jefferson and Shiro 1997, Boisseau <em>et al. </em>2006, Yoshida <em>et al. </em>2010). There are very few records from the west coast of Africa, probably at least partly due to a paucity of survey effort (Torda <em>et al. </em>2010, Weir <em>et al. </em>2008). In the southwestern Atlantic Fraser’s Dolphins have been recorded from the coast of Brazil as far south as 35°S, in temperate waters (Moreno <em>et al. </em>2003). In the Indian Ocean, they have been recorded from many countries, including the Comoros, Mayotte, Tanzania, Seychelles, and the Mascarenes (Ballance and Pitman 1998, Braulik <em>et al.</em> 2018, Dulau-Drouot <em>et al. </em>2008, Kiszka <em>et al. </em>2010, 2011). They are also present, but are relatively uncommon, in the tropical Pacific (Miyazaki and Wada 1978, Gannier 2000, Barlow 2006). They can be relatively common around some oceanic islands and archipelagos, particularly in the Lesser Antilles (Boisseau <em>et al. </em>2006, Gero and Whitehead 2006, J. Kiszka, unpub. data) and southeast Asia (Dolar <em>et al.</em> 2006). Recent sightings have been recorded around the Azores (Gomes-Pereira <em>et al. </em>2013).

Combining the most current abundance estimates for the known and surveyed subpopulations results in a total global abundance of more than 170,000 whales, however this does not include Northeast Greenland or the Russian Arctic for which no estimates are available. Ten subpopulations number more than 10,000 individuals, and two subpopulations number more than 35,000. One subpopulation is thought to be increasing, five are considered stable, and for five the trend is unknown. As a species, the Narwhal does not meet any IUCN criteria for threatened categories and is listed as Least Concern </p>  <p></p><p>Across the global range of the Narwhal, subpopulations are of various sizes and subject to differing levels of threats. Due to this variability, some of the subpopulations warrant Red List assessment.</p>","<p></p><p>  </p><p>Narwhals spend approximately two months each summer in ice-free bays and fjords of the Canadian Arctic, eastern Baffin Island, western and eastern Greenland, and Svalbard (Innes <em>et al</em>. 2002, Richard <em>et al</em>. 2010, Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2010). In some parts of this range during summer they may aggregate at tidewater glacier fronts (Lydersen <em>et al</em>. 2014, Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2016). In autumn, Narwhals migrate with the forming fast ice to wintering areas that tend to be deep, offshore, ice-covered habitats along the continental slope (Innes <em>et al</em>. 2002, Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2003, Laidre and Heide-Jørgensen 2011, Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2015). Narwhals are highly adapted to winter habitats with limited open water (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2004, Laidre and Heide-Jørgensen 2011). Few other cetaceans use areas with such dense sea ice cover, and Narwhals have remarkable site fidelity to these areas. They may dive to depths of over 1,500 m multiple times per day and spend over 3 h per day at depths of 800 m (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2003,<em></em> 2010). A double-platform visual aerial survey over a Narwhal wintering ground in West Greenland found high densities of whales in the leads and cracks of the Baffin Bay pack ice, up to an average density of about 77 Narwhals/km² (Laidre and Heide-Jørgensen 2011).</p>  <p></p><p>In the winter, Narwhals feed intensively at the sea floor (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2003, <em></em>2004; Laidre and Heide-Jørgensen 2005a) but some subpopulations may also feed on pelagic prey (Watt and Ferguson 2014). A major portion of the annual energy intake is obtained during the winter. Although there seems to be relatively little feeding activity during the summer, Narwhals apparently feed opportunistically during this time. Narwhal sighting probability in winter in habitats with &lt;50% open water is significantly higher than sighting probability in habitats with &gt;50% open water, suggesting that the animals select for optimal foraging areas in dense pack ice regardless of the availability of open water (Laidre and Heide-Jørgensen 2011). In the autumn and winter Narwhals are vulnerable to ice entrapments, or sassats, when rapidly changing conditions cause open-water areas used by the whales to freeze over and trap them, sometimes leading to suffocation (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2012). Calving occurs in spring during the northbound (or in some populations inshore) migration that coincides with the receding sea ice. There is remarkable consistency across Narwhal subpopulations in the types of habitat used, in site fidelity to migration routes and summering and wintering areas, and in feeding patterns (Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2015). Fish, squid, and shrimp make up the Narwhal’s diet (Hay and Mansfield 1989, Heide-Jørgensen 2009), especially Arctic fish species, such as Greenland Halibut (<em>R</em><em>einhardtius hippoglossoides</em>), Arctic Cod (<em>Boreogadus saida</em>), and Polar Cod (<em>Arctogadus glacialis</em>) (Laidre and Heide-Jørgensen 2005a).</p>  <p></p>","<p>The Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna (CAFF) Arctic Biodiversity Assessment (CAFF 2013) lists threats to arctic marine mammals as harvest, loss of sea ice, human activities, pollution, and disease (see also Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2015). Narwhals are susceptible to all those threats, but their importance among the many Narwhal subpopulations varies. </p>  <p>Narwhals were never the targets of large-scale commercial hunting except for a brief period of several decades of the early 20th century in the eastern Canadian Arctic (Mitchell and Reeves 1981). They were hunted opportunistically by commercial whalers, explorers and adventurers in many parts of their range. At present, Narwhals are hunted only in some indigenous communities in Canada and Greenland – for both human consumption and for ivory (see Use and Trade). In some communities Narwhal carcasses are at least partially used as dog food. The strong fidelity of Narwhals, which causes them to return to the same nearshore areas each summer, makes them highly vulnerable to overexploitation. In nearly all parts of their range, hunting is now controlled by limits on harvest levels that are judged to be sustainable (NAMMCO in prep.) (also see the <em>Conservation Actions</em> section) </p>  <p></p><p>Ongoing climate change is resulting in substantial loss of sea ice in the Arctic (Comiso 2012, Stroeve <em>et al</em>. 2012), including changes in the timing of sea ice formation and breakup (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2015, Frey <em>et al</em>. 2015). The effects of climate change on Narwhals are uncertain. Broad changes in the ecosystem may influence the distribution of their prey. Narwhals are well adapted to a life in the pack ice as indicated by the fact that there is very little open water in their winter habitat (Laidre and Heide-Jørgensen 2005b), and they can be found in high densities in areas with more than 98% ice coverage (Laidre and Heide-Jørgensen 2011). They spend much of their time in heavy ice and in some areas are vulnerable to ice entrapments where hundreds can become trapped in a small opening in the sea ice and die (Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2002). This occurs when sudden changes in weather conditions (such as shifts in wind or rapid drops in temperature) freeze shut leads and cracks that the Narwhals were using, and such entrapment may be occurring more often as autumn freeze-up occurs later in the year and on an unpredictable schedule (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2012). When entrapped whales are discovered by hunters, they normally are harvested. Killer Whales (<em>Orcinus orca</em>) are known to prey on Narwhal in summering areas (Ferguson <em>et al</em>. 2012) and the presence Killer Whales in such areas can greatly affect Narwhal behavior (Breed <em>et al</em>. 2017). Sea ice normally inhibits movements of Killer Whales, and Higdon and Ferguson (2009) documented substantial increases in Killer Whale presence in Hudson Bay when sea ice reduction allowed them to pass through Hudson Strait. An assessment of the sensitivity of all arctic marine mammals to climate change ranked the Narwhal as one of the three most sensitive species, primarily due to its narrow geographic distribution, specialized feeding and habitat choice, and high site fidelity (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2008).</p>  <p>Known or potential threats to Narwhals include a variety of commercial human activities in addition to hunting, and climate change is facilitating increases in the scale and distribution of those activities. Oil and gas development is ongoing and expanding, and along with commercial shipping is likely to modify and degrade habitat used by Narwhals (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2014). Areas in Greenland and arctic Russia are subject to oil and gas exploration and development, which often includes seismic surveys, offshore drilling, and artificial island construction, accompanied by ice breaking and shipping. Finley <em>et al</em>. (1990) found that Narwhals at an ice edge reacted strongly to ice-breaking ships, and Cosens and Duek (1993) concluded that Narwhals would likely be able to detect the high-frequency components of icebreaker noise 25-30 km from the source. Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al.</em> (2013) speculated that noise from seismic surveys, at least in some contexts, could enhance the susceptibility of Narwhals to ice-entrapment.</p>  <p>Pollution from industrial and other sources is pervasive in the world’s oceans and marine mammals are known to accumulate levels of contaminants that are high enough to cause impacts on health and reproductive performance (Ross 2000). Organochlorine and heavy metal contaminants have been found in Narwhals in several areas (Dietz <em>et al</em>. 2004). At Svalbard, Wolkers <em>et al</em>. (2006) found that levels of contaminants in Narwhals were higher than those in Beluga Whales (<em>Delphinapterus leucas</em>). </p>  <p></p><p>Commercial fisheries for Greenland Halibut operate in both the Canada and Greenland sides of Baffin Bay/Davis Strait and have done so on the inshore Greenland side for several decades (Treble and Bowering 2002). This fishing overlaps spatially with where Narwhals winter and feed extensively on the target species, Greenland Halibut (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2004, Laidre and Heide-Jørgensen 2005a). </p>  Like other marine mammals, Narwhals are exposed to a number of diseases that may influence their population status (Gulland and Hall 2006), but significant epizootics have not been recorded. Nielsen <em>et al</em>. (2001) found a low prevalence of exposure to <em>Brucella</em> spp. in Narwhals sampled in arctic Canada. Nielsen <em>et al</em>. (2000) found no serological evidence of exposure to morbilliviruses, and speculated that because they are immunologically naïve, Narwhals are at considerable risk of a serious epidemic if they become exposed. Burek <em>et al</em>. (2008) described ways in which climate change could influence disease exposure for arctic marine mammals.","<p></p><p></p><p></p><p>The global Narwhal population consists of about 12 subpopulations with varying degrees of genetic differentiation and geographical isolation (hereafter the terms subpopulation and stock are used interchangeably). Due to incomplete sampling in parts of the range, particularly in Russia, the total number of subpopulations is not precisely known.<em> </em>In 1999, the International Whaling Commission’s (IWC) Scientific Committee recognized two stocks of Narwhal but noted that there were probably more that were not yet recognized (IWC 2000). A recent (March 2017) Global Review of Monodontids (GROM) hosted by the North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission (NAMMCO) developed a list of 12 Narwhal stocks (NAMMCO in prep.). <br/></p>  <p>Discrimination and definition of subpopulations are based mostly on nearshore areas (principally fjords and bays) where Narwhals congregate during summer. Genetic studies, satellite telemetry, traditional ecological knowledge, stable isotope values, and contaminant analyses have shown that Narwhals have strong matrilineally driven fidelity to those areas (e.g., Palsbøll <em>et al.</em> 1997, Riget <em>et al</em>. 2002, de March <em>et al</em>. 2003, Westdal <em>et al</em>. 2010, Watt <em>et al</em>. 2013). <br/></p>  <p>Available information on sizes of Narwhal subpopulations is summarized below. <br/></p>  <p><strong>Northern Hudson Bay</strong></p>  <p></p><p>Narwhals from the Northern Hudson Bay subpopulation summer in northwestern Hudson Bay, particularly in Repulse Bay and in waters around Southampton Island. They winter in eastern Hudson Strait (Richard 1991, Westdal <em>et al</em>. 2010). The abundance of Northern Hudson Bay Narwhals in 2011, corrected for perception bias (animals that were at the surface but not seen by observers) and availability bias (animals too deep to be seen by observers), was estimated as 12,485 (CV 0.21; Asselin <em>et al</em>. 2012). Richard (1991) reported results of surveys conducted in 1982, 1983, and 1984 that were limited to areas with less than 20% ice cover and his estimates were not corrected for availability. Abundance estimates from Richard (1991) ranged from 1,038 to 1,517 but were certainly biased negatively. A similar survey in 2000 estimated uncorrected abundance as 1,780 (Bourassa 2003). Abundance of this subpopulation is believed to be fairly stable (NAMMCO in prep.).</p>  <p><strong>Somerset Island</strong></p>  <p>Narwhal from the Somerset Island subpopulation range over a large area in the eastern Canadian Arctic. During summer, satellite-tagged animals were mostly concentrated around Somerset Island and they spent winter in Baffin Bay (Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2003). The abundance of Somerset Island Narwhals in 2013, corrected for both perception and availability biases, was estimated as 49,768 (CV 0.20; Doniol-Valcroze <em>et al</em>. 2015). Previous abundance surveys were flown in 1982, 1996, and 2002. The corrected estimate for 1982 was 27,656 (CV 0.54; Richard <em>et al</em>. 2010). Analysis of those data by Witting (2016) suggests that abundance has been increasing. <br/></p>  <p><strong>Admiralty Inlet</strong></p>  <p>Narwhals from the Admiralty Inlet subpopulation remain in and near the Inlet during summer, and spend winter in the Baffin Bay region (Dietz <em>et al</em>. 2008, Watt <em>et al</em>. 2012). The most recent abundance estimate for Admiralty Inlet Narwhals comes from aerial line-transect surveys flown in 2013 (Doniol-Valcroze <em>et al</em>. 2015). When corrected for perception and availability biases the abundance estimate for this stock was 35,043 (CV 0.42). Four previous surveys in 1975, 1985, 2003, and 2010 yielded lower mean abundance estimates with wide confidence intervals. Analysis of those data by Witting (2016) suggested that abundance has been stable. <br/></p>  <p><strong>Eclipse Sound</strong></p>  <p>Narwhal from the Eclipse Sound subpopulation generally stay in and near the Sound in the summer, and winter in Baffin Bay (Dietz <em>et al</em>. 2001). The abundance of Eclipse Sound Narwhals in 2013, corrected for both perception and availability biases, was estimated as 10,489 (CV 0.24; Doniol-Valcroze <em>et al</em>. 2015). A previous survey in 2004 produced a higher corrected estimate of 20,225 with wide confidence limits (95% CL 9,471-37,096; Richard <em>et al</em>. 2010). Available data are insufficient to detect any trend in abundance for this subpopulation (Witting 2016). <br/></p>  <p><strong>Eastern Baffin Island</strong></p>  <p>The Eastern Baffin Island Narwhal subpopulation summers in Cumberland Sound and along the Baffin Island coast to the north, and winters in northern Davis Strait (Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2002). Abundance in 2013, corrected for both perception and availability biases, was estimated as 17,555 (CV 0.35; Doniol-Valcroze <em>et al</em>. 2015). Surveys in 2003 that had similar coverage of the eastern Baffin Island fiord area produced a corrected estimate of 10,073 (SE 3,123) Narwhals in the surveyed region (Richard <em>et al</em>. 2010). Available data are insufficient to detect any trend in abundance for this subpopulation (Witting 2016).&#160;  </p><p><strong>Jones Sound</strong></p>  <p>  </p><p>The Jones Sound subpopulation of Narwhals summers between Devon Island and Ellesmere Island and in fiords of western Ellesmere Island. Jones Sound Narwhals have not been tagged and tracked, and their distribution at times of year other than summer is unknown (NAMMCO in prep.). The abundance of Jones Sound Narwhals in 2013, corrected for both perception and availability biases, was estimated as 12,694 (CV 0.33; Doniol-Valcroze <em>et al</em>. 2015). That is the only abundance survey conducted in Jones Sound so <a name=""_Hlk486932453"">there is no information on trend for this subpopulation</a>. </p>    <p><strong>Smith Sound</strong></p>  <p> </p><p>The Smith Sound Narwhal subpopulation summers along the southeastern coast of Ellesmere Island (Richard 2010); its wintering area is unknown. Abundance of Smith Sound Narwhals in 2013, corrected for both perception and availability biases, was estimated as 16,360 (CV 0.65; Doniol-Valcroze <em>et al</em>. 2015). That is the only abundance estimate for Smith Sound so there is no information on trend for this subpopulation. </p>  <p><strong>Inglefield Bredning</strong></p><p>This subpopulation of Narwhals summers in Inglefield Bredning which is its major concentration area in northwestern Greenland (Born <em>et al</em>. 1994). Little is known about distribution at other times of year. Abundance of Inglefield Bredning Narwhals in 2007, corrected for both perception and availability biases, was estimated as 8,368 (CV 0.25; Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2010). Previous surveys of this subpopulation were conducted in 1985-86 (Born <em>et al</em>. 1994) and 2001-02 (Heide‐Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2004) with generally similar results, and abundance appears to be stable (Witting 2016).&#160; <br/></p>  <p><strong>Melville Bay</strong></p>  <p> </p><p>The Melville Bay Narwhal subpopulation spends the ice-free season in and near Melville Bay, and may spend significant time at the fronts of coastal glaciers that are important habitats for them (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2016). With freeze-up they move south to the southern part of Baffin Bay for overwintering (Dietz and Heide-Jørgensen 1995). Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. (2014) reported that the range of Narwhals in Melville Bay contracted over the period from 2007 to 2014. Abundance in 2014, corrected for both perception and availability biases, was estimated as 3,091 (95% CI 1,228-7,783). Previous surveys resulted in estimates of 5,605 whales (95% CI 1,319-23,815) in 2007 and 2,983 (95% CI 1,452-6,127) in 2012 (Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2014). Confidence limits for all three surveys overlap broadly and abundance appears fairly stable (Witting 2016). </p>  <p><strong>Northeast Greenland</strong></p>  <p>Narwhals assigned to the Northeast Greenland subpopulation are frequently seen during May-August in Young Sound (74°N) and along the coast as far north as Nordost Rundingen (82°N; Boertmann <em>et al</em>. 2009). There has been no attempt to estimate abundance of Narwhals in north-eastern Greenland, but surveys of the area were planned for 2017 (NAMMCO in prep.).<strong>&#160; </strong><strong><br/></strong></p>  <p><strong>East Greenland</strong></p>  <p></p><p>In summer Narwhals occur along the east coast of Greenland mostly from about 64° to 72° N, but they have been reported at more than 81° (Dietz <em>et al</em>. 1994), which means the distinction between Northeast and East Greenland Narwhals is uncertain. Narwhals are relatively common in Scoresby Sound and the Kangerlussuaq fjord (Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2010). They winter in sea ice in the Greenland Sea and Fram Strait, but winter observations are sparse (Dietz <em>et al</em>. 1994, Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2015). Aerial surveys conducted in Scoresby Sound in 1983-84 and from Tasiilaq to Scoresby Sound in 2008 and 2016 resulted in conflicting results, leading to the conclusion (as of summer 2017) that Narwhals off East Greenland are widely scattered and may number fewer than 1,000 individuals (NAMMCO in prep.).</p>  <p><strong>Svalbard- Russia</strong><br/></p><p>Narwhals that occur around Svalbard and in the northwestern Russian High Arctic have been little studied but they are thought to be widely distributed in low numbers throughout this region (Heide-Jørgensen 2009). Gjertz (1991) described previous observations and catches that were largely west and north of Svalbard. In August 1998, Lydersen <em>et al</em>. (2007) tagged three subadult Narwhals at Svalbard with satellite-relay data loggers and tracked them for up to 46 days. The whales spent time in fiords in western Svalbard, then moved north and east to deep offshore waters north of 80°N. A survey in the marginal ice zone north of Svalbard in August 2015 produced a corrected estimate of 837 (CV 0.50) Narwhals, but this estimate is negatively biased because the study area did not include the whole range used by Narwhals around Svalbard (Vacquie-Garcia <em>et al</em>. 2017). There are no estimates of abundance for other areas and overall abundance and trend for this subpopulation are unknown (NAMMCO in prep.). &#160;  </p><p><strong>Population Summary</strong></p><p></p><p>The sum of the abundance estimates for the 12 Narwhal subpopulations listed above is 173,134. There is no estimate for Northeast Greenland and the figure for the Svalbard-Russia region is known to be an underestimate because only a portion of the known range was surveyed. If 71% of the overall Narwhal population consists of mature animals (Taylor <em>et al.</em> 2007), the minimum number of mature individuals would be 122,925. The number of mature individuals in the largest subpopulation (Somerset Island) is estimated as 35,335. For the six subpopulations for which there is some information on trend, one is thought to be increasing and five are likely stable. </p>  <p>The generation length for the Narwhal was estimated as 21.9 years by Taylor <em>et al</em>. (2007) and as 30 and 33 years in East and West Greenland, respectively, by Garde <em>et al</em>. (2015) using aspartic acid ageing. Using these estimates, three generations is 66-99 years. For most subpopulations, abundance estimates for years prior to 2000 do not exist, so trends in abundance over a three-generation period cannot be calculated.</p>  <p></p><p>  </p><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><p></p>",Unknown,"Narwhals primarily inhabit the Arctic, including northeastern Canada, northern Greenland, Svalbard, and waters of northern Russia as far east as the East Siberian Sea. Their principal distribution is from the central Canadian Arctic (Peel Sound – Prince Regent Inlet and northern Hudson Bay) eastward to Greenland (Rice 1998). In the Canada-Greenland region in summer, Narwhals spend approximately two months in the high Arctic, largely in bays and fjords; they overwinter in offshore, deep, partially ice-covered habitat along the continental slope (Heide-Jørgensen and Dietz 1995). Narwhals migrate annually between these disjunct seasonal concentration areas, with the migratory periods lasting approximately two months (Koski and Davis 1994, Innes <em>et al</em>. 2002, Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2002, Dietz <em>et al</em>. 2001). Vagrants have been recorded at Newfoundland, the British Isles, Germany, and the Netherlands in the east, and in the Chukchi and Bering seas as far south as the Alaska Peninsula and Commander Islands (Rice 1998).","<p>Narwhals are hunted in Canada and Greenland for human and animal food and for tusk ivory. They supply various staples in the traditional subsistence economy. Today the main products are mattak (skin with some blubber attached) and ivory (Reeves 1993, Reeves and Heide-Jørgensen 1994, Heide-Jørgensen 1994). Narwhal tusks from Canada and Greenland are sold in specialty souvenir markets domestically and are also exported, either as whole tusks or as carved items. </p><p>In the 2008 IUCN Red List assessment (Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 2012), intense hunting of Narwhals (including associated loss due to wounding and sinking) in Greenland and Canada was described as a cause for concern, particularly given the lack of reliable data on hidden mortality and serious injury (see Finley and Miller 1982). Statistics on the number of Narwhals reported as landed by the hunting communities are available starting in the 1950s for Greenland and the 1970s for Canada (NAMMCO in prep.).​ Data summarized by Shadbolt<em> et al</em>. (2015) for the period 2007-2011 show a mean annual retrieved catch of 358 in Greenland and 621 in Canada. The Canadian catch was unusually large due to 624 Narwhals being taken from an ice entrapment event in 2008. Watt and Hall (2016) presented Canadian harvest data that had been corrected for estimated struck and lost. Those data indicate that the total number of Narwhals killed in Canada averaged 620/year (range 515-768) during 2011-2015. <br/></p>",Marine,"<p></p><p>  </p><p>The Narwhal is listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). As a result, a non-detriment finding (NDF; analysis showing that the taking and trade is not detrimental to the species’ survival or to maintenance of the species “throughout its range at a level consistent with its role in the ecosystems in which it occurs”) by the Scientific Authority of the exporting country is required for export. This requirement has had the effect of forcing both Canada and Greenland to document catch and trade levels and to provide data on abundance and trends of hunted Narwhal stocks. Negative NDFs were issued for both countries (Greenland in 2005, Canada in 2010; Shadbolt <em>et al.</em> 2015) making exports of Narwhal ivory from several stocks in Canada illegal for a brief period in 2010-11 and leading to a temporary export ban in Greenland in 2006. This ban remained in effect through at least February 2014 despite the fact that new information reported in 2009 indicated that removal levels for at least some stocks in Greenland were sustainable (Shadbolt <em>et al.</em> 2015). The NAMMCO Scientific Committee Working Group on the Population Status of Narwhal and Beluga in the North Atlantic and the JCNB [Canada/Greenland Joint Commission on Conservation and Management of Narwhal and Beluga] Scientific Working Group meet jointly every other year to review new information on the biology of Narwhals and Belugas, update assessments, and provide advice to the Canada and Greenland governments based, in part, on a catch allocation model designed to ensure the long-term sustainability of removals from the various stocks (NAMMCO 2016, in prep.). Greenland’s annual report to NAMMCO in 2016 (NAMMCO 2017) noted that the NDF for 2016 compared catches and advice for 2013, 2014, and 2015, concluding that, “as a whole, in the period 2013-2015, catches … followed the advice from NAMMCO, JCNB or IWC for all stocks, except Narwhals in Inglefield Bredning, Melville Bay, Ittoqqortormiit and Tasiilaq.”<br/> <br/> The European Union established an import ban on Narwhal tusks in December 2004. This ban apparently was lifted in February 2010 in response to the fact that Greenland had introduced a quota system “based on scientific advice and more accurate population abundance numbers” (Shadbolt <em>et al.</em> 2015).

Substantial bycatch and directed taking, especially in the Peruvian Pacific, is a cause for concern. Very little is known concerning relative abundance or mortality along the Atlantic coast of South America but the situation is believed to be better there than along the Pacific coast.<br/><br/>Burmeister’s Porpoise was classified as Data Deficient (DD) on the IUCN Red List in 2008. It remains extremely data-poor and DD was still considered potentially applicable in this assessment. Clarifying language in the Red List Guidelines (Version 11, 2014) states that: “If the data are so uncertain that both CR and LC are plausible categories, the taxon can be listed as DD”. Although information is sparse, Burmeister’s Porpoise occurs along several thousand kilometres of coastline, and the Critically Endangered category could not plausibly be applied to the species as it is currently defined. Therefore, DD does not apply. The Red List Guidelines also state, ""taxa that are poorly known can often be assigned to a threat category on the basis of background information concerning deterioration of their habitat and/or other causal factors, and in this case the assessor should apply the most plausible category."" <br/><br/>The apparently isolated Peruvian population experiences a relatively high level of threat and may warrant a higher risk category than populations elsewhere in the species' range. For the purposes of the Red List classification, this case of taxonomic uncertainty (the Peruvian group’s genetic distinctiveness possibly signifying that it warrants designation as a separate taxon) is similar to that of <em>Sousa chinensis</em>. In 2008, <em>S. chinensis</em> was listed as Least Concern because of its wide range from western Africa throughout Asia and extending into China. Once the ‘species’ was broken into two (<em>S. chinensis</em> and <em>S. plumbea</em>), each of the species was assessed at higher risk: Vulnerable and Endangered  respectively.&#160;Thus, the taxonomic uncertainty concerning <em>Phocoena spinipinnis</em> gives cause for a precautionary listing until this uncertainty is resolved.<br/><br/>The reports on bycatch rates that are likely to be unsustainable are mainly from the 1990s. The estimated generation length is 14.4 years (Taylor <em>et al.</em> 2007), meaning that these estimates apply to about two generations ago. Although direct catching for crab bait has apparently stopped, the gillnet fisheries have not only persisted but likely increased throughout the range of this species as the human population has increased.&#160;No change in this trend of ongoing or even increased bycatch is anticipated over the coming generation. Therefore, it is more likely than not that a decline is occurring over most of the range where fishing and porpoise distribution overlaps, and such decline is likely to persist or increase over the coming generation.<br/><br/>In consideration of the above, Burmeister's Porpoise is listed as Near Threatened for the following reasons: 1) it occurs in a relatively small and restricted near-shore range, 2) it appears to not be very abundant in the areas where it has been studied, 3) it is susceptible to entanglement in fishing gear and its range coincides with some intensive fisheries, 4) it is experiencing mortality rates that are likely to be causing population declines in some areas, and 5) porpoises in the area with the greatest threats (Peru) may warrant being assigned to their own taxon, which would likely qualify for a threatened category. This listing should be considered provisional because of the limited amount of information available from the majority of the species range. The species therefore comes close to qualifying for Vulnerable under either criterion A3 or A4 (or both), as a decline of at least 30% is plausible over either time period (the next three generations, A3; three generations including the past and future, A4) and the main known cause of the reduction (incidental mortality in fishing gear, subcriterion d) has not ceased and is not likely to cease in the foreseeable future.<br/><br/>In consideration of the above, Burmeister's Porpoise is listed as Near Threatened. This listing should be considered provisional because of the limited amount of information available from the majority of the species’ range. Moreover, Burmeister’s Porpoises in the area with the greatest threats (Peru) may warrant being assigned to their own taxon, which would likely qualify for a threatened category.<br/></p>","<p>Burmeister’s Porpoise is considered a coastal species that frequents inshore bays, channels, and fjords (e.g. Ecoregion Chiloense, Tierra del Fuego), and is occasionally observed inside the kelp line (Goodall <em>et al</em> 1995, N. Dellabianca pers. obs). It is typically found in continental shelf waters, but occasionally has been recorded in water up to 1,000 m deep (Brownell and Clapham 1999). There have also been records from more offshore waters, 50 km from the coast of Argentina. In Peru, an unusual report of a group of 150 individuals was registered 20km offshore (Van Waerebeek <em>et al.</em> 2002).<br/><br/>Available information suggests that Burmeister’s Porpoise  forages on demersal and pelagic fish species, such as anchovy and hake (Reyes and Van Waerebeek 1995), as well as various squids and shrimps (Goodall <em>et al</em>. 1995). Analysis of stomach contents of 69 individuals from central Peru identified Peruvian Anchovy <em>Engraulis ringens</em> as the main prey, followed by Silverside <em>Odontesthes regia</em> (García-Godos <em>et al.</em> 2007). The main prey found in the stomachs of four individuals collected separately were Argentine Anchovy (<em>Engraulis anchoita</em>), Argentine Shortfin Squid (<em>Illex argentinus</em>), Patagonian Squid (<em>Loligo gahi</em>), Argentine Hake (<em>Merluccius hubbsi</em>), Pampanito (<em>Stromateus brasiliensis</em>) and Savorín (<em>Seriolella punctata</em>) (E. Crespo, unpub. data).<br/><br/>Diseases and parasites have been reported for Burmeister’s Porpoises, including helminths such as trematodes and nematodes (Reyes and Van Waerebeek 1995). Poxvirus was first reported in individuals in Pucusana, Peru (Van Bressem <em>et al.</em> 1993), as well as genital warts. The genital lesions were of sufficient severity to affect reproductive success (Van Bressem<em> et al.</em> 1999, 2007).</p>","<p>Until the late 1990s, various species of small cetaceans, including Burmeister´s Porpoise, were harpooned and used as bait in the fisheries for Southern King Crab (Centolla; <em>Lithodes santolla</em>) and False King Crab (Centollón; <em>Paralomis granulosa</em>) in both Argentina and Chile (<a name=""_Hlk509850062"">Lescrauwaet and Gibbons 1994</a>). Because the Centolla was overfished in the Magellan region, fishing effort shifted to the Centollón, which was exploited principally farther west in the channels.<br/><br/>Similarly, in Peru Burmeister’s Porpoises caught in small-scale gillnets are used as bait or for human consumption (Van Waerebeek <em>et al.</em> 1997, Tzika <em>et al.</em> 2010, Mangel <em>et al.</em> 2010, 2013). However, because quantitative data are lacking, the extent of this use and consumption is unknown.<br/><br/>The most extensive known taking of this species occurs in Peruvian waters, where it is by-caught primarily in net fisheries (Alfaro-Shigueto <em>et al.</em> 2010, Mangel <em>et al.</em> 2013), and where it has been used extensively for human consumption. Mortality in Peru was initially estimated at more than 450 individuals per year (Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 1997, Brownell and Clapham 1999). A more recent study estimated the annual bycatch of Burmeister’s Porpoises in gillnet fisheries at one Peruvian port at 205 individuals (95% CI 105-699) (Mangel <em>et al.</em>, 2010) which, given the estimated annual fishing effort well in excess of 100,000 km of nets (Alfaro-Shigueto <em>et al.</em> 2010), suggests that annual mortality at a country level would likely be of several thousand porpoises. There is no information on bycatch rates for other fisheries (e.g., purse seiners, trawlers).<br/><br/>Dedicated surveys in Argentina showed that Dusky (<em>Lagenorhynchus obscurus</em>) and Commerson’s (<em>Cephalorhynchus commersonii</em>) Dolphins were regularly by-caught in mid-water or bottom trawl nets over the Argentine shelf, yet Burmeister’s Porpoises were never reported (Crespo <em>et al</em>. 1997, 2000, 2007). With the banning of night time pelagic trawling and the replacement of pelagic trawlers with twin-beam trawlers, the overall level of by-catch of small cetaceans may now be low in this area (Crespo <em>et al.</em> 2007).</p>  <p>For years, artisanal fishermen from the south of Santa Cruz and Tierra del Fuego have been using various types of gill nets. The main fish species targeted are Snook (<em>Eleginops maclovinus</em>) and Silverside (Atherinidae, several species). Fishing involves setting up networks of stakes in streams and channels, where they work with the tide. The networks may have a single panel or combinations of three panels of netting of different mesh sizes (3, 12 and 30 cm) (Goodall <em>et al</em>. 1988, 1994, Goodall and Schiavini 1995). Beach seine nets are also used, where one end is operated by means of a boat. The marine mammals captured in these nets are Commerson’s and Peale’s (<em>L. australis</em>) Dolphins, as well as Burmeister’s and Spectacled (<em>Phocoena dioptrica</em>) Porpoises occasionally.</p>  <p>Systematic by-catch data do not exist for Chilean waters, but at least some bycatch should be expected to occur anywhere where coastal gillnet fisheries and porpoises overlap. During the 1980s Burmeister’s Porpoises were reported as the most frequently caught cetacean in coastal gillnets in one port in southern Chile (Reyes and Oporto 1994). Occasionally, Burmeister’s Porpoises are by-caught in coastal gillnets around Isla Chiloé, southern Chile (S. Heinrich, pers. observation), and they might also get entangled in anti-predator nets around salmon farms (M. Fuentes, pers. communication).</p>","<p>No comprehensive information on abundance or population trends is available for Burmeister's Porpoises. They are very difficult to detect in any but calm conditions, and even then they are often not recognized or are misidentified. These factors may explain the rarity of field observations (Brownell and Clapham 1999).<br/><br/>Genetic studies have indicated that porpoises in Peru are discrete from those in southern Chile and Argentina. The possibility of multiple subpopulations in Peruvian waters is also considered likely (Rosa <em>et al</em>. 2005). The available evidence suggests that the Burmeister’s Porpoises in the Pacific and Atlantic belong to separate subpopulations (Corcuera <em>et al</em>. 1995). More genetic information, particularly from Chile, is needed to resolve the range-wide population structure.<br/><br/>No systematic abundance surveys for Burmeister’s Porpoises have been undertaken anywhere across their extensive range. The limited information from localized observations on group size, encounter rate and relative abundance suggests that Burmeister’s Porpoises occur in small groups and at low densities in coastal waters in Argentina and Chile.<br/><br/>A total of 37 Burmeister's Porpoises were recorded in 18 aerial surveys (designed for Southern Right Whales) using strip-transect methodology around Península Valdés, Argentina, in an area of 311 km². Average density was estimated at 0.0065 individuals per km<sup>2</sup> (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.004-0.1). The average group size was 1.6 animals (95% CI 1.26-2.04) (Sueyro <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>Encounter rates estimated from dedicated vessel surveys in the Ecoregion Chiloense (southern Chile) varied from 0.1 animals per 100km of survey effort in shallow areas (&lt;60 m deep) to 2.5 animals per 100 km in areas with more variable bathymetry (&lt;200 m deep), with an average group size of 2.4 animals (95% CI 2.2-2.7, n=124 observations) (S. Heinrich, unpub. data).</p>",Unknown,"Burmeister's Porpoises are distributed in coastal waters of South America, from southern Brazil (about 28°48’S), south to Cape Horn in Tierra del Fuego, and thence north to northern Peru (to about 5°01’S) (Brownell and Clapham 1999). It remains unclear whether the distribution is continuous between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, although Gibbons <em>et al.</em> (2002) reported that occurrence of this porpoise is rare in the Fuegian channels, suggesting that the resident population in the Beagle Channel originated from the Atlantic Ocean population.","<p>From at least the 1970s until the early 1990s many small cetacean species, including Burmeister’s Porpoises, were hunted for crab bait in the Magellan region and in Tierra del Fuego (Argentina and Chile) (Lescrauwaet and Gibbons 1994). The scale of these directed takes was large enough to cause conservation concern as abundance of all small cetaceans in this region appeared noticeably reduced. In the early 1990s, alternative bait sources became available and conservation measures were introduced by the Chilean government that seem to have had some effect (Lescrauwaet and Gibbons 1994, Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2003). There is currently no direct evidence to suggest that wide-spread directed taking of any small cetacean species continues in Chile, even though dolphins and porpoises accidentally caught in nets might still be used as bait.<br/><br/>In Peru, however, Burmeister’s Porpoises have been hunted frequently as wild meat for human consumption, and they are consumed either directly at sea or brought to shore and sold at local markets (Van Waerebeek <em>et al.</em> 1999, Tzika <em>et al.</em> 2010, Mangel <em>et al</em>., 2010). Some studies suggest that that Burmeister’s Porpoise is the preferred small-cetacean meat for human consumption (Mangel <em>et al. </em>2010, 2013). Peruvian fishermen also use porpoise meat as bait in shark fisheries (i.e., for Blue and Mako Sharks) (Mangel <em>et al.</em> 2010). The porpoises are hunted with harpoons or are used after they have drowned accidentally in fishing gear (Van Waerebeek <em>et al.</em> 1999, Alfaro-Shigueto <em>et al.</em> 2010, Mangel <em>et al.</em> 2010, 2013).</p>",Marine,"<p>Burmeister's Porpoise is in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and Appendix II of the Bonn Convention (Convention on Management of Migratory Species - CMS).<br/><br/>Further research is urgently needed to provide abundance estimates for a representative proportion of the species’ total range, and more up-to-date, quantitative information on human-caused mortality as well as information on ecology and reproductive biology.<br/><br/>Acoustic deterrents (pingers) were tested as a mitigation measure to reduce bycatch in small-scale driftnets in Peru, and showed a reduction of 37% in the combined dolphin and porpoise bycatch (Mangel <em>et al.</em> 2013). Updated information on bycatch rates and use of the species is a priority. Innovative approaches (e.g., vessel monitoring systems (Bartholomew <em>et al</em>. 2018) and passive acoustic methods) to reduce porpoise/gillnet interactions are clearly needed in order to reduce the incidental catch of Burmeister's Porpoises in fisheries.</p>",Neotropical,,false,false,Global
50374282,20731,Stenella coeruleoalba,Least Concern,,2019,2018-04-19 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The Striped Dolphin is one of the most abundant cetaceans in tropical, subtropical, and temperate waters around the globe. The sum of available abundance estimates totals more than two million individuals. Estimates are unavailable for most of the species range, particularly in the eastern Atlantic, Indian Ocean, and large portions of the tropical Pacific and therefore total abundance is likely much higher. There is little quantitative information on bycatch rates in most range states, but bycatch certainly occurs in much of the species’ range. Recent evidence suggests that bycatch levels are low in purse seine fisheries of the eastern tropical Atlantic and in the western Indian Ocean. The species has suffered two epizootics in the Mediterranean that caused the deaths of thousands of individuals. Direct removals are substantial in a few areas, notably drive hunts in Japan. The Mediterranean subpopulation of Striped Dolphins is currently listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List because of a suspected reduction in population size of &gt;30% that occurred over the last three generations (approximately&#160;60 years) (criterion A2) based on a 2/3 reduction in mean school size (A2b), a decline in quality of habitat, particularly food availability (A2c), past and current high levels of exploitation in the form of incidental mortality in fisheries (A2d), and the effects of pathogens and pollutants (A2e). </p>Globally, the species remains widely distributed and abundant and it is unlikely that the global population has been, or will be, reduced by as much as 30% over three generations. Striped Dolphins were classified as Least Concern (LC) on the Red List in 2008, and although the species is data-poor in much of its range, given its generally high abundance and pantropical distribution, and in the absence of evidence that threats are significant throughout its extensive range, the Striped Dolphin is again assessed as LC.","<p>Striped Dolphins occur primarily in warm temperate, subtropical, and tropical oceanic regions far from shore. They are seen close to shore only where deep water approaches the coast (Jefferson <em>et al.</em> 2015, Archer 2018). In the North Pacific, Striped Dolphins are associated with oligotrophic waters of the central North Pacific gyre and with more productive upwelling areas in the ETP and along the edges of the California and Kuroshio Current systems (Miyazaki <em>et al</em>. 1974, Reilly 1990, Archer and Perrin 1999, Ballance <em>et al</em>. 2006). In the western North Atlantic, Striped Dolphins appear to prefer continental slope waters offshore of the Gulf Stream (Leatherwood <em>et al</em>. 1976, Schmidly 1981, Perrin <em>et al</em>. 1994). In the Mediterranean, they are associated with highly productive, oceanic waters beyond the continental shelf (Notarbartolo di Sciara <em>et al</em>. 1993, Forcada <em>et al</em>. 1994, Frantzis <em>et al</em>. 2003, Gannier 2005, Panigada <em>et al.</em> 2008). Off South Africa, the species is oceanic, occurring beyond the continental shelf at depths of over 1,000 m, and its distribution is correlated with the warm Agulhas Current (Ross 1984). Within the Mediterranean, there is some evidence of population structure based on restricted gene flow and significant differences in tissue pollutant levels between areas (Calzada and Aguilar 1995, Monaci <em>et al</em>. 1998, Gaspari 2004). The species has been reported in waters from 10°C to 26°C, although most records are from about 18°C to 22°C (Archer and Perrin 1999).<br/> <br/>The diet of Striped Dolphins consists of a wide variety of small, midwater and pelagic or benthopelagic organisms, especially lanternfish, cod, and squid (Wurtz and Marrale 1993, Hassani <em>et al</em>. 1997, Archer 2018). Striped Dolphins feed in pelagic to benthopelagic zones, to depths as deep as 200-700 m, in continental slope or oceanic regions.</p>","<p>The largest directed catches of Striped Dolphins have been in Japanese waters, in drive and hand-harpoon fisheries that date back to at least the Meiji period (1868-1912). Catch statistics are incomplete before 1978, but reported annual recorded catches between 1978 and 1993 ranged between 1,000 and 4,000, except for 1990 when 16,344 were reported as killed (Kasuya 2017). An annual quota of 1,000 Striped Dolphins was established in 1992, this was lowered to 725 in 1993, and there have been minor annual decreases since 2006 (Kasuya 2017). It is likely that the Japanese coastal population of Striped Dolphins suffered the highest mortality, but there is evidence based on mercury concentrations that other populations were also represented (Kasuya 1999, 2017).</p>  <p>In Taiwan, Striped Dolphins are harpooned opportunistically but these are rare events (John Wang pers. comm.). Striped Dolphins have also been taken in the drive fishery at Malaita in the Solomon Islands but they do not form a large proportion of the catch, which typically targets Spinner (<em>Stenella longirostris</em>) and Pantropical Spotted (<em>Stenella attenuata</em>) Dolphins (Oremus <em>et al.</em> 2015, Ross <em>et al</em>. 2003). &#160;Striped Dolphins have been taken by harpoon and gillnet in Sri Lanka (Ilangakoon <em>et al</em>. 2000a,b) and St. Vincent and the Grenadines (Perrin <em>et al</em>. 1994).<br/> <br/> At least until the mid 2000s illegal catches occurred in southern Spain and probably in other areas (SGFEN 2001, Aguilar 2006).</p>  <p>Striped Dolphins are killed accidentally in fishing gear throughout their range, however data are limited for most range states. Mortality occurs in purse seines and gillnets, large mesh pelagic driftnets, and pelagic longline fisheries, and has been documented in the northeastern Indian Ocean, the eastern tropical Pacific, the northeastern Atlantic, the Mediterranean, and in the North Pacific off the coast of Japan (Archer and Perrin 1999). Although rare, Striped Dolphins have been caught in shark nets at&#160;Natal,&#160;South Africa (Perrin <em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;"">et al</em>. 1994). Between 1985 and 1988 Striped Dolphins comprised 14% of the cetaceans brought in to fish landing sites in Sri Lanka (Ilangakoon 1997).</p>  <p>High seas drift gillnet fisheries operated throughout the central and western North Pacific between about 35˚N and 47˚N, increased during the 1970s, and peaked during the 1980s before a United Nations moratorium came into effect in January 1993. Striped Dolphin mortality was highest in the Japanese large-mesh drift net fishery, with about 3,000 individuals taken in 1990 (Hobbs and Jones 1993). During the 1970s and 1980s, the high-seas driftnet fisheries likely killed tens of thousands of Striped Dolphins in total, but this mortality was not considered to have been high enough to cause population declines (Hobbs and Jones 1993). In recent years, fishery-related mortality of Striped Dolphins along the U.S. east and west coasts, in Hawaii, and in the Gulf of Mexico has been low, and is considered sustainable (Carretta <em>et al.</em> 2017, Waring <em>et al.</em> 2013).</p>  <p>Pelagic driftnets have been a major source of mortality of Striped Dolphins in the western Mediterranean in the past (Tudela <em>et al.</em> 2004). Such nets are still illegally used by Moroccan, French, Italian, and Turkish vessels, resulting in extensive dolphin mortality (Akyol <em>et al.</em> 2012, Silvani <em>et al.</em> 1999, Tudela <em>et al.</em> 2004). The Spanish driftnet fishery in the Alborán Sea reportedly killed 145-183 Striped Dolphins per season in the early 1990s (Silvani <em>et al</em>. 1999); this fishery was halted in 1995 but the nets were transferred to Moroccan boats, which were estimated to kill in the order of 1,555-2,092 Striped Dolphins in 2003 (Tudela <em>et al</em>. 2004). In 1999 and 2000, Striped Dolphins were the most commonly killed cetacean species in the Turkish driftnet Swordfish fishery (Akyol <em>et al.</em> 2012, Öztürk <em>et al.</em> 2001). The Italian driftnet fishery reportedly killed 5,000-15,000 dolphins, mostly Striped Dolphins, per year in the 1980s (Di Natale 1992). The French thonaille driftnet fishery was estimated to take about 180-472 Striped Dolphins per season in year 2000 (Imbert <em>et al</em>. 2001). </p>  <p>Large incidental kills in pelagic trawl and driftnet fisheries off western Europe were a source of concern in the 1990s (IWC 1998, Tregenza and Collet 1998). Results from an observer programme on a driftnet fishery in the eastern North Atlantic in 1996 and 1998 documented marine megafauna mortality rates (Rogan <em>et al.</em> 2007). Using landings of Albacore Tuna as an indicator of effort, the extrapolated decadal data from driftnet fleets operating in this region estimated that over the period 1990–2000 24,358 dolphins were killed, of which 12,635 (10,009–15,261) were Striped Dolphins (Rogan <em>et al.</em> 2007). In the southwestern Atlantic, bycatch of Striped Dolphins was noted by Zerbini and Kotas (1998) off Brazil.</p>  <p>Tissue levels of organochlorine compounds, some heavy metals and selenium in Mediterranean Striped Dolphins are high and exceed ‘safe’ threshold levels for mammals (Cardellicchio <em>et al</em>. 2000, Monaci <em>et al</em>. 1998, Aguilar 2000, Storelli <em>et al</em>. 2012). Organochlorine levels, in particular, greatly exceed thresholds of reproductive impairment in Bottlenose Dolphins (<em>Tursiops</em> spp.) elsewhere (Aguilar 2006, Storelli <em>et al.</em> 2012, Munson <em>et al</em>. 1998). Blubber concentrations of DDT and PCB, the two main organochlorine pollutants, may be declining slowly (Aguilar and Borrell 2005) but were still high in many parts of the Mediterranean in the early 2000s (Storelli <em>et al</em>. 2012). Extremely high concentrations of heavy metals, DDT and PCBs have also been reported in specimens from Japan (Tanabe <em>et al</em>. 1983). </p>  <p>Mass mortality events involving Striped Dolphins in the Mediterranean Sea occurred during 1990-1992 and 2006-2007, both caused by morbillivirus infection (Domingo <em>et al</em>. 1990, Keck <em>et al</em>. 2010). These epizootics resulted in many thousands of deaths and devastated the Mediterranean Striped Dolphin population (Bortolotto <em>et al</em>. 1992, Aguilar and Raga 1993, Raga <em>et al.</em> 2008). The primary immediate cause of the die-offs was the disease. PCBs and other organochlorine pollutants with the potential for immunosuppressive effects might have played a role in, or enhanced the spread and lethality of, the first event (Aguilar and Borrell 1994). However, data from the second event did not support that hypothesis (Castrillon <em>et al.</em> 2010).</p>  Commercially exploited fish and cephalopod species are important components of Striped Dolphin diet in the Mediterranean (Pulcini <em>et al</em>. 1993, Blanco <em>et al</em>. 1995). As many of those stocks (e.g., European Anchovies) have been depleted by commercial fisheries, reduced prey availability is a potentially significant threat to the Striped Dolphin population (Aguilar 2006) and may have contributed to the 1990-1992 epizootic (Aguilar 2000). <br/> <br/> In 2004 and 2005, two unusual strandings in Taiwan included Striped Dolphins (Wang and Yang 2006). The cause(s) of the deaths of these animals were not been determined but human (but non-fishing) activities were likely responsible.","<p>Striped Dolphin abundance in the western North Pacific was estimated as 570,000 (coefficient of variation (CV) = 19%) based on sighting data collected during 1983-1991 (Miyashita 1993). Two areas of Striped Dolphin concentration were identified, one between 20° and 30°N with about 52,682 animals (CV = 95%) and the other between 30° and 40°N with about 497,725 (CV = 18%) animals. In the nearshore waters of Japan, 19,631 Striped Dolphins (CV = 70%) were estimated (Kasuya 1999). </p>  <p>In the eastern tropical Pacific (ETP), a 2003 line-transect survey estimated 1,470,854 individuals (CV = 15%) (Gerrodette <em>et al</em>. 2005). The most recent estimate of abundance for waters of California-Oregon-Washington in the U.S.A., calculated from the geometric mean of estimates from 2008 and 2014 summer/autumn vessel-based line-transect surveys, was 29,211 (CV = 0.20) animals (Barlow 2016, Carretta <em>et al.</em> 2017). This estimate includes correction factors for animals missed during the surveys. Abundance along the U.S. west coast varies seasonally, but no long-term trends have been detected (Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2017). A 2010 shipboard line-transect survey of the Hawaiian Islands EEZ resulted in an abundance estimate of 20,650 (CV = 0.36) Striped Dolphins (Bradford <em>et al.</em> 2013, Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2017). </p>  <p>The total number of Striped Dolphins off the U.S. and Canadian Atlantic coasts is unknown, although several estimates from specific regions for certain time periods are available (Waring <em>et al</em>. 2013). Sightings are almost exclusively in the continental shelf edge and slope areas west of Georges Bank. The best estimate for Striped Dolphins in the western North Atlantic is 54,807 (CV = 0.3) from a 2011 survey (Waring<em> et al.</em> 2014). The best available estimate for the northern Gulf of Mexico is 1,849 (CV = 0.77) from a summer 2009 survey covering waters from the 200-m isobath to the seaward extent of the U.S. EEZ (Waring <em>et al.</em> 2013). </p>  <p>Ballance and Pitman (1998) reported that the Striped Dolphin was the second-most abundant species sighted in the western tropical Indian Ocean (14% of all cetaceans, compared to 33% for the ETP and 10% for the Gulf of Mexico). </p>  <p>Aerial and ship-board line transect surveys of European Atlantic waters in summer 2016 resulted in an estimate of 372,340 (CV = 33%) for the Striped Dolphin, which was the third most abundant species recorded. Striped Dolphins were strongly concentrated in offshore waters (Hammond <em>et al.</em> 2017).The Striped Dolphin is the most abundant cetacean in the Mediterranean Sea. Abundance in the western Mediterranean, excluding the Tyrrhenian Sea, was estimated in 1991 at 117,880 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 68,379-214,800) (Forcada <em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 9pt;"">et al</em>. 1994). There is no estimate for the eastern Mediterranean Sea.

97204446,15309,Leopardus colocolo,Near Threatened,,2016,2014-04-22 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Pampas Cat is generally rare or very rare (0.05-0.2 individuals/km²) and localized throughout most of its range, and appears to be declining in several parts of its extent of occurrence because of extensive loss or reduction in quality of its habitat. Predation by dogs, hunting and road kills are additional threats. Population decline caused by loss of habitat is widespread and is a primary concern. Although little data is available on the rate of loss of natural habitats across the Pampas Cat range, we have some information from the Gran Chaco region that covers a large portion of Pampas Cat’s distribution range. The Gran Chaco forest extends over parts of northern Argentina, western Paraguay, eastern Bolivia, and western Brazil and occupies an approximate area of 1,141,000 km². Deforestation started in the 1970s and accelerated in 2002-2006. Following the global increase in commodity prices, it is likely that the rates of deforestation have maintained or increased in the last decade. Based on the data from the dry Chaco region, a portion of the whole Gran Chaco covering 790,000 km²&#160; the yearly rate of transformation of forest into cropland (a habitat type where Pampas Cat do not occur) ranges from 0.63 to 1.75% (Clark <em>et al.</em> 2010). Thus, adopting a generation length of seven years (Pacifici <em>et al.</em> 2013) and assuming that transformed habitat becomes unavailable to the Pampas Cat, populations of this species could be suffering a 36.5% declination rate over three generations.<br/><br/>Another issue is that possibly the Pampas Cat should not be assessed as a single evolutionary unit. The taxonomy of this species is not yet resolved but the available evidence (morphological, genetic and ecological) indicates that there are clear differences among regional subpopulations, which have been proposed to represent distinct subspecies or even species. It is reasonable to consider the conservation status of these regional populations separately, because there may be little (or even no) historical and/or current gene flow among some of them, implying that limited genetic connectivity may further threaten the long term viability of the species as a whole.<br/><br/>Because of all the above and because the reasons for its rarity and population numbers are not known, the limited information available indicates Near Threatened as the most likely category (it almost qualifies for a threatened listing under criterion A2c). Nevertheless, it may qualify as Vulnerable in the near future and hence requires monitoring.","The Pampas Cat has a wide distribution outside the moist forests of South America, being associated with more open habitats. It typically inhabits dry scrub and grassland, but can also be found in dry woodland as well as swampy wetland and rocky areas (Silveira 1995, Nowell and Jackson 1996, Pereira <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2002, Tellaeche 2015). Its prey includes small mammals as well as ground-dwelling birds (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Silveira <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005). In the high Andes the diet is based on mountain viscacha and small rodents (Walker <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2007, Napolitano <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008, Fajardo <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014). In Brazil's Emas National Park, Pampas cats are primarily diurnal with some crepuscular and occasionally nocturnal activity. Home ranges (90% MCP) averaged 19.47 +/- 3.64 km² (Silveira <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005). In the High Andes 71% of camera trap photos were taken at night and more than 20% during the day (Lucherini <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2009) and average home range size (95% Kernel) was 14.9 km² (Tellaeche 2015).","Habitat loss (to agricultural cropland) and degradation (by livestock grazing) is considered the major threat to this species throughout most of its range. Retaliatory killing for poultry depredation is also a threat, as are road kills.<br/><br/>In the High Andes of Bolivia and Peru the Pampas Cat is threatened by decreasing habitat quality caused by increased anthropogenic modification. In these regions, it is also actively persecuted by local people and often killed by dogs.<br/><br/>In Argentina, extensive habitat loss/modification due to the expansion of the agriculture frontier, mining, and oil extraction is the major threat.<br/><br/>The biggest threat to the species in Brazil is habitat loss, especially because of silviculture and agriculture expansion, as well as habitat conversion/degradation, mostly through fire. Given its rarity in Brazil, road kills are also considered a threat for some populations. In the Brazilian Pampas, predation by domestic dogs and hunting due to real or perceived conflicts, a problem that apparently has not been detected in the Cerrado yet (where it would be more incidental than widespread). A zone of hybridization between <em>L. colocolo</em> and <em>L. tigrinus</em> has been demonstrated by genetic analysis in central Brazil (Trigo <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008).<br/><br/>In Peru, it is actively persecuted as it often kills chickens of local people, and is also impacted by dogs. Forest loss appears to be also an important threat.","The Pampas Cat populations living in the High Andes and Puna eco-regions appear to be able to reach relatively high densities (0.74-0.78 individuals/km<sup>2</sup>) in the most productive habitat patches (Gardner <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010). The population appears to be stable in these regions of Argentina and in slight decline in Bolivia and Peru because of decreasing habitat quality caused by increased anthropogenic modification.<br/><br/>The Pampas Cat is a naturally rare species in most of Patagonia, where records of its presence are scarce in comparison with those of other felids (e.g. Geoffroy´s Cat, Puma).<br/><br/>In the Argentine Mesopotamia (Corrientes province), a couple of records (road-killed animals) were obtained during the last decade, but almost no evidence was recorded through camera trapping for the Iberá wetlands in spite of intensive trapping effort, thus suggesting that the species is rare in this region.<br/><br/>The Pampas Cat appears to be declining in central Argentina (Cordoba, San Luis), mainly due to habitat modification (i.e. soybean crop expansion), and is regionally extinct in the Pampas grasslands, where it only occurs in the southern and dry portion (Pereira <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2002 and recent unpublished surveys). In the Argentine Espinal, population numbers are low (0.11-0.17 individuals/ km<sup>2</sup>, lower than for the Geoffroy’s Cat, Caruso <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2012) and distribution is largely limited to grassland habitats that are threatened by human activities. Pampas cat are similarly rare in the adjacent southern part of the Monte eco-region (Pereira <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2011).<br/><br/>Pampas Cat records are very scarce in the Yungas eco-region of NW Argentina, where it is limited to the high-altitude grasslands (Di Bitetti <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2011).<br/><br/>A survey on small cats has found no records of Pampas Cats in the Bolivian Chaco dry forest (Cuellar <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2006).<br/><br/>In Brazil, the Pampas Cat inhabits open areas, such as the grasslands of the Pampas, the marshy Pantanal, and particularly the savannas of the Cerrado (Araujo Bagno 2004). The species is considered typically rare and with low population densities, typically of 0.01–0.05 individuals/km<sup>2</sup> (or lower), throughout these regions, but may be relatively common in a few areas, usually protected, such as Emas National Parks in the Cerrado (Godoi <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010), and Mirador State Park, where densities of 0.1–0.2 individuals/km<sup>2</sup> are reached (Oliveira <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010, Oliveira 2011).<br/><br/>In the Brazilian Pampas (southern portion of Rio Grande do Sul [RS] state), this felid is considered to occur only in well-preserved habitats areas (whose remaining area covers ca. 81,500 km²), and is always rarer than Geoffroy’s Cat.<br/><br/>Habitat loss and population decline is expected to be 14% in the next 21 years or three generations (assuming the same generation length of seven years). Because of this, the species was considered Vulnerable (C1) in Brazil (Queirolo <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2013). The situation is thought to be the same in Uruguay.<br/><br/>An interesting point revealed by recent molecular studies is that the populations in RS state (Brazilian pampas) and Uruguay are genetically distinct from those present in the Brazilian Cerrado and also from Argentinean populations, indicating that they have been demographically isolated for a considerable period (Santos, Trigo and Eizirik, in preparation). Such a result indicates that this region constitutes a distinct conservation unit for this species, which should be taken into consideration when assessing its overall status.<br/><br/>In Peru, the Pampas Cat is generally uncommon or rare. A seemingly separate subpopulation of Pampas Cat occurs in the Tumbesian region of western Ecuador and northwestern Peru. Individuals here are small and well-marked compared with the Andean form. This form inhabits mainly forested habitats, favoring dense vegetation along permanent water-courses and even in mangroves. It also occurs in agricultural fields, especially sugar cane plantations and in sparse desert habitats with little vegetation along the coast where shorebirds congregate. In this region, the high level of human impacts and settlement has resulted in widespread forest loss and the Pampas Cat is now extremely rare, being primarily found in protected areas.<br/><br/>Most of its subpopulations, which could in fact end up being considered as genetically different species, would be Vulnerable individually.",Decreasing,"The Pampas Cat, named after Argentine grasslands, ranges throughout most of Argentina and Uruguay beyond into the dry forests (chaco, cerrado) of Bolivia, Paraguay and Brazil, and north through the Andes mountain chain through Ecuador and possibly marginally into southwestern Colombia (Silveira 1995, Ruiz-Garcia <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2003, Nowell and Jackson 1996, Dotta <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2007).<br/><br/>The suggestion by Pereira <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> (2002) that the species can be considered extinct in the Pampas of central Argentina has been confirmed by more recent surveys.<br/><br/>The most recent information indicates that this species is rare throughout a very large portion of its distribution range, such as the Patagonia, Monte, Espinal, Yungas, and Mesopotamia in Argentina, the Pampas and Pantanal in Brazil, the dry forests of Bolivia, as well as in Uruguay and Peru.","In Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and Perú people of Aymara origin, and in some cases Quechua, have similar beliefs regarding the Andean Cat and Pampas Cat (both known as titi or osqollo). A common tradition is the use of a skin or a stuffed cat during ceremonies that people perform for marking their domestic livestock, mainly llamas or alpacas; the titi is considered a sacred animal related with abundance and fertility of the livestock or quality of crops. It is important to note that both the Andean Cat and Pampas Cat are part of these traditions and beliefs, and in general, are used indistinctively. There are some local variations within and between countries and in some cases the influence of western culture has resulted in a total or partial loss of the values of Andean cultures and the distortion of ancestral customs regarding the titi (Villalba&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/>Cossios&#160;<em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">.

145357488,18596,Pseudorca crassidens,Near Threatened,A2d,2018,2018-07-23 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>False Killer Whales are widely distributed in tropical, subtropical, and warm temperate waters of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, but they are not common anywhere. They occur at highest densities in tropical areas, but even there are generally among the less common delphinids. The sum of existing abundance estimates is 59,157 animals, although the two largest estimates (accounting for approximately 94% of the total number) are more than 25 years old. No abundance estimates are available for a substantial part of the range of the species, and therefore total abundance is likely much higher than 60,000. Because of these whales’ low density, abundance estimates are imprecise, and thus there is no ability to assess trends in most areas.<br/><br/>False Killer Whales feed on fish species that are targeted by major high-value fisheries, including tunas and billfishes, and they regularly engage in depredation on both catch and bait in hook-and-line fisheries. This makes them both more vulnerable to bycatch in hook-and-line fisheries and to reductions in available prey than most species of cetaceans with similar distributions, as these other species tend to feed on small mesopelagic fish and squid or on deep-water prey such as squid.<br/><br/>The primary threats to False Killer Whales are incidental mortality (“bycatch”) in fisheries and, in some areas, directed hunting or culling. Generation length has been estimated at 25 years. Because of their life history, even low levels of bycatch or directed takes could result in population declines. Numbers taken in directed hunts in Japan have likely been great enough to reduce nearshore populations, and False Killer Whales are at least occasionally targeted in direct hunts in a few other parts of their range (Indonesia and West Indies). Bycatch is greatest in longline and other hook-and-line fisheries, but some mortality also occurs in gillnet and seine fisheries. In Hawaii, one area where they have been studied extensively, there is strong evidence of multiple subpopulations, and these have been recognized under U.S. law as separate stocks. Bycatch of the Hawaii pelagic stock in the U.S. longline fishery has been at a level thought to be high enough to limit population growth for most years since bycatch rates and abundance estimates have been available. This is a transboundary stock and foreign fleets account for the majority of longline effort in surrounding international waters, thus total bycatch levels are likely much higher than indicated by the U.S. observer program. Bycatch is known to occur in other areas but limited or no observer coverage in most fisheries and lack of abundance estimates precludes quantitative assessment of bycatch levels in relation to abundance. The only stock that has been quantitatively assessed (the main Hawaiian Islands insular stock) was estimated to have had a &gt;50% decline in abundance in less than two generations (Oleson <em>et al</em>. 2010), with fishery interactions (primarily hooking and entanglement) thought to be the most important threat.<br/><br/>False Killer Whales were listed as Data Deficient on the IUCN Red List in 2008, and the species remains data-poor for most of its range. The Red List Guidelines (Version 13, 2017) note that a taxon that comes close to qualifying for the Vulnerable (VU) category based on the Vulnerable thresholds qualifies for the Near Threatened (NT) category. This consideration combined with biological susceptibility and threat strengthens the case for a NT listing. A 30% or greater decline in three generations based on category A2(d) – a population reduction observed, estimated, inferred, or suspected, based on actual or potential levels of exploitation – qualifies a taxon for the Vulnerable category. The False Killer Whale comes close to meeting the criteria for VU for the following reasons: 1) there has been an estimated population decline of &gt;50% in two generations in the one population that has been quantitatively assessed, with the primary cause thought to be fishery interactions; 2) bycatch is a widespread threat at levels suspected to be large enough to result in population reduction throughout much of the taxon’s range, and levels of fishing effort are unlikely to decline substantially in the near future; 3) levels of directed take in some areas are likely high enough to have reduced local populations; and 4) biological susceptibility to population-level effects of bycatch exists given the life history of these whales, the overlap of their diet with the target species of high-value commercial fisheries, and their tendency to engage in depredation on catch and bait in hook-and-line fisheries. Given the above, False Killer Whales are therefore assessed as NT. Although the rangewide decline could be large enough for the species to qualify for VU, collecting the data necessary to quantify the extent of decline for a globally distributed, pelagic species is very difficult. Risk levels could be better assessed at the subpopulation level and efforts should be made toward that end.</p>","<p>While False Killer Whales occur in tropical, sub-tropical, and at least occasionally in warm temperate waters worldwide (Stacey <em>et al</em>. 1994, Odell and McClune 1999), their density is highest in the tropics (Ferguson and Barlow 2003). They are generally found in relatively deep, offshore waters, but individuals do approach close to shore around oceanic islands (e.g., Hawaii). Individuals from the main Hawaiian Islands resident subpopulation use both shallow (&lt;100 m) and deep (to 4,700 m) waters around the Hawaiian archipelago (Baird 2016). Some animals may move into shallow and higher latitude waters seasonally (e.g., off New Zealand; Zaeschmar 2014) or periodically (including some semi-enclosed seas such as the Red Sea and the Mediterranean). Individuals have been documented spending extended periods of time (two to three months) in shallow water areas of the Timor and Arafura seas (Palmer <em>et al</em>. 2009, 2017). Individuals and groups have been reported to enter rivers on the Chinese mainland (Zhou <em>et al</em>. 1995), but it was not clear whether these occurrences might have represented pre-stranding behaviour.<br/><br/>False Killer Whales eat primarily relatively large fish and cephalopods (Alonso <em>et al</em>. 1999). They have been known to attack and consume small dolphins that have been injured or disoriented when released from tuna purse seine nets, but this behavior may be more akin to learning to take advantage of opportunistic food sources than to a predilection to feed on other species of marine mammals (Baird 2018). They eat some large species of fish, such as Mahimahi (also called Dorado or Dolphinfish), Yellowfin Tuna, Skipjack Tuna, Albacore Tuna, Opah, Wahoo, pomphrets, Broadbill Swordfish and Sailfish (Oleson <em>et al.</em> 2010). In Hawaiian waters observational studies suggest that large pelagic game fish (Mahimahi, tunas, billfishes) form the majority of their diet (Baird <em>et al</em>. 2008, Baird 2016). Depredation data on longline-caught fish suggest a preference for billfishes, Wahoo and tunas over Mahimahi, pomfrets, Walu, sharks or lancetfishes (Oleson <em>et al.</em> 2010).</p><p></p>","<p>False Killer Whales are long-lived, slow to reproduce, upper-trophic level predators, and as such are subject to effects of a number of different anthropogenic stressors. The overlap of their diet with species targeted by fisheries, in particular high-value species such as tunas and billfishes, results in a number of types of interactions that can reduce local populations, although the sparseness of observer coverage in most hook-and-line and other fisheries within the range of False Killer Whales limits the information available. In addition, the False Killer Whale is one of several species known to mass strand (Caldwell <em>et al. </em>1970, Alonso <em>et al.</em> 1999, Liebig <em>et al.</em> 2007), with the largest known mass stranding of 835 individuals in Argentina in 1946 (Caillet-Bois 1948). Such mass strandings have the potential to affect local populations.<br/><br/>False Killer Whales are hooked in longline fisheries as they engage in depredation on both the catch and bait (Hernandez-Milian <em>et al</em>. 2008, Thode <em>et al</em>. 2016). The U.S. Hawaii-based deep-set longline fishery has had approximately 20% observer coverage since 2001, and has provided detailed information on bycatch rates. In this fishery, False Killer Whales are the most frequently recorded species of cetacean hooked as bycatch (Forney and Kobayashi 2005, Bradford and Forney 2014). The first abundance estimates became available for the Hawaii pelagic stock in 2003 (Barlow 2006, Bradford <em>et al</em>. 2014b), and documented mortality and serious injury inside the U.S. EEZ surrounding the Hawaiian Archipelago exceeded the potential biological removal (PBR) level for 10 of the 12 years from 2003-2015 (Carretta <em>et al</em>.&#160;2013,&#160;2017). Rates of hooking or entanglement are approximately 1.5 individuals for every 1 million hooks set. This is a transboundary population and non-U.S. fisheries outside the U.S. EEZ surrounding the Hawaiian Archipelago represent the majority of longline effort, thus bycatch rates for the entire Hawaii pelagic stock are likely much higher than estimated. Non-lethal but potentially significant injuries (such as those that compromise health and ability to reproduce) may also occur if animals are hooked (Baird and Gorgone 2005, Baird <em>et al</em>. 2014, Alves <em>et al</em>. 2018). The rate of non-lethal line-related injuries is significantly higher in the main Hawaiian Islands insular stock than in the Hawaii pelagic stock (Baird <em>et al</em>. 2014). The main Hawaiian Islands insular stock has only limited overlap with the longline fishery, but there are no observers in the nearshore fisheries, and thus no bycatch estimates are available. Longline fisheries occur throughout the central and western tropical Pacific, and similar interactions with False Killer Whales occur in other regions (e.g., Indian Ocean, Kiszka <em>et al</em>. 2010, Anderson 2014; American Samoa, Bradford and Forney 2014; Mediterranean, Bearzi 2002; western North Atlantic, Waring <em>et al</em>. 2015). Observers on Spanish longline vessels documented two bycaught False Killer Whales off the Azores in 2006 in approximately 810,000 observed hooks (Hernandez-Milian <em>et al</em>. 2008), a rate similar to the Hawaii-based longline fishery. The incidental catch rate (including animals hooked but released alive) was estimated from 1992-2005 from observers in the Spanish longline fleet at 1.464, 1.685, and 0.797 individuals per million hooks for the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans, respectively (Ramos-Cartelle and Mejuto 2008.) Observer programs to monitor bycatch in fisheries in most parts of the world are limited (if they exist at all), but given what is known regarding both the abundance of False Killer Whales and their predilection to take fish off lines, there is certainly potential for bycatch to result in population declines.</p>  <p>Based on observer reports, False Killer Whales were the most frequently reported species of cetacean killed in the tropical western and central Pacific purse seine fishery in 2009, with an estimated mortality of 281 (SPC-OFP 2010). Interactions with this fishery were observed within the EEZs of Papua New Guinea, Kiribati, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Nauru, and in international waters. Mortality of False Killer Whales has been documented in Chinese purse seine fisheries in the western Pacific (Dai <em>et al</em>. 2017). By contrast, the only mortality documented in the eastern tropical Pacific purse seine fishery since 2001 was in 2010 (IATTC 2011).<br/><br/>Incidental takes of small numbers of False Killer Whales in gill nets have been documented off northern Australia, Sri Lanka, India, Ghana, Brazil, Venezuela, Peru, Japan, Republic of Korea, and China (Perrin <em>et al</em>. 2005, Reeves <em>et al.</em> 2014, Song 2018). Wang <em>et al</em>. (2013) noted that entanglement in large-mesh drift gillnets is likely responsible for most False Killer Whale fishery-related mortality off eastern Taiwan. Yang <em>et al</em>. (1999) reported on cetacean bycatch rates in Chinese coastal fisheries (trawl, gill, and stow nets), which may number in the hundreds per year for False Killer Whales alone.<br/><br/>False Killer Whales have been taken in drive and harpoon fisheries in a number of areas, either for meat or oil, or to reduce populations due to real or perceived fishery conflicts. At least in some areas, the numbers taken have likely reduced local populations. False Killer Whales are occasionally taken at Saint Vincent in the Caribbean for meat and cooking oil (Caldwell and Caldwell 1975). Considerable numbers of False Killer Whales have also been killed in a past drive fishery in the Penghu Islands of Taiwan (Zhou <em>et al</em>. 1995). Official catch records were not recorded until 1972, but from 1958 to 1960, 900 individuals were killed in drive fisheries off northern Kyushu (Kasuya 2017). From 1972 to 2008, 2,643 were reported killed in all fishery types (including bycatch) in Japan, with the highest number in one year of 637 in 1978 (Kasuya 2017). Abundance for coastal Japan was estimated at 2,029 (Kasuya 2017), so this one-year take would have represented approximately 31% of the coastal population as estimated from 1983 to 1991. Over 1,500 were killed in drive fisheries off northern Kyushu between 1972 and 1993, with peak mortality occurring from 1978 to 1983 when 1,358 were reportedly taken (Kasuya 2017). Smaller numbers (171) were killed in a drive fishery at Izu on the east coast of Honshu from 1978 to 1996 with 123 taken in 1978 (Kasuya 2017), and 79 were killed in a crossbow fishery in Okinawa between 1993 and 2011 (Kasuya 2017). False Killer Whales have also been killed in the drive fishery at Taiji on the west coast of Honshu, with 586 killed between 1982 and 2011 and up to 91 killed in a single year (Kasuya 2017). Quotas are in place in Japan for drive and crossbow fisheries although those quotas have only rarely been reached in recent years (Kasuya 2017). Some of the animals caught in the Japanese and Taiwanese drive fisheries have been kept alive and sold to oceanaria (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2003). Deliberate shooting in response to depredation may also occur in a number of areas. Oleson <em>et al</em>. (2010) noted, for example, that in Hawaii fishermen have reported shooting at False Killer Whales or other dolphins in response to depredation. Anderson (2014) noted that False Killer Whales are likely being shot by tuna longline fishermen in the Indian Ocean.<br/><br/>Although there is considerable controversy regarding the absolute extent of declines, there is good evidence of large-scale reductions in many predatory fish populations (e.g., Baum <em>et al</em>. 2003, 2005, Sibert <em>et al</em>. 2006, Polacheck 2006), including Yellowfin and Bigeye Tuna in the western and central Pacific (Harley <em>et al</em>. 2009; Langley <em>et al</em>. 2009). In addition to overfishing, expansion in the extent of unproductive areas and other ecosystem changes (e.g., Polovina <em>et al</em>. 2008, Coll <em>et al</em>. 2008, Koslow <em>et al.</em> 2015) have the potential to influence fish populations at multiple trophic levels. The effects of such reductions of fish populations and subsequent ecosystem changes on populations of False Killer Whales worldwide are unknown but could have resulted in population declines.<br/><br/>Studies of persistent organic pollutants in the main Hawaiian Islands insular population have revealed that all adult males and a number of adult females sampled from the population have levels of PCBs that exceed thresholds thought to cause immunosuppression (Ylitalo <em>et al</em>. 2009, Foltz <em>et al</em>. 2014). Evidence from stranded individuals of several similar species indicates that they have swallowed discarded plastic items, which may eventually lead to death (e.g. Scott <em>et al</em>. 2001); False Killer Whales may also be at risk from this threat.</p><p></p>","<p>Density of False Killer Whales is highest in low latitudes; in the eastern North Pacific, for example, density drops by an order of magnitude north of approximately 15°N (Ferguson and Barlow 2003). Abundance estimates are available for a number of areas, and in general False Killer Whales are among the least abundant delphinids even in their highest density areas (Wade and Gerrodette 1993, Ballance and Pitman 1998). In the eastern tropical Pacific, in an area of 19.1 million km², False Killer Whale abundance was estimated as 38,900 (coefficient of variation (CV) 0.64) based on line-transect surveys from 1986-1991 (Wade and Gerrodette 1993). In the western North Pacific, in an area of 2.9 million km², abundance was estimated as 16,668 (CV 0.26) based on line-transect surveys from 1983-1991 (Miyashita 1993). Kasuya (2017) subdivided this estimate based on region, and noted for coastal Japan (30°-42°N and west of 145°E) the abundance was estimated as 2,029 (95% confidence interval (CI) 907-4,541). In the Gulf of Mexico, there are three False Killer Whale abundance estimates based on line-transect surveys: 381 (CV 0.62) for 1991-1994, 1,038 (CV 0.71) for 1996-2001, and 777 (CV 0.56) for 2003-2004 (Waring <em>et al.</em> 2013). For U.S. waters of the western North Atlantic, abundance was estimated as 442 (CV 1.06) based on a survey in 2011 (Waring <em>et al</em>. 2015). In the western Indian Ocean, the False Killer Whale ranked 11th out of 13 species of delphinids in relative abundance (Ballance and Pitman 1998), based on a line-transect survey in 1995. Abundance off New Zealand was estimated as 111 individuals based on mark-recapture analyses of photo-identification data collected during 2005-2012 (Zaeschmar 2014).<br/><br/>The only region where abundance estimates have been apportioned by stock is within the U.S. EEZ around the Hawaiian Archipelago. The abundance estimate for the main Hawaiian Islands insular stock based on mark-recapture analyses of photo-identified animals was 167 individuals (standard error 23) in 2015 (Bradford <em>et al</em>. 2018). This is the only population where trend information is available, and several lines of evidence suggest that abundance in the 1980s was much higher, likely in the 400-700 range (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2009, Oleson <em>et al</em>. 2010), which would indicate a substantial long-term decline. More recent trend (i.e., 2000s through 2015) is unknown due to the variability associated with recent abundance estimates (Bradford <em>et al</em>. 2018). Abundance of the insular stock in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, in an area of 0.4 million km², was estimated as 552 individuals (CV 1.09) based on a line-transect survey in 2010 (Bradford <em>et al</em>. 2014b). The abundance of the pelagic stock within the entire U.S. EEZ around the Hawaiian Archipelago (an area of 2.3 million km²) was estimated as 1,540 individuals (CV 0.66) based on a 2010 line-transect survey although vessel attraction was not accounted for and this therefore may have led to overestimation of abundance (Bradford <em>et al</em>. 2014b). Although no abundance estimate was given, Anderson (2014) noted that the numbers of False Killer Whales around the Maldives had decreased over a 20-year period and that it may have been due to interactions with longline fisheries in the area.<br/><br/>The generation length for False Killer Whales was estimated at 25 years by Oleson <em>et al</em>. (2010), thus three generations is 75 years. The only subpopulation with sufficient evidence to assess trends over more than one generation is the main Hawaiian Island insular population, where there is evidence of a greater than 50% decline in less than two generations (Oleson <em>et al</em>. 2010).</p>",Unknown,"False Killer Whales are found in tropical to warm temperate zones, generally in relatively deep, offshore waters in all three major oceans. Densities are much higher in tropical regions and movements into higher latitudes may be associated with warmer currents, or they could be seasonal (Zaeschmar 2014). False Killer Whales do not generally range into latitudes higher than 50° in either hemisphere. They are found in many semi-enclosed seas and bays, including the Sea of Japan, Bohai/Yellow Sea, Timor Sea, Arafura Sea, Red Sea, and Persian Gulf, but they are observed only occasionally in the Mediterranean Sea (Notarbartolo di Sciara <em>et al.</em> 2017, Baldwin <em>et al</em> 1999, Leatherwood <em>et al</em>. 1989). There are a few records for the Baltic Sea, which are considered extralimital (Aguayo 1978).","<p>False Killer Whales are taken in hand-harpoon and drive hunts as well as small-type whaling (with a cannon mounted on a vessel below a certain size limit) in Japan (Kishiro and Kasuya 1993, Kasuya 2017). They are also hunted at least opportunistically in Indonesia (Barnes 1991) and the West Indies (Caldwell and Caldwell 1975). Quotas remain for takes of False Killer Whale in drive fisheries and hand-harpoon fisheries in Japan (Kasuya 2017). Although there is no legal hunting of False Killer Whales in the Republic of Korea, meat from False Killer Whales has been represented in markets at significantly higher rates than expected based on reports of bycaught animals (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2006). Based on their analysis, Baker <em>et al</em>. (2006) suggested that the False Killer Whales must be killed at a rate 10-times greater than the reported bycatch.<br/><br/>Some of the animals caught in the drive hunt or bycaught in Japan have been kept alive and sold to oceanaria (Kasuya <em>et al</em>. 1984) and a few were live-captured in California and Hawaii as recently as the 1970s (Reeves and Leatherwood 1984).</p><p></p>",Marine,"<p>The False Killer Whale is listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), and under the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS).<br/><br/>The main Hawaiian Islands insular stock (subpopulation) was listed as endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act in 2012. A number of “biologically important areas” have been recognized for the main Hawaiian Islands insular stock (Baird <em>et al</em>. 2015). Critical habitat for this stock was designated in 2018 as part of a settlement from a lawsuit. Both the Hawaiian pelagic stock and the main Hawaiian Islands insular stock are subjects of a False Killer Whale Take Reduction Plan as required by the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act that went into effect in 2013, in an attempt to reduce bycatch in the Hawaii-based longline fisheries to a level below its calculated potential biological removal. The Take Reduction Plan includes both gear changes (mandating “weak” circle hooks with a maximum wire diameter of 4.5 mm and “strong” branchlines, with a minimum diameter of 2.0 mm) as well as handling guidelines to try to allow hooks to straighten, releasing animals from the gear. In addition, prior to the Take Reduction Plan the longline exclusion area around the main Hawaiian Islands would seasonally contract towards the islands for four months of the year, but the Take Reduction Plan removed that seasonal shift, thus reducing overlap between the longline fishery and the main Hawaiian Islands insular stock. Overall however, as of April 2018, serious injury and mortality rates in the Hawaii-based longline fishery (with the vast majority from the Hawaii pelagic stock of False Killer Whales) had not declined.</p><p></p>",Afrotropical|Australasian|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Oceanian|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
156927622,20733,Stenella longirostris,Least Concern,,2018,2018-02-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Spinner Dolphin is one of the most abundant cetaceans globally (Perrin 2018). The sum of existing abundance estimates is more than one million dolphins, and as these estimates are from only a small fraction of the total distribution range of the species, total abundance is presumably much higher. The Eastern Spinner Dolphin population was listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List in 2012 (<a href=""http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/133712/0"">http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/133712/0</a>); it suffered large mortality in tuna-purse seine fisheries in the past, and is no longer thought to be declining but has shown no clear signs of recovery. Some island-associated populations of Spinner Dolphins are small, insular, and vulnerable to disturbance and other threats. Spinner Dolphins are taken throughout much of their range as bycatch in fisheries and as direct targets of hunting in some areas. There is little quantitative information on bycatch rates in most range states, but it is clear that as well as being one of the most abundant cetaceans, the Spinner Dolphin is one of the more frequently bycaught species. Direct removals are substantial in a few areas, notably the Solomon Islands (average of 214 spinners per year 2000-2002). The species was classified as Data Deficient (DD) on the IUCN Red List in 2008 and it remains data-poor in much of its range. However, given its generally high abundance and pan-tropical distribution, and in the absence of evidence that threats are significant throughout the species’ extensive range, the Spinner Dolphin is assessed as Least Concern. There is not enough information to determine whether the global population has declined by 30% or more over three generations (therefore qualifying for listing as Vulnerable) but this is possible.","<p>Spinner Dolphins occur both on the high seas and in inshore waters associated with islands or banks. In the ETP, they are present in very large numbers many hundreds of kilometers from the nearest land, and they favour a specific habitat type, which oceanographers call ""tropical surface water"" that is typified by a shallow mixed layer, a sharp thermocline, and relatively small annual variation in surface temperature (Perrin and Gilpatrick 1994). They are often found there in close association with Pantropical Spotted Dolphins (<em>Stenella attenuata</em>), Yellowfin Tuna (<em>Thunnus albacares</em>) and birds of several species. School size varies greatly, from just a few to a thousand or more dolphins, and is often larger in pelagic than inshore waters (Perrin 2018). Numerous islands or island groups host small groups of Spinner Dolphins that predictably use shallow, near-shore areas for resting during the day. These include the Hawaiian Islands (Tyne <em>et al.</em> 2015a), Maldives (Ballance and Pitman 2001), and many islands in the South Pacific including Fiji, Tahiti, and Moorea (Oremus <em>et al.</em> 2007).</p>  <p>The dwarf form of the Spinner Dolphin in Southeast Asian waters inhabits shallow coral reef habitat (Perrin and Gilpatrick 1994, Perrin <em>et al.</em> 1999). In the north-central and western Gulf of Mexico, <em>Stenella longirostris</em> is found over intermediate bottom depths (Davis <em>et al</em>. 1998). <br/> <br/> Most Spinner Dolphins feed predominantly at night, on small (&lt;20 cm) mid-water fishes of many different families (including myctophids), squids, and sergestid shrimps (Perrin <em>et al</em>. 1973, Dolar <em>et al</em>. 2003). Dwarf Spinner Dolphins are exceptional, however; they feed (presumably during daylight hours) on small, reef-associated organisms (benthic reef fishes and invertebrates) (Perrin <em>et al</em>. 1999).</p>","<p>Over the period 1960 to 1972, it was estimated that more than 4 million dolphins were killed in the ETP yellowfin tuna purse-seine fishery (Wade <em>et al.</em> 2007). The main species killed were the Pantropical Spotted Dolphin (<em>Stenella attenuata</em>) and the Spinner Dolphin, both of which associate with tuna in that area. Fishermen use the dolphins to locate schools of tuna, and often purposely chase and encircle them in the nets; this maximizes the catch of tuna but can also result in entanglement and mortality of the dolphins (Gerrodette 2018). Mortality in the tuna fishery was estimated to have reduced the population of Eastern Spinners by 65% (Wade <em>et al.</em> 2007, Reilly <em>et al</em>. 2005). Since the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) implemented per-vessel mortality limits on the international fleet, the reported mortality of Eastern and White-bellied Spinners, combined, decreased dramatically to only a few hundred individuals (IATTC 2006). Despite this reduction in mortality, the eastern subspecies appears to be recovering slowly at best. Factors such as fishery-related stress, unobserved mortality due to calf separation and orphaning during fishing operations (Archer <em>et al</em>. 2001), mortality caused by small vessels that do not carry observers, and under-reporting of mortality have been suggested as possible reasons for the Eastern Spinner’s slow recovery (Gerrodette and Forcada 2005). <br/> <br/> Throughout much of their range, Spinner Dolphins are taken as bycatch in purse-seine, gillnet, and trawl fisheries (Perrin <em>et al</em>. 1994, Donahue and Edwards 1996), often in high numbers. Spinner Dolphins are the most abundant dolphins in the Indian Ocean (Ballance and Pitman 1998) and are taken throughout that region in numbers that are largely unknown but may be substantial, especially as there is evidence that dolphins associate with tuna in this region (Anderson 2014). Annual bycatch levels of hundreds of Spinner Dolphins were reported in the few fisheries examined in India in the 1980s and early 1990s (Mohan 1994), and annual takes in the thousands were reported in Sri Lanka in the 1980s (Leatherwood and Reeves 1989). They were reported to be the most frequently bycaught cetaceans in the Union of the Comoros (Kiszka <em>et al.</em> 2008), and amongst the most commonly taken in Madagascar (Razafindrakoto <em>et al</em>. 2004), Mayotte, and other countries in the western Indian Ocean (Kiszka <em>et al.</em> 2008). Unknown numbers have been taken in the tuna purse-seine fishery in the eastern Atlantic (Donahue and Edwards 1996) and in small-scale gillnet fisheries in the western Atlantic (Siciliano 1994). They have been reported as bycatch in the Caribbean Sea (Vidal <em>et al.</em> 1994). <br/></p>  <p>Dwarf Spinners are caught incidentally in shrimp trawls in the Gulf of Thailand (Perrin <em>et al</em>. 1999). Zerbini and Kotas (1998) reported on by-catches in Brazilian drift-net fisheries and Cockcroft (1990) on animals entangled in shark nets off KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. There are likely to be undocumented interactions with fisheries off West Africa (Weir 2010, Jefferson <em>et al.</em> 1997).<br/> </p>  <p>In some areas, human use of bycaught cetaceans has led to directed hunting or deliberate gillnetting of Spinner Dolphins. For example, this has been reported in Sri Lanka (Leatherwood and Reeves 1989), the Philippines (Dolar 1994), and Indonesia (Kahn 2004). However. it is unclear whether, or how extensively, this activity continues in all of these places. Spinners may also be taken intentionally in West Africa (Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 1999). Drive hunting of Spinner Dolphins takes place in Anakao, Madagascar (Cerchio <em>et al</em>. 2011) and in the Solomon Islands (Oremus <em>et al. </em>2015). <br/></p>  <p>The habit of resting in shallow coastal waters during the day leads to problems of disturbance by dolphin-watching boats and swimmers in many areas.</p>","<p>The Spinner Dolphin is the most common small cetacean in tropical pelagic waters (Perrin 2018). It was considered the most abundant cetacean species in the Indian Ocean (Ballance and Pitman 1998) and the Red Sea (Notarbartolo <em>et al</em>. 2017), and it was by far the most common cetacean encountered, and also had the largest mean school size, in the Maldives (Ballance <em>et al.</em> 2001), Tanzania (Braulik <em>et al</em>. 2018), and Pakistan (Gore <em>et al.</em> 2012). There were an estimated 801,000 (coefficient of variation (CV)=37%) White-bellied Spinners (<em>S. l. orientalis</em> – <em>S. l. longirostris</em> intergrades) in the ETP in 2000 (Gerrodette <em>et al</em>. 2005). The Eastern Spinner, which is the dolphin most heavily affected by the ETP tuna fishery, numbered about 613,000 (CV=22%) in 2003 (Gerrodette and Forcada 2005). Despite large reductions in bycatch mortality since the 1970s, this population appeared to be recovering at an estimated rate of only 1.1% per year during the early 2000s, an estimate that was not statistically different from zero (Gerrodette and Forcada 2005). Estimated abundance in the southern part of the Sulu Sea and northeastern Malaysian waters was 4,000 (Dolar <em>et al</em>. 1997), and in the southeastern Sulu Sea, about 31,000 (CV=27%) (Dolar <em>et al</em>. 2006). In Egyptian waters of the southern Red Sea, line-transect surveys in 2010, 2011, and 2012 generated an estimate of 6,961 (CV=0.26) Spinner Dolphins (Costa 2015). Although survey effort has been limited, the small number of records suggests that Spinner Dolphins are present but less abundant in the Atlantic (Weir 2010, Carretta <em>et al.</em> 2017) than in the Indian or Pacific Oceans.</p>  <p>Island-associated populations of Spinner Dolphins are often genetically distinct and inhabit relatively small areas. For example, the Hawaii Island (‘Big Island’) stock was estimated as 631 (95% confidence interval (CI) 524–761) from surveys conducted between September 2010 and August 2011 (Tyne <em>et al.</em> 2015a), and a population of Spinners on the leeward coast of Kauai Island was estimated as 601 (CV = 0.20) for the period October to November 2005 (Carretta <em>et al.</em> 2017). Abundance of Spinner Dolphins on the southwest coast of Mauritius was estimated using photo-identification data collected between April 2008 and June 2010, as ranging between 138 and 399 individuals (Webster <em>et al.</em> 2015). At the South Pacific island of Moorea, Spinner Dolphin abundance in 2002 was estimated using mark-recapture as 135 (95% CI 112-163) (Oremus <em>et al.</em> 2007).</p>  There is no global abundance estimate for this widely distributed species. The abundance estimates listed above add up to more than a million dolphins. However, the vast majority of the species range remains unsurveyed, therefore the actual abundance is presumed to be considerably greater.",Unknown,"Spinner Dolphins occur throughout tropical and subtropical waters in both hemispheres from approximately 40°N to 40°S. They inhabit the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans, including the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea, however they do not occur in the Mediterranean Sea. <br/> <br/> <em>Stenella longirostris longirostris</em> is the most common and widely distributed subspecies. It occurs mainly around oceanic islands and near coastlines in the tropical Atlantic and Indian Oceans and in the central and western Pacific (Rice 1998). Distribution in many parts of East and West Africa as well as in South America is poorly known.<br/> <br/> <em>Stenella longirostris orientalis</em> inhabits pelagic waters of the eastern tropical Pacific (ETP) east of about 145°W, from 24°N off Baja California (Mexico) to 10°S off Peru, but exclusive of the range of <em>S. l. centroamericana</em> (Perrin 1990). <br/> <br/> <em>Stenella longirostris centroamericana</em> is found in coastal waters over the continental shelf of the ETP, from the Gulf of Tehuantepec in southern Mexico, southeastward to Costa Rica (Perrin 1990). <br/> <br/> <em>Stenella longirostris roseiventris</em> is distributed in shallow waters of inner Southeast Asia, including the Gulf of Thailand, the Timor and Arafura Seas off northern Australia, and other similar areas off Indonesia and Malaysia. It is replaced in deeper waters by the larger pelagic subspecies <em>S. l. longirostris</em> (Perrin <em>et al</em>. 1999).","<p>As one of the most common cetaceans in many tropical oceanic regions, the Spinner Dolphin is also often one of the species bycaught in fishing gear. In many places, accidentally captured dolphins are eaten or used as bait in shark fisheries and in some instances this accidental taking has led to directed, targeted taking as well (Dolar <em>et al.</em> 1994, Leatherwood and Reeves 1989, Robards and Reeves 2009, Kiszka 2012). ‘Incidentally’ captured Spinner Dolphins are reportedly eaten in Madagascar (Razafindrakoto <em>et al</em>. 2004), Tanzania (Amir <em>et al</em>. 2002), India (Kumarran 2012), the Grenadines in the Caribbean (where they are also hunted), Brazil, Venezuela, Indonesia, the Philippines (Robards and Reeves 2009) and much of West Africa (Weir 2010, Alfaro-Shigueto and Van Waerebeek 2001). Dolphin meat, including Spinner Dolphin meat, is sometimes used as bait for sharks in at least Tanzania, the Philippines, and Venezuela (Amir <em>et al. </em>2002, Dolar <em>et al</em>. 1994, Perrin and Gilpatrick 1994). They are hunted in the Solomon Islands, mainly for teeth used in a traditional economy (Oremus <em>et al.</em> 2015). <br/></p>  <p>Non-consumptive uses of Spinner Dolphins include dolphin-watching tourism. Because of their gregarious nature and acrobatic behaviour, Spinner Dolphins are targeted for both boat-based and swim-with-the-dolphins tourism in many places, including Hawaii, Egypt, and French Polynesia (Gannier and Petiau 2006, Tyne <em>et al.</em> 2017, Notarbartolo <em>et al.</em> 2007). Harassment by dolphin-watching boats is emerging as a new source of disturbance to Spinner Dolphins at several localities in Oceania and Southeast Asia (Tyne <em>et al</em>. 2015b, 2017). In west Hawaii, abundance estimates from 2011 and 2012 were lower than all previous years, indicating a possible long-term impact of dolphin-centred tourism on local population size (Tyne <em>et al</em>. 2017).</p>",Marine,"<p>The Spinner Dolphin is listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.<br/> <br/> The taking of Spinner Dolphins and other cetaceans affected by the ETP tuna purse-seine fishery is managed both nationally by the coastal countries and internationally by the IATTC. The IATTC has imposed annual stock mortality limits on each purse seine fleet and promulgated regulations regarding the safe release of dolphins (Gosliner 1999, Bayliff 2001). <br/> <br/> In several locations where Spinner Dolphins are the target of dolphin tourism, including Samadai Reef in Egypt and the Hawaiian Islands, local authorities have implemented management measures to control the number of visitors and boats, and thus to limit the impacts on dolphins (Notarbartolo <em>et al.</em> 2009, Tyne <em>et al.</em> 2015b). </p>  <p>The species is composed of several subspecies and numerous regional populations, each of which could be assessed separately for the IUCN Red List. The eastern spinner dolphin (<em>Stenella longirostris orientalis</em>) is currently listed as Vulnerable (http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/133712/0).

They used to pose a problem to barley growing near the mountains in Gyeonsangnam Province and have girdled half the peach trees that were growing on a five hectare farm in Jeollanam Province (Flux and Angermann 1990). Due to low density, recent damages on agriculture have been rarely reported (Jo 2018) A study conducted in Mt. Chirisan National Park, South Korea, indicated that Korean Hare abundance was positively associated with the percent of shrub cover within a given landscape (Rhim and Lee 2007). Huang <em>et al.</em> (2014) and Son <em>et al.</em> (2017) determined that hare abundance was greater in habitat conditions with significant cover and understory in larch forests. Their density can be greater in Japanese larch plantations compared with natural deciduous forest. Populations are negatively impacted when percent edge increased, which is an indicator of higher levels of fragmentation (Lee and Rhim 2017).

Their low density is believed to be a result of interspecific predation and the resulting habitat specialisation leading to a small percentage of the landscape being suitable for their needs. Due to their general low density and patchy distribution, relatively large areas are required to conserve viable populations (Ross et al. 2019a). Pallas’s Cats are also highly dependent on cavities to provide dens for daily use and rearing young, which further restricts habitat availability (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2010a).</p><p>Predation by sympatric carnivores, herding dogs, and human offtake are the main known causes of mortality, but habitat disturbance and fragmentation is believed to be their main threat (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019b). Mineral exploitation and infrastructure developments have increased throughout the species range. Pallas’s Cat also continues to be at risk from a declining prey base due to pika (<em>Ochotona</em> spp.) and rodent control programmes leading to prey depletion and secondary poisoning (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019b).</p><p>Due to the difficulty of observing the species, data generally consist of individual records, and there are no current monitoring programmes that would allow empirical estimates of population size or population trend. However, recent reviews have highlighted that the global population size is unlikely to be low enough to qualify as Near Threatened (Barashkova<em> et al. </em>2019). In addition, we used the methods of Santini <em>et al. </em>(2019) to quantify habitat loss and disturbance across Pallas’s Cats range between 1994 and 2015 (or three generations). The analyses indicated that between these years the change in suitable habitat and level of habitat fragmentation was low, suggesting suitable habitat is likely to be disappearing at a lower rate than previously assumed, and indicating the population may be more stable than thought. Though caution is needed as information on the Pallas’s Cat is incomplete, and threats may be acting at a different scale than our analyses. We also have no information describing the species population dynamics and how the population may track prey availability. Nevertheless, based on distributional data, the Pallas’s Cat population as a whole appears more stable than previously thought leading to its inclusion in the Least Concern category.</p><p>  </p><p>  </p><p>  </p>","<p></p><p>Pallas's Cat is distributed in landscapes with extreme continental climates - little rainfall, low humidity, and a wide range of temperatures. They are rarely found in areas where there is persistent snow cover of depths over 10 cm, and a continuous snow cover of 15–20 cm is thought to mark the ecological limit for this species (Heptner and Sludskii 1972, Kirilyuk and Puzanski 2000, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). They are generally associated with montane grassland steppe and shrub steppe, but are habitat specialists, selecting habitats providing hiding cover such as ravines, rocky areas, and disruptive vegetation cover that allow them to move through the landscape without being detected by predators (Ross 2009, Ross <em>et al. </em>2012). Their optimal habitat consists of a mix of grassland and shrub steppe with rocky cover, ravines, and hill-slopes. They are rarely found in lowland basins or flat featureless plains, although may access these areas through ravines or other disruptive cover, to access prey or in transit to better habitat (Ross 2009, Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2019, Ross <em>et al. </em>2019b).</p><p>A recent review discussed the general habitat features of Pallas’s Cats’ in Central Asia (Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019), Western Asia (Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019), and the Himalaya and China (Dhendup <em>et al. </em>2019). Central Asian habitats were characterised by hills, rocky outcrops, scree slopes, ravines, and rock cover, with petrophytic dry steppe or semi-desert vegetation (Heptner and Sludskii 1972; Sludskii 1982; Kirilyuk and Puzansky 2000; Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010a, b, 2012; Istomov <em>et al.</em> 2016; Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2019).</p><p>In Western Asia, a single record in the Iranian Caucasus suggests Pallas’s Cat uses open, hilly steppes and shrubland, with rocky outcrops and scattered trees (Aghili<em> et al. </em>2008). In Iran, the Pallas’s Cat occurs across a wide continuum of habitats, from arid grass­land steppes and dry mountains to temperate open shrublands. In Afghanistan, habitat consists of arid plateaus with flat and rolling mountains interspersed by rocky and deep valleys. In Pakistan, the species prefers alpine and sub­alpine scrub, dominated by rugged and broken terrain with high cliffs, ridges and ravines. In Turkmenistan, the species is predominantly associated with mountains and foothills (Heptner and Sludskii 1972, Rustamov and Hojamyradov 1994, Chalani <em>et al.</em> 2008, Joolaee<em> et al. </em>2014, Farhadinia et al. 2016, Talebi Otaghvar<em> et al. </em>2017, Adibi<em> et al. </em>2018, Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019). In Turkmenistan, the species is historically considered rare (Shukurov 1962) and predominantly associated with mountains and foothills of the Kopet Dag and the Big Balkan range (A. Potaeva and T. Rosen, pers. comm. 2019, Shukurov 1962). Pallas’s Cat has also been found in juniper woodland (<em>Juniperus </em>spp.) in Pakistan and Iran (Hameed <em>et al.</em> 2014, Dibadj <em>et al.</em> 2018). In Western Asia, the median elevation of Pallas’s Cat records is 2,372 m (range: 894–3,665 m), which corresponds to a mid-mountain elevation (Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019).</p><p>There are fewer records or accounts of Pallas’s Cat habitat in the Himalaya and China region, meaning we are unable to assess the importance of different habitat types. However, habitats of the region are generally of higher elevation with some of the highest elevation records found for the species (Fox and Dorji 2007, Chanchani 2008, Werhahn <em>et al. </em>2018, Dhendup <em>et al.</em> 2019, Pal <em>et al.</em> 2019). In Bhutan, with its warmer south-facing Himalayan slopes, Pallas’s Cat is found in rolling hills dominated by glacial out-wash and alpine steppe vegetation (<a name=""_Hlk10972711"">WWF 2012</a>, Thinley 2013). Pallas’s Cat occurs in Nepal in upper Manang valley within broken and rocky habitats, rolling hill slopes with few cliffs, and in Dolpo in rocky hill slopes within montane grassland steppe (Shrestha <em>et al.</em> 2014, Lama <em>et al.</em> 2016, Regmi <em>et al.</em> 2016). In India, the majority of records are from the Trans-Himalayan landscapes of Ladakh and Sikkim (Prater and Barruel 1971, Mallon 1991, Mahar <em>et al.</em> 2017, Pal <em>et al.</em> 2019). In the Tibetan region Pallas’s Cat has been reported in desert steppe habitat at 5,050 m dominated by <em>Stipa</em> spp. (Fox and Dorji 2007) and in mountainous alpine meadows in Qinghai (Li <em>et al. </em>2013) and Mountain steppe in Sichuan (Webb<em> et al.</em> 2014, 2016).</p><p>The observed large-scale habitat associations of Pallas’s Cat, which all contain some form of disruptive or hiding cover, can be explained by Pallas’s Cat being under constant risk of predation by sympatric aerial and terrestrial carnivores (Ross 2009). We have evidence of predation by numerous large raptors, and carnivores such as the grey wolf (<em>Canis lupus</em>), herding dogs, and red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), they are also hunted by humans (Ross 2009, Barashkova and Smelansky 2011; Ross <em>et al.</em> 2012, 2019b), other large carnivores, such as snow leopard, may also opportunistically predate Pallas’s Cat where they co-exist. The Pallas’s Cat is not a fast runner and when threatened by other predators its best line of defence is hiding out of sight, relying on their excellent camouflage and taking cover in burrows (of marmots or sympatric carnivores) or in rock crevices. In general, open areas without suitable cover are avoided and habitats with disruptive cover such as ravines, rocky areas, shrub-steppe, and hill-slopes are highly selected (Ross 2009, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010a). As a result, Pallas’s Cat uses only a small fraction of habitats available within the steppe ecosystem. Their habitat selection and specialisation is the most likely explanation for their low densities (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2016, 2019a), and should be accounted for in expert knowledge-based estimates of their potential population size.</p><p>Pallas’s Cat also has a dependency on refuges or dens. Dens are used on a daily basis to provide important cover from predators, for feeding, mating, giving birth, raising young, and for thermoregulation during the extremely cold winters (Ross <em>et al</em>. 2010a). Den availability is thought to be critical for survival, and a critical habitat requirement for their conservation (Ross 2009, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010a). Dens mostly consist of marmot burrows and rock crevices (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010a), in Southern Siberia and Kazakhstan the den sites of sympatric carnivores are more commonly used (Ross<em> et al</em>. 2019b), and in Iran Pallas’s Cat has been observed using aged Juniperus excelsa tree cavities as breeding dens (Dibadj <em>et al. </em>2018). Despite the range of habitats used by the species, the presence of suitable cavities appears to be a standard niche requirement (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019a).</p><p>The annual home ranges of Pallas’s Cat are unusually large for a small felid. Researchers in Mongolia</p><p>have measured mean annual home ranges as follows (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2012):</p><p>Female = 95% kernels 23.1 +/- 8.9 km²; 100% MCP = 64.1+/-18.6 km²; n = 13</p><p>Male = 95% kernels 98.8 +/- 17.2 km², 100% MCP = 159.0 +/- 59.3 km²; n = 9</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Radio-tracking studies of Pallas’s Cat in the Daursky State Nature Reserve (Zabaikalsky Krai, Russia)</p><p>calculated the following ranges (Barashkova and Kirilyuk 2011):</p><p>Female = 95% kernels 6.0 +/- 3.4 km²; 100% MCP = 10.0 +/- 6.5 km²; n = 4 </p><p>Male = 95% kernels 22.9 +/- 12.9 km²; 100% MCPs = 16.5 +/- 9.4 km²; n = 3</p><p>Pallas’s Cat diet is mainly composed of small lagomorphs and rodents, it is known to be a pika (Ochotona spp.) specialist (Ross et al. 2010b). Pikas are the most important prey across its range, typically comprising over 50% of the diet and highly selected over other prey species (Heptner and Sludskii 1972, Ross et al. 2010b). As pikas are 2–4 times larger than other common small mammal prey, Pallas’s Cat preference for them optimises hunting efficiency and energy intake. They also consume gerbils, jirds, voles, hamsters and ground squirrels; less frequently consumed prey includes small birds, young marmots, hares, hedgehogs, reptiles, and invertebrates (Kirilyuk 1999, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010b, Adibi <em>et al.</em> 2018, Werhahn <em>et al. </em>2018, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019, Moqanaki<em> et al.</em> 2019). Pallas’s Cats has also been recorded eating berries (Kirilyuk 1999) and scavenging from carcasses (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010b, 2019b).</p><p>                                                In an assessment of Pallas’s Cat habitat loss and fragmentation at a global scale, E.M. <span class=""A8"">Moqanaki, (unpublished analyses) used the methods of Santini <em>et al.</em> (2019) to quantify habitat loss and disturbance across Pallas’s Cats range (AOO) between 1994 and 2015 (or three generations). The analyses indicated that between these years the change in extent of suitable habitat within EOO (represented by ESA (2015)’s CCI land cover categories 120, 121, 122, 130, 140, 150, 200, 201, 202) and level of habitat fragmentation was very low (below 5%). As previous assessments have used estimates of habitat loss as justification to infer a declining Pallas’s Cat population, the analyses suggests the population is likely to be more stable than previously thought. A more detailed analyses, of habitat loss across the species range, that includes more variables and simulation, is recommended to provide a better indicator of Pallas’s Cat and other steppe species likely status.</p><span class=""A8""><p></p></span>","<p>Pallas’s Cat has several known and tested biological causes of vulnerability, including feeding and habitat specialisation, large home range sizes, making them difficult to protect within reserves, and a dependency on shelters made by other threatened species, such as Siberian marmots Marmota sibirica (Ross 2009, 2010 a,b, 2012).</p>  <p>In most regions, the specialist requirements of the Pallas’s Cat result in its distribution being naturally fragmented, due to resources and habitat patches being se­parated by large areas of poor habitat with insufficient prey or cover from predation (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2016, 2019b). As Pallas’s Cat is predated by sympatric carnivores it has a need for safe refuges, and so has a dependency on marmot burrows and rock cavities, particularly for raising young (Ross <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2010a). Most marmot species remain non-threatened but the Siberian Marmot, which overlaps Pallas’s Cat’s range in Russia and Mongolia, has declined due to overharvesting and is now classified as Endangered (Clayton 2016). The decline in marmots may result in the loss burrow habitat which is regarded as a keystone resource for Pallas’s Cat in many regions of grassland steppe across its range (Ross <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2010a).</p>  <p>The most serious threat to Pallas’s Cat across its range is habitat degradation and frag­mentation that are largely consequences of increasing livestock numbers, conversion of steppe grasslands into arable land, infrastruc­ture development and resource extraction. Mineral exploitation and infrastructural developments have also increased substantially across the range with increased frag­mentation as a result (Awehali 2011, Paltsyn <em>et al. </em>2012, Selles 2013; Ross <em>et al. </em>2016, 2019a). Due to degradation and loss of habitat, Pallas’s Cat populations are becoming increasingly fragmented, and isolated subpopulations are very likely disappearing without our knowledge (<a name=""_Hlk10872039"">Ross <em>et al. </em>2019</a>a). In Mongolia, for example, livestock numbers have increased from 26 million in 1991 to 66 million in 2018 (FAO 1998, National Statistical Office of Mongolia 2018). Increasing livestock numbers result in heavy grazing and habitat degradation, but also in displacement of Pallas’s Cats and increasing number of herding dogs which are known to kill the species (Ross 2009, Barashkova and Smelansky 2011, Ross <em>et al. </em>2012, Joolaee <em>et al.</em> 2014, Farhadinia <em>et al.</em> 2016, Ruta 2018). In Kazakhstan there is also a threat from farming, as large areas of secondary steppe grassland are being converted into arable pastures endangering local Pallas’s Cat subpopulations by increasing isolation and fragmentation of habitat (<a>A. Barashkova pers. comm. 2019).</a></p>  <p>Predation by herding dogs, feral dogs, acci­dental capture when trapping or snaring other animals, and illegal and legal hunting are the main recorded causes of direct anthropogenic mortality of Pallas’s Cats (Ross 2009, Barashkova and Smelansky 2011, Farhadinia <em>et al</em><em>.&#160;</em>2016, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2016, Ruta 2018, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019).</p>  <p>New emerging threats are also of con­cern. Climate change for example is predicted to have large impacts on the grasslands and mountain ecosystems of Central Asia and the Himalayas (Angerer <em>et al. </em>2008, Xu <em>et al. </em>2009). The potential impacts of climate change on Pallas’s Cats are unknown, but evidence sug­gests recent changes of the grassland and mountain ecosystems of Central Asia and Himalayas are at least in part related to cli­mate change (Angerer <em>et al.</em> 2008, Xu<em> et al.</em> 2009). Climate change is also predicted to have large impacts on steppe and mountain ecosystems in the future with a cascade of changes to the ecosystem likely to follow (IPCC 2014). As Pallas’s Cat is a strict seasonal breeder, female ovulation and male sperm production are both regulated by day length and peak during the late winter breeding season (Brown <em>et al. </em>2002). Con­sidering that the breeding season is dictated by day length, as opposed to climate, Pallas’s Cats may be unable to respond to seasonal changes in ecological parameters that result from climate change. As indicated by large gains in body mass, Pallas’s Cats build-up en­ergy reserves during the summer when prey is abundant (Ross 2009, Naidenko<em> et al. </em>2014), and invest these reserves in reproduction during the late winter when prey availability is low (Ross <em>et al. </em>2010a). As climate change alters seasonal patterns, and with it prey availability, this is likely to affect Pallas’s Cats’ ability to balance energy reserves (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019a).</p>  The poisoning of small mammals, such as pikas and Brandt’s vole Lasiopodomys brandtii, is still occurring in the steppe ecosystem, with an aim of reducing disease transmission from small mammals to humans and livestock and improving range­land quality for livestock (Smith <em>et al. </em>2008). Although information is scarce, poisoning continues in China where pika populations can be reduced by 95% (Lai and Smith 2003, Ba­dingqiuying <em>et al. </em>2016). In the Qinghai-Tibe­tan Plateau, for example, between 2006 and 2013 approximately $25.5 million was spent to eradicate the plateau pika (<em>O. curzoniae</em>) from over 78,500 km2 in Sanjiangyuan National Nature Reserve alone (Wilson and Smith 2015). Research has also shown carnivore populations may suffer declines as a consequence of poisoning campaigns (Badingqiuying <em>et al.</em> 2016). In Mongolia, campaigns to control small mammal numbers have occurred in all provinces (Clark <em>et al.</em> 2006, Winters 2006, Ross <em>et al. </em>2016) but there is no informa­tion on its current prevalence. In Russia and Kazakhstan poisoning occurs at a local scale to control local disease outbreaks (Barashkova et al. 2019). Although the occurrence of poisoning has very likely decreased over the last decade, where the practice continues there is little doubt that aerial and terrestrial carnivores will suffer multiple consequences, such as secondary poisoning and prey depletion (Ross <em>et al. </em>2019a).<p></p>","<p>As Pallas’s Cat has a wide yet fragmented distribution across the grasslands and montane steppes of Central and Western Asia, we assume the global population is fragmented into many sub-populations. Due to the difficulty of reliably and repeatedly detecting Pallas’s Cat by any survey protocol, the differentiation of sub-populations and the estimate of population size remains extremely difficult. Nevertheless, several estimates of population density have been made, using several methods. In central Mongolia, an estimate of 4–8 cats/100 km² was made based upon radio telemetry of 28 cats, weekly spotlight surveys, and observations while radiotracking over a period of 2 years, giving confidence that most individuals were observed (Ross 2009). Several population estimates have been made in Russia, based on snow tracking and correction formulas. Snow tracking studies in Russia have suggested that the Pallas’s Cat can periodically occur at very high densities up to 100 cats/100 km² in areas of Dauria (Kirilyuk and Barashkova 2011, Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2017). Confirming the high densities, Naidenko <em>et al.</em> (2014) captured a total of 16 Pallas’s Cats in an area of 16 km², equating to an apparent density of 100 cats/100 km² in Dauria. Though the high density is very likely to be a localised phenomenon, possibly related to prey eruptions. However, given the lack of repeated occurrences of the Pallas’s Cat in many areas across its range, it seems low density (4 cats/100 km²&#160;) is a more applicable average density for the species.&#160;&#160;</p>  In a recent review of Pallas’s Cat in Russia and Central Asia, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> (2019) estimated the potential population size in this region as approximately 49,000–98,000. Though they added the estimate is highly speculative. The estimate also assumed the entire predicted suitable habitat is currently occupied. Based on our understanding of the AOO (based on predictive models of Pallas's Cat occupancy), we estimate the global population of mature Pallas's Cats at approximately 58,000. This is based on the assumption that within the AOO Pallas's Cat has an average density of 4 cats/100 km², and that 20% of the population are immature non-breeders.&#160; Despite the speculative nature of these estimates, they indicate that the population size of Pallas’s Cat almost certainly exceeds the limits specified under the Near Threatened classification.<p></p>",Decreasing,"<p>  </p><p>The Pallas’s Cat primarily occurs within regions of montane grassland and shrubland steppe of Central Asia, but is found as far west as Western Iran and previously extended into Armenia and Azerbaijan (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2016). The core populations of Pallas’s Cat are believed to occur in Mongolia and China (Smith <em>et al.</em>&#160;2008, Jutzeler et al. 2010). In Russia, the Pallas’s Cat occurs along the border with Mongolia and China mainly in the Altai, Tyva, and Buryatia Republics (Altai and Sayan Mountains), and Trans-Baikal Territory (Koshkarev 1998, Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2007). They are found in mountain steppe and semi desert foothills in Central and eastern Kazakhstan (Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019), and some areas of Kyrgyzstan (Snow Leopard Trust 2014, Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2019). In Uzbekistan and Tajikistan the species was recorded before the 1960s but not more recently (Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2019).</p><p>Outside Iran, records of Pallas’s Cat in the southwest of its range (also vaguely known as the Caspian Sea range; Southern Caucuses, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan) are rare and thus the conservation status of the species there is unknown (Habibi 2004, Hameed<em> </em><em>et al.</em> 2014<a name=""_Hlk12187509"">, Farhadinia <em>et al. </em>2016</a>, Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019). Iran appears to have the widest geographic distribution of the Pallas’s Cat in this region, where most of the recent occurrence records are associated with the two main mountain chains of Alborz and Zagros in the north and west, respectively (Karami <em>et al.</em> 2016, Moqanaki <em>et al. </em>2019, Yusefi <em>et al.</em> 2019). In Afghanistan, multiple occurrences have been recently collected from Bamyan Province during camera trap surveys for the Persian leopard (<em>Panthera pardus</em>; WCS 2017). Recent occurrence records from Pakistan are restricted to Gilgit-Baltistan, and there is evidence they inhabit the border area with Afghanistan (<a name=""_Hlk12187460"">Hameed <em>et al.</em> 2014, </a>Hussain 2018). The latest Pallas’s Cat records from Turkmenistan are from Dushak Erekdag in the Kopet Dag, the Turkmen-Khorasan Mountain Range in the borderland with north-eastern Iran (A. Potaeva and T. Rosen, pers. comm. 2019). The species presence in Pakistan’s Baluchistan Province, as well as Armenia and Azerbaijan in the Caucasus, is uncertain (Moqanaki<em> et al</em>. 2019).</p><p>        Recent records from Bhutan, Nepal, and India also suggest Pallas’s Cat presence in the Eastern Himalayan region but at a low density (WWF 2012, Thinley 2013, Shrestha <em>et al.</em> 2014, Mahar<em> et al</em>. 2017, Dhendup <em>et al</em>. 2019, <a name=""_Hlk12187607"">Pal <em>et al</em>. 2019</a>). The highest elevation record for Pallas’s Cat, of 5,593 m, was found in the Himalayan region in Nepal (Werhahn <em>et al</em>. 2018).</p><p>  </p>","<p>The extent of illegal hunting and illegal trade of Pallas’s Cats or their body parts is unknown (Barclay <em>et al.</em> 2019, Ross <em>et al. </em>2019a). It has been reported that international trade in Pallas’s Cat pelts ceased since the late 1980s, and Mongolia is the only range country where hunting of Pallas’s Cat is per­mitted today, although they can be hunted in China if a special license is obtained (Lu <em>et al. </em>2010, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2016, Barclay <em>et al.</em> 2019). The permitting system in Mongolia is said to be ineffective and Pallas’s Cat furs were exported illegally to China (Murdoch <em>et al. </em>2006). It has been estimated that there were about 1,000 legal Pallas’s Cat hunters in Mongolia with a mean harvest rate of 2 Pallas’s Cats per hunter per year (Wingard and Zahler 2006). It is difficult to estimate levels of illegal hunting, though it is likely much higher than the legal level of hunting and is known to happen across all range countries. Evidence of illegal trade in Pallas’s Cat is reported from Afghanistan and Pakistan (e.g. Kretser <em>et al. </em>2012), but it seems to be only occasional and opportunistic, though this may reflect the rarity of Pallas’s Cat. Marmots are commonly hunted in most of the Pallas’s Cats range and Pallas’s Cats are often mistaken for marmots and shot (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2019b). They are also trapped incidentally in leg-hold traps and snares set for other animals (Ross 2009). The fat and organs of Pallas’s Cats are used as medicine in Mongolia and Russia (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2016, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019). A report from Kyrgyzstan suggests that Pallas’s Cat is often harvested in winter by tracking them back to their den and capturing them using snares (T. Rosen pers. comm. 2020). Undoubtably more information on illegal offtake of Pallas’s Cat is needed, as hunting could be a more significant threat than we currently assume, certainly at a local level but possibly also range wide.</p>",Terrestrial,"<p><span class=""A9"">In 2019 a conservation action plan was written to move towards promoting the survival of Pallas’s Cat across its historic range. The action plan has a number of conservation actions including increasing conservation research, education and awareness, decreasing human caused mortality and coordinating conservation efforts. These actions will be implemented over the next 10 years (<span class=""A15"">Pallas's Cat Global Action Planning Group 2019), and consequently, conservation action is expected to increase in the near future.</span></p>  <p>In situ conservation of the species occurs mainly through prohibi­tion or regulation of hunting and trade, and habitat conservation within protected areas (Barashkova et al. 2019; Pallas’s Cat is listed under CITES Appendix II as <em>Felis manul</em>). Hunting of this species is prohibited in most current range countries except Mongolia (Nowell and Jackson 1996), which restricts hunting and regulates trade through a permitting system. Trophy hunters can purchase limited hunting licenses in Mongolia and export trophies (Clark <em>et al</em><em>. </em>2006).</p>  <p>Using predictive modelling across Central Asia, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> (2019) estimated that suitable Pallas’s Cat habitats cover 170 protected areas of Russia, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan; although confirmation of the species has only been documented in 36 of the protected areas. In Russia, the Tyvan and Daurian State Nature Reserves remain the most important protected areas for Pallas’s Cat conservation, the recently created federal refuge in Dzeren's Valley (subordinated to Daursky reserve) is also occupied by Pallas’s Cat's ( Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019). Although research is ongoing in Western Asia and the Himalaya, conservation actions are currently limited (<span class=""A8"">Moqanaki<em> et al. </em>2019, Dhendup <em>et al</em>. 2019). A preliminary assessment of the potential distribution of the Pallas’s Cat in Western Asia predicted vast climatic suitability across mid-elevation areas in this region, yet dispersal barriers and biotic interactions (e.g. predator-prey relationships) may have restricted the currently occupied habitat (Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019). The same is true of China, but Pallas’s Cat has been reported in several protected areas including: Xuelingyunshan, Tuomuerfeng, Luoshan, Baijitan, Qinghaihuniaodao, Wanglang, Wolong, Zhumulangmafeng, Kalamailishan, Qitaihuangmobanhuangmo, Aerjinshan, Ganjiahu (Xinjiang), Luobupoyeluotuo (CSIS 2008).

166598553,18255,Piliocolobus oustaleti,Vulnerable,A4cd,2020,2018-03-22 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<a name=""_GoBack""></a><em>Piliocolobus oustaleti</em> is listed as Vulnerable, despite having a large geographic range, as this genetically, morphologically and ecologically variable taxon has declined over the past decade or more, and the decline is expected to accelerate in the future. Like all other red colobus species (Struhsaker 2005), Oustalet’s Red Colobus is slow moving and is easily hunted. Hunting threatens populations in a number of areas, including portions of the range with low human population densities. At the northern and eastern edges of its range, the primary threat to this species is habitat loss and degradation. Large areas of the range comprise areas of rapidly advancing deforestation and agricultural expansion (Harris <em>et al.</em> 2017) and the species now appears to be absent in a number of locations where it was recorded historically. Further loss, degradation and fragmentation of the species’ range are expected into the foreseeable future. Projected to 2035, it is suspected that the population decline will exceed 30% over 30 years (equivalent to three generations), thus qualifying <em>P. oustaleti </em>as Vulnerable under criterion A4cd.","<p>Oustalet’s Red Colobus&#160;shows at least three distinct ecological modes, each covering significant portions of the range<em>. </em>It<em>&#160;</em>is found in contiguous, mature primary lowland tropical moist forest; seasonally- or permanently-inundated swamp forest, and in gallery forest and isolated forest islands in savanna woodland.</p><p>Large contiguous lowland forest blocks that contain important populations of this red colobus are found in Ituri, Rubi Tele and Aketi in DRC and in northern Congo. In these areas, this red colobus is recorded mostly in primary evergreen forest, though it also uses older secondary forest, and appears to prefer riversides and swamp forests. The species uses a range of mature forest types. In the Okapi Wildlife Reserve, they are found in monodominant stands of <em>Gilbertiodendron dewevrei</em>, where they feed on flower buds and immature seeds during periods of mast flowering and fruiting (J. Hart, unpublished observations 2007). They do not occur in younger secondary forest. In lowland evergreen forests, <em>P. oustaleti</em> can form large groups where they are not hunted. Counts of up to 70 animals were made in some groups in the Okapi Wildlife Reserve in the past (Hart <em>et al</em>. 2008); up to 50 in 2011, but the more recent dataset (which only covers about a quarter of the reserve at the time of writing) suggests that group sizes are now smaller (Wildlife Conservation Society, unpublished data 2018).</p><p>In the Ngotto Forest in CAR, this species only occurs in flooded riverine forests (Gautier-Hion &amp; Brugière 2005). Galat-Luong &amp; Galat (1979) reported that they spent 30% of their time below 10 m above ground and regularly enter into water to collect bulbs of aquatic plants. Large blocks of seasonally- or permanently-inundated forest are found in the west of the species range, in the confluence region of the Congo, Sangha and Ubangi rivers, including Lac Télé in Congo.</p><p>The eastern-most populations of <em>P. oustaleti </em>occupy small isolated forest islands and galleries on the Lake Albert escarpment. Semi-deciduous tree species dominate the high elevation gallery forests where <em>P. oustaleti </em>has been studied recently (Laudisoit <em>et al</em>. 2016, Scholier 2017). Home range size in some of these blocks is highly constrained, suggesting that these populations, which have no means of dispersal, are likely under periodic resource stress.</p>","<p>Habitat loss and hunting are the primary threats to this species. Habitat loss is particularly severe for the populations that occur in small forest islands and galleries at the northern and eastern limits of the range. Sources of deforestation in this environment include growing numbers of small holder farmers, expansion of nomadic pastoralism, small-scale logging and charcoal production. These latter threats are growing in a zone where ready sources of timber and fuel wood are scarce. Even low levels of firewood, house pole collection and timber harvest could have severe impact on populations in these areas, as they are constrained to very small home ranges and may be exposed to periods of stress exacerbated by the removal of key resources.</p>  <p>In parts of DRC, in portions of the range originally covered by contiguous forest, there are growing halos of deforestation around the population centres of Bunia, Isiro, Buta, Lisala and Gemena. A band of forest loss and degradation up to 100 km wide now isolates <em>P. oustaleti</em> populations in the Abubumbazi forest block. Commercial scale oil-palm plantations established in the Lisala area have led to permanent loss of habitat. Areas showing high rates of deforestation affect about 25% of <em>P. oustaleti’s</em> range (Harris <em>et al</em>. 2017). Forest loss in the current geographic range of the taxon totaled around 15,000&#160;km²&#160;between 2001 and 2016 (Global Forest Watch/WRI 2018).</p>  <p>Hunting, usually with shotguns, is a threat to <em>P. oustaleti</em>&#160;in a number of areas, including Buta and the Rubi-Télé Hunting Domain (T. Hart, pers. comm. 2007), and across the whole of northern Congo and southwestern CAR outside the areas protected by wildlife guards. Though hunting is not yet common in the Ituri forest, it appears to be a growing threat in the Ituri landscape, in the Okapi Wildlife Reserve and the adjacent, unprotected Mai Tatu forest (R. Mwinyihali, pers. comm. 2018). Widespread hunting was recorded in the Abubumbazi Forest in the northwest extreme of the species range in DRC, where no red colobus were recorded during a brief survey (J. Hart pers. obs. 1989). The bushmeat trade is active around Buta-Aketi (Hicks <em>et al</em>. 2010). Two red colobus were amng 169 monkey carcasses recorded for sale during 2007 and 2008 surveys (Hicks, unpublished data). One red colobus was among 21 identified monkey carcasses encountered between Banalia-Buta-Titulé in 2012 (Hicks 2014).</p>","<p>Given the size of its geographic range,&#160;Oustalet’s Red Colobus&#160;is likely to be among the more numerous of the red colobus taxa (Struhsaker and Grubb 2013). No estimates of <em>P. oustaleti</em>&#160;density are available; however, it has been recorded as common by a number of large-scale surveys. <em>Piliocolobus oustaleti</em> was the third most observed species in the flooded forests of Ngotto in southwestern CAR (Brugière <em>et al</em>. 2005), and was classified as common at eight of 12 survey sites covering the central portion of its range (Buta-Aketi Region) from 24 to 26° E (Hicks 2010, 2014, unpublished data). The species was among the most commonly recorded primates in surveys of the Okapi Wildlife Reserve between 1993 and 2011 (Grossman <em>et al</em>. 2008, Hart <em>et al</em>. 2008, Vosper <em>et al</em>. 2011) although the most recent information shows that its abundance has fallen relative to other species (Wildlife Conservation Society, unpublished data 2018). A large area in the eastern Ituri forest (Mai Tatu) also harbours this red colobus, although again it is now one of the least commonly recorded (Wildlife Conservation Society, unpublished data 2008, 2014).</p>",Decreasing,"<p><em>Piliocolobus oustaleti</em>&#160;occurs in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Republic of Congo (Congo), and has been recorded historically or marginally in South Sudan. It is also present in the extreme southwest of the Central African Republic (CAR). Its extent of occurrence (EEO) is estimated at 766,035 km². The eastern limit of its range is at about 31°E and includes the gallery forests and forest islands on the escarpments above Lake Albert. The northernmost record for the species is 4.50 N is northeastern DRC (Garamba National Park; Groves 2007). North of the Uélé River headwaters, the species has been historically recorded sporadically in gallery forests and forest islands in savanna from northern DRC to southern South Sudan. The Uélé River defines the northern limit of the range from about 210 through 270 E.&#160; Historically, the species was recorded near the forest-savanna boundary between Lisala and Gemena (M. Collet unpublished data 1983). The southern limits of its range are the Aruwimi (Ituri) River and the Congo River to its confluence with the Sangha river at 1013’ S. The western limit is the Sangha River up to the savanna-forest ecotone. <em style=""font-family: Cambria; font-size: 12pt;"">P. oustaleti</em> ranges from 350 m elevation at the confluence of the Sangha and Congo rivers, to 1,850 m in the gallery forests above Lake Albert.<br/><br/>The species appears to be absent from a number of locations at its northern and eastern limits, where it was known historically, including Garamba National Park (K. Smith pers. comm. 2018). Contrary to Gautier-Hion <em>et al</em>. (1999), <em>P. oustaleti</em> does not occur north of the Uélé River west of 27 0 E. This includes large undisturbed blocks of closed forest in the Bili-Gangu region where recent surveys documented a rich forest primate fauna, but failed to find this species (Hart 2012; Hicks 2010, 2014). It appears that the populations that have been documented in small forest islands and galleries in the northern Uélé headwaters, never ranged west across the open savannas of the Ango-Digba region to reach these closed forests. The Uélé River, at this longitude, apparently represents a major barrier to dispersal by populations from the forest blocks to the south.</p><p>  </p><p>&#160;</p>  <p><br/></p>  <br/><p></p>",This species is hunted illegally.

175604493,11146,Lagenorhynchus obscurus,Least Concern,,2019,2018-08-16 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The Dusky Dolphin was classified as Data Deficient (DD) on the IUCN Red List in 2008. The species remains extremely data-poor and DD was still considered potentially applicable in this assessment. Clarifying language in the Guidelines (Version 11, 2014) states that: “If the data are so uncertain that both CR and LC are plausible categories, the taxon can be listed as DD”. Although information is sparse, several Dusky Dolphin populations are large, seemingly stable, and not subject to high levels of anthropogenic threats, and the Critically Endangered category could not plausibly be applied to the species as it is currently defined. Therefore, DD does not apply. Given the large populations of all four subspecies and the fact that there are no current or historical major threats or signs of decline for three of the four subspecies, the Dusky Dolphin is assessed as Least Concern at the global species level.<br/><br/>However, the Peruvian/Chilean subspecies (<em>L. o. posidonia</em>) experiences a relatively high level of threat and likely warrants a higher risk category than the subspecies elsewhere in the species range. Although direct catching of dolphins for crab bait in southern Chile apparently has stopped, the gillnet fisheries that cause bycatch have continued, and the growth of the human population has likely increased throughout the range of the subspecies. Additional threats such as use for bait on longlines and even in drift gillnets targeting sharks and billfish continue (Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 1999, Mangel <em>et al.</em> 2010). Another known source of mortality is the industrial purse seine fishery for Peruvian Anchoveta (<em>Engraulis ringens</em>) (van Oordt 2007, Garcia-Godos 2007). Environmental effects such as the El Niño Southern Oscillation could also have an impact on this subspecies since its main prey, Anchoveta, is reduced during these events (Manzanilla-Naim 2011). It is anticipated that bycatch rates will remain stable or may even increase in the future and therefore it is likely that a population decline is occurring over most of the range of the Peruvian/Chilean subspecies where fishing and dolphin distribution overlap. Separate assessment of this subspecies is a high priority.</p>","<p>Throughout their global range Dusky Dolphins are associated with the continental shelf and shelf edge, ranging from the coastline to more than 100 km from shore and more than 2,000 m deep, although in all areas where they have been reported, the majority of animals are observed in water less than 500 m deep (Findlay <em>et al</em> 1992, Cipriano and Webber 2010). The species has been recorded to occur in cool temperate waters between 10 and 18°C (Brownell and Cipriano 1999, Würsig and Würsig 1980). Dusky Dolphin distribution is strongly associated with highly productive upwelling cells on either side of South America (Humboldt and Falkland) and off southern Africa (Benguela), with various cold-water currents around New Zealand (Brownell and Cipriano 1999) and in higher latitudes with several sub-Antarctic Islands. Although southeastern Australia is commonly reported as part of the species range, sightings there are very rare given the amount of survey effort in the region (Gill <em>et al.</em> 2000), suggesting that the species should be considered an occasional transient rather than resident, as noted by Cipriano and Webber (2010).</p>  <p>Dusky Dolphins consume a wide variety of fish and cephalopod prey, including schooling fishes such as anchovy, Sardine (<em>Sardina pilchardus</em>) and Horse Mackerel (<em>Trachurus</em> sp.), and more benthic species associated with the deep scattering layer such as hake (<em>Merluccius</em> sp.), lantern fish (<em>Lampanyctus</em> sp.), hatchet fish and a number of squid species. In Peru, analysis of stomach content for 72 individuals reported Peruvian Anchoveta as the main prey, followed by Slimtail Lanternfish <em>Lampanyctus parvicauda</em> and Inca Scad <em>Trachurus murphyi</em> (Garcia-Godos <em>et al</em>., 2007). On the basis of stomach contents and stable isotope methods, Dusky Dolphins in northern and central Patagonia feed on Argentine Anchovy (<em>Engraulis anchoita</em>), Argentine Hake (<em>Merluccius hubbsi</em>), Butterfish (<em>Stromateus brasiliensis</em>), and squids (<em>Illex argentinus, Loligo gahi</em>) together with few benthic prey (Koen Alonso <em>et al.</em> 1998; Romero <em>et al</em>. 2012; Loizaga de Castro <em>et al.</em> 2015). In southern Africa, analysis of stranded, caught and bycaught dolphins showed stomach contents to consist of 34.7% Horse Mackerel, 22.9% Hake, and 12.8% lantern fish with Sardine, Arrow Squid (<em>Nototodarus sloanii) </em>and Chokka Squid (<em>Loligo reynaudii) </em>also taken occasionally (Best and Meÿer 2010). In New Zealand, Dusky Dolphins near Kaikoura primarily feed on deep scattering layer-associated species, including squids (especially <em>Nototodarus/Todaroides</em> spp.) and lanternfish (Cipriano 1992). In winter, Dusky Dolphins in Admiralty Bay, New Zealand feed on Pilchard (<em>Sardinops neopilchardus</em>), Yellow-eyed Mullet (<em>Aldrichetta forsteri</em>), and Sprat (<em>Sprattus antipodum</em>; Markowitz <em>et al</em>. 2004). </p>  <p>To catch their prey, Dusky Dolphins use at least two different foraging strategies: forming large groups to herd and attack surface-schooling fish such as anchovies and sardines in ‘bait balls’ (Markowitz <em>et al</em>. 2004, Best and Meÿer 2010, Degrati <em>et al</em>. 2012) or predominantly nocturnal foraging on species associated with the deep scattering layer, which migrate closer to the surface at night (Benoit-Bird <em>et al.</em> 2004, Best and Meÿer 2010, Bernasconi <em>et al.</em> 2011). In the latter case, Dusky Dolphins appear to engage in a clearly diurnal movement pattern, returning close to shore during daylight hours when prey are too deep to access, probably to reduce the threat of predation from deep-water predators such as sharks and Killer Whales (<em>Orcinus orca</em>). Dusky Dolphins appear to modify their foraging strategy to adapt to the most abundant prey available and foraging strategy may vary over space and time. For instance, at Península Valdés, Argentina, Dusky Dolphins predominantly engage in coordinated diving during winter months (9.5% of the time) but engage in surface feeding on bait balls (diving drops to 0.1% of the time) during summer (Degrati <em>et al</em>. 2012). In both seasons, most of the groups observed diving were small (less than 10 dolphins). Similarly, in New Zealand, Dusky Dolphins predominantly forage nocturnally off Kaikoura on deep scattering layer-associated species (Cipriano 1992, Benoit-Bird <em>et al.</em> 2004), while the same animals also engage in shallow-water bait-ball feeding in the Marlborough Sounds (Markowitz 2004, Markowitz <em>et al.</em> 2004).</p>","<p><a name=""_Hlk518032173"">The threats facing Dusky Dolphins are most severe in western South America. The species was taken directly in the multi-species small cetacean fisheries of Peru and Chile in the 1980s, with the directed hunt for dolphins and porpoises expanding in Peru after the demise of the Anchoveta fishery in 1972 </a>(Read <em>et al.</em> 1988, Van Waerebeek and Reyes 1990, Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 1994). The fishing fleet from a single port in Peru could take over 700 Dusky Dolphins in a single year during the 1980s and 1990s (Van Waerebeek <em>et al.</em> 1997, Van Waerebeek and Reyes 1994, Read <em>et al</em>. 1988). For the port of Cerro Azul, central Peru, the total kill for a seven-month period was estimated at 1,567 cetaceans (Van Waerebeek <em>et al.</em> 1997) with total catches for the coastal waters of central Peru estimated at 10,000 small cetaceans (Read <em>et al</em>. 1988). Catches increased to 15-20,000 dolphins per year in the 1990s (Van Waerebeek and Reyes 1994), with Dusky Dolphins representing approximately 77.8% of these. Mangel <em>et al</em>. (2010) suggested that this level of take may continue to the present based on their estimated annual bycatch of more than 2000 small cetaceans from just one fishing port (including an estimated annual catch of 818 Dusky Dolphins) and the near-doubling in size of the small-scale fishery in Peru between 1995 and 2005 (Alfaro-Shigueto <em>et al</em>. 2010). Dusky dolphins continue to be taken incidentally or as bycatch in small-scale fisheries (mostly multifilament gillnets), and the practice of harpooning for bait continues (Mangel <em>et al</em>. 2010, 2013). Additionally, Tzika <em>et al</em>. (2010) reported the continued sale of dolphin meat for human consumption in fish markets in Peru. The absence of abundance data precludes any assessment of trends for Dusky Dolphins in Peru (Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 1997).</p>    <p>Incidental mortality in mid-water trawls off Patagonia in the mid-1990s was estimated at 400–600 Dusky Dolphins per year, primarily adult females, declining to 70–215 in the mid-1990s (Dans <em>et al</em>. 1997). Several hundred also died and presumably continue to die each year in various other types of fishing gear off Argentina (Crespo <em>et al</em>. 2000). Nevertheless, fisheries targeting anchovies or pelagic fish have very low effort as markets for Argentine Anchovy are not available, so at present there is no major concern related to incidental mortality. </p>  <p>In southern Africa, by-catch levels in fisheries are relatively low (Petersen and McDonell 2007, Best and Meÿer 2010), although there is an emerging threat in the form of mid-water trawl fisheries in the southern Benguela. A recent collapse (mid 2000s) of sardine stocks in the southern Benguela (Coetzee <em>et al.</em> 2008) may threaten long-term prey availability, while harmful algal blooms caused by dinoflagellates are increasing in frequency and occurrence (van der Lingen <em>et al.</em> 2015). Dusky Dolphins are not the target species of any commercial wildlife viewing industries in southern Africa, although they are approached when encountered, notably in Walvis Bay and Lüderitz, Namibia and Table Bay, South Africa.</p>  <p>In New Zealand, approximately 200 Dusky Dolphins were estimated to be captured in fisheries off Kaikoura in 1984 (Webber and Cipriano, unpublished data cited in Cipriano and Webber 2010). Current bycatch rates are likely to be lower due to gillnet bans put in place to protect Hector’s Dolphins (<em>Cephalorhynchus hectori</em>). Dusky Dolphins off New Zealand are the target for a number of commercial tourism industries, including swim-with and viewing operations. Threats posed by these operations have been addressed by multiple rounds of research and adaptive management response and are believed to be minimal at present (Lundquist 2014).</p>  <p>No information is available on bycatch levels from the populations of Dusky Dolphins associated with sub-Antarctic islands.</p>","<p>Availability of abundance and density estimates for locations throughout the range of the species are discussed below. </p>  <p><strong><u>Peruvian/Chilean Dusky Dolphin</u></strong>: No abundance estimates are available for this subspecies, but it is thought to have been seriously depleted by human activities over the course of many decades particularly off Peru (Read <em>et al</em>. 1988, Van Waerebeek 1994, Van Waerebeek <em>et al.</em> 1997, Mangel <em>et al.</em> 2010, Alfaro-Shigueto <em>et al.</em> 2018). </p>  <p><strong><u>Fitzroy’s Dusky Dolphin</u></strong>: The estimated total number of Dusky Dolphins off northern and central Patagonia, from Península Valdés to Golfo San Jorge (approximately 40% of the subspecies range) was 6,628 (95% confidence interval (CI) 4,039–10,877) in a series of surveys conducted between 1993 and 1996 (Schiavini <em>et al</em>. 1999). More recently in 2003 and 2004, Pedraza <em>et al.</em> (2005) estimated 4,756 (95% CI 2,083–10,858) Dusky Dolphins in Buenos Aires Province waters and 13,438 (95% CI 5,708 -31,638) in Patagonian waters. Given that the extreme south of the species’ range in Argentina was not surveyed, these results suggest that there are at least 20,000 Dusky Dolphins in Argentine waters.</p>  <p><strong><u>African Dusky Dolphin</u></strong>: No direct estimates of abundance are available for this subspecies. However, up to 0.9 groups/km were recorded during nearshore small boat surveys in the southern 400 km of the species range in South Africa, with this representing only the very coastal strip of their habitat (Elwen <em>et al.</em> 2010). There is a small hiatus in distribution between the northern and southern Benguela ecosystems (roughly 27° to 30°S) indicating that there may be some level of differentiation between these populations (Best and Meÿer 2010), although this has not been confirmed genetically. The species does not frequently come as close to shore in the northern Benguela Current (Namibia), but they were the most abundant species encountered during line transect surveys in the 400 km long x 30 km wide Namibian Islands Marine Protected Area in southern Namibia (Namibian Dolphin Project, unpublished data). It is estimated that the total number of mature animals in the African subspecies exceeds 10,000 (Elwen <em>et al</em>. 2016)</p>  <p><strong><u>New Zealand Dusky Dolphin</u></strong>: Markowitz (2004) used mark-recapture analysis of individually recognizable Dusky Dolphins off Kaikoura to estimate that 1,969 ± 815 dolphins were present in the area at any time, out of an overall abundance of 12,626 dolphins, not including juveniles. Genetic analyses by Harlin <em>et al</em>. (2003) estimated an effective female abundance of 15,700-17,500 individuals. No information is available for the abundance of Dusky Dolphins around the islands in the western South Pacific (Campbell, Auckland, and Chatham), but it is likely that these dolphins are part of the New Zealand subspecies, rather than a discrete subspecies.</p>  <em><u>Oceanic Islands</u></em>: It remains uncertain whether the groups in the South Atlantic (Gough and the Falklands) and Indian Ocean (Amsterdam, Prince Edward, and St. Paul) are discrete or regularly mix with animals in other areas (Brownell and Cipriano 1999).<p><span class=""datalabel1""><em><u>Current Population Trend</u></em>: Abundance is believed to be stable in the major subspecies of southern Chile/Argentina, southern Africa and New Zealand, although quantitative data are lacking. The Peru/Chile subspecies is likely undergoing a sustained decline due to multiple decades of uninterrupted human-induced mortality. Population trend for the species as a whole is unknown.</p>",Unknown,"Dusky Dolphins have a discontinuous distribution in the Southern Hemisphere associated with cool temperate coastal and shelf waters (Brownell and Cipriano 1999, Van Waerebeek 1992, Cipriano and Webber 2010). They occur in apparently disjunct populations in the waters off New Zealand (including the Chatham and Campbell Islands), central and southern South America (including the Falkland Islands) (Van Waerebeek 1993b, Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 1995, Crespo <em>et al</em>. 1997), and southwestern Africa (Best 2007). These populations have been assigned to four separate subspecies. Dusky Dolphins also occur around some oceanic island groups (e.g., Tristan da Cunha, Prince Edward, Amsterdam, and St. Paul Islands). The subspecies affinities of these groups are uncertain.","This species is the subject of a targeted fishery in Peru for use as wildmeat and bait (Read <em>et al.</em> 1988, Van Waerebeek and Reyes 1990, Alfaro-Shigueto <em>et al.</em> 2010, Mangel <em>et al.</em>, 2010). Dusky Dolphin meat was identified by molecular analysis of products obtained at three different fish markets in Peru, commercialized for human consumption (Tzika <em>et al.</em> 2010).<br/><br/>Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. (1994, 1997, 2002) reported a change in the composition of fisheries landings of this species from 77.5% in 1985-1990, to a 52.8% in 1991-1993, to 45% during 1995-1999 which was interpreted as a decline in the species due to impacts from fisheries. Continued incidental take in small-scale net fisheries in Peru, with bycaught animals either discarded or retained for use as food and bait, was reported by Mangel <em>et al.</em>, (2010) and (2013). In these studies, Dusky Dolphins were the second most frequently captured small cetacean after Common Dolphins (<em>Delphinus delphis</em>) at 29% and 20%, respectively. Information based on beach strandings (Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2018), suggests that bycatch continues in some sites of Peru, where Dusky Dolphins were the second most common species reported.",Marine,"<p>The species is listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).</p>  <p>Population structure and abundance has been little studied in most areas, and intensive photo-identification, genetic and survey studies are recommended.</p>  Bycatch in gillnets occurs at high levels in south America and needs to be investigated and monitored.
